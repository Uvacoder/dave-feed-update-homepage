          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:\n\nUsing cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally 🎉 #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq\n— Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021\n \nCross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:\nDrag and drop\r\n\r\nWith support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.\nTo drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that's dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.\nRelated Roundup: iOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Lets You Drag and Drop Images and Text Across Apps\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with \"dramatically improved\" speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: Jon Prosser\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Next iPad Mini Will Allegedly Feature Thinner Bezels, USB-C Port, and Touch ID Power Button\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "As part of its annual survey given to developers at the end of WWDC, Apple is asking community members whether, following two years of the conference behind held in a digital format, they would be open to attending an in-person conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \nImage Credit: Axel Boberg\n\r\n\r\nDue to the global health crisis, Apple has held its typically in-person Worldwide Developers Conference in an all-digital format for the past two years. The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the questions as part of this year's end of WWDC survey reads, \"How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community's outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple is contemplating the idea, and does plan to hold its first in-person event since the global health crisis began in the coming months. \nThis article, \"Apple Asks Developers Whether They Would Attend In-Person WWDC Following Two Years of Digital Format\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

On the pages, Adobe says that both apps will be removed from the App Store on June 21, and advises users who used the apps to switch to using its \"Photoshop Express Photo Editor,\" which requires either a monthly or yearly subscription for deeper photo editing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotoshop Mix was released on the App Store prior to when a fully-fledged version of Photoshop arrived on the iPad. It was Adobe's attempt to offer iPad users at the time some level of photo editing capabilities on the go.

None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end \"Pro\" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch.

          "description": "The next time you try talking on a FaceTime call on iOS 15 with your microphone muted, iOS will provide you a subtle reminder to unmute your microphone so others can hear you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new reminder, first spotted by The Verge, is part of a wider assortment of changes and new features coming to ‌FaceTime‌ with the release of ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this fall. Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, including those on Android and Windows, brand-new SharePlay functionality, and more. \nRelated Roundup: iOS 15\nTag: FaceTime\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"FaceTime on iOS 15 Alerts You If You Try to Talk While Muted\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. \r\n\r\nPre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date.

In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an \"evidence-based approach\" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those \"in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains \"very concerned\" about the data risks of TikTok users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's order says collecting of data from Americans \"threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,\" and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that \"pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States.\"\nThis article, \"President Biden Signs Executive Order Revoking Trump-Era Ban on TikTok and WeChat\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.\nThe ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices such as the PS4, and select smart TVs.

          "description": "Good overview of one of this week’s biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:\nApple’s iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it\nroutes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address\nfrom the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever\nmanages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is\ngenerally just one server between you and the website you’re\nvisiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ↔︎ VPN\nServer ↔︎ Website. Private Relay adds another server to the\nmix, which ensures that no one in the chain — not even Apple — can see the whole picture: You ↔︎ Apple’s Ingress Server ↔︎\nContent Provider’s Egress Server ↔︎ Website.\nThis is, as Apple calls it in their “Get Ready for iCloud Private\nRelay” WWDC Session on the topic, “Privacy by Design.”\nApple made specific mention that while the “Ingress Proxy” servers\nare run by Apple, the “Egress Proxy” (aka the server which\ncommunicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by\nApple and is under the control of “a (trusted) content provider”.\nThis means that Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting,\nand the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.\nI’m using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn’t seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail’s new tracker privacy protection), even though I’ve got an Apple One family account. I “fixed” that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1 — just figured I’d mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.\n ★",

The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, The Verge has learned.\nA camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission.\nSounds right.

Two tidbits on my spot today:\nIt seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is a new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.\n\n\nAnother question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.\n\n\n\n\n ★",

          "description": "Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:\nOne of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam\nLevine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he\nwas like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song\nand he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do\nwith this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this\nevolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with\nthis, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to\ndo this.\nSo we went after the labels and are going to the artists and\neducating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because\nwe have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a\nsimple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through\nthis software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This\nrequires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit\nback and listen, and really make the right calls and what the\nright things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s\nworth it. […]\nTo me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for\nmusic what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch\ntelevision that’s not in HD?\nOne of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take\nan old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on\nlow-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things\nwere recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back\nto a lot of the songs and be able to do this.\nThe article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.\n ★",

While users have been\nable to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,\ntoday’s development means a considerable boost in speed and\nperformance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent\nincrease in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent\nimprovement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.\nSpecific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster.

In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.\nI really do love the idea of these lotteries and giveaway promotions.

          "description": "Good column (and video) from Joanna Stern on Apple’s “walled garden”. The people who use the term “walled garden” in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that’s not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice — and the walls and gates can be what makes them nice. That’s been a recurring theme in the testimony from Apple executives in the Epic trial. Asked about rules and limits on iOS that Epic presents as nefarious — nothing but tricks to lock users in — Apple witnesses typically responded by presenting them as features. That iOS is wildly popular not despite the “walls”, but because of them.\nIt’s a trade-off, for example, that anything you can install on iOS can be trivially uninstalled just by deleting the app icon from your home screen. The downside is that iOS doesn’t support any third-party ideas that would require system-level background agents or extensions. I can name dozens of great Mac utilities that I’d enjoy, if not love, on iOS, but which can’t exist on iOS because of the rules. That sucks. But those same rules mean there’s no way to mess up your iPhone or iPad by installing something you don’t like and which is difficult to uninstall. That’s great.\nBetter than “walled garden”, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They’re fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They’re also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks. Public parks are great too — in very different ways. We should have great public parks, and we should have great open computing platforms. But not every park should necessarily be public, and not every closed computing platform would be better off open.\n ★",

          "description": "1,400 words to say they’d prefer a policy that allows teams within Apple to determine their own remote work policies. Good communication is to the point, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel “unheard”. It’s hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ✊🍆 vibes. The “formal requests” at the end about employees with disabilities and the “environmental impact of returning to onsite [sic] in-person work” are such transparent pandering. (I have never once heard of Apple not doing whatever it takes not only to accommodate employees with any disability, but to make them feel welcome.)\nAnd who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days remote is a huge change for Apple.\nGiven that these letters keep leaking to Zoe Schiffer at The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple is that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot of people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a mistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack. Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on site” policy wasn’t a request for comments — it was a decision — and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.\n ★",

          "description": "Dan Moren, writing at Macworld:\nMultitasking on the iPad is, to put it generously, a mess. Split\nView and Slide Over, first introduced in 2015’s iOS 9 and refined\na couple of times over the years, have always had the feeling of a\nband-aid slapped over a mortal wound. Their limitations (like the\ndance of getting an app that’s not in your dock into Split View)\nand awkward gestures (how many times have you activated Slide Over\nwhen you meant to simply swipe) feel cumbersome, especially\ncompared to the multitasking we’ve always had on the Mac.\nSo I’m hoping that 2021 is the year that Apple finally cracks\nmultitasking on the iPad. I’m not sure exactly what that looks\nlike; there are those who argue for the wholesale transplant of\nmacOS’s windowing system, but that seems as though it might be\nanother imprecise fit borne out of convenience rather than actual\nappropriateness. Fundamentally, though, the iPad has always been\nbuilt around the idea of one app on the screen at any time, and\nit’s clear that simply won’t do in a world where people expect to\nbe able to run multiple apps at once.\nIt’s amazing how often I make a slide-over Safari “window” on iPad without wanting to. And then I’m stuck with a new Safari instance with no actual tabs. You can get into Slide Over inadvertently, and if you do, it’s hard to undo it. It’s like instantly creating detritus you need to clean up. iPadOS is the only GUI system I’m aware of that has “windows” that don’t have close buttons.\nMy wife uses her iPad Pro more than any other device.

          "description": "Apple’s Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:\nThe Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the\nbiometric sensor; it doesn’t store biometric templates, perform\nbiometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,\nhaving to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).\nThe Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be\nsecurely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be\nused, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and\nmatching operations and enforces security policies in the same way\nit would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the\npairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nthat is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the\nuser if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely\npaired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure\npairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nkeyboards.\nSo I was wrong in my article on “secure intent” this week — the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does not contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it’s paired. But this contradicts the Platform Security page about “secure intent”, which states: “the connection is a physical link — from a physical button to the Secure Enclave”. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac’s Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.\nThe Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are\ncompatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch\nID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the\nSecure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match — and\nvice versa.\nI did not know this — nifty.\n ★",

Here’s the story of how bogus\nreviews on a counterfeit Microsoft Authenticator browser extension\nexposed dozens of other extensions that siphoned personal and\nfinancial data.\nAfter hearing from a reader about a phony Microsoft Authenticator\nextension that appeared on the Google Chrome Store,\nKrebsOnSecurity began looking at the profile of the account that\ncreated it. There were a total of five reviews on the extension\nbefore it was removed: Three Google users gave it one star,\nwarning people to stay far away from it; but two of the reviewers\nawarded it between three and four stars.\nFraudulent reviews are a scourge. Apple’s App Store is riddled with them — I’m not sure I’ve seen a single story about a scammy app in the App Store that didn’t have a bunch of 5-star reviews. Amazon product pages are riddled with fake reviews too. There’s a huge cottage industry in paying for fake reviews in any online forum where reviews can come from anyone.\nI don’t know what the answer is. Users think they like reading reviews from other users, but they have no idea how utterly untrustworthy unverified reviews are. There’d be outrage if Apple or Amazon simply pulled the plug on user-submitted reviews, or wiped the slate clean by nuking existing reviews and starting over with some sort of “verified reviewer” system. But the status quo is a cesspool of scammy reviews that many users believe they can trust. It’s a mess.\n ★",

But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap.\nBut here’s thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. From Investopedia, citing Snap’s 10-K for 2020:\nSubstantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,\nwhich accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in\nrevenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.\n99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.\nFind me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.\n ★",

The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, in partnership with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney itself.\n“In this new, standalone story,” Ubisoft says in the game’s description, “play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora.

Highlights, announced during the Ubisoft Forward livestream on Saturday, include a story expansion called The Siege of Paris, and an educational Discovery Tour mode similar to the ones made for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey.\nUbisoft did not give a specific launch date for The Siege of Paris, other than to say it would arrive this summer. The game’s first premium expansion, The Wrath of the Druids, just launched in May. That chapter took place in Ireland; this one takes players to France for “the most ambitious battle in Viking history,” Ubisoft’s Karen Lee told viewers. \nThe Siege of Paris is premium content, and will be available a la carte or with the game’s Season Pass. The new chapter also brings back “black box” missions, in which the player is given only a single infiltration objective. How they complete the task is entirely up to them.\nThe Viking Age Discovery Tour, like its two predecessors, will be a free update to all with the game. It’s a combat-free exploration mode and, like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s tour, it will allow users to create and pursue role-playing missions for the world’s inhabitants.\nAssassin’s Creed: Valhalla launched in November on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna services.",

The announcement  came at Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation on Saturday.\nOn June 30, Ubisoft will add cross-play and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege between all of its various PC platforms including standard PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna. Players from all three platforms will be able to queue into games together. For consoles, cross-play will be released in early 2022, when players on PlayStation and Xbox will be able to jump into games together. It does not appear that Ubisoft will let PC and console players compete together, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise.\nImage: Ubisoft\n  \nAccording to Ubisoft’s announcement, these updates will also include cross-progression across “all platforms” as part of one unified account, so you can earn rewards no matter where you’re playing. \n\n\nRight after the announcement of cross-play and cross-progression, Ubisoft also gave fans a new look at the game’s newest Defensive Operator, Thunderbird.

As seen in the trailer above, Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3, Pagan Min from Far Cry 4, and Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5 will be playable characters in post-release content for Far Cry 6.\nThe content appears dreamlike or hallucinogenic in nature, giving Ubisoft a narrative out for its Far Cry 6 DLC. Not that it’s ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5’s post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.\nThe season pass content also includes Far Cry 3’s DLC Blood Dragon.\nThe revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, “Vaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me. I still get recognized as Vaas, and I still feel the outpouring of love for that character - makes me very happy. Who knows... maybe I will reprise the role very soon?”\nFar Cry 6, by Ubisoft Toronto, launches Oct. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna platforms. The game stars Giancarlo Esposito as the primary antagonist; he is El Presidente, Anton Castillo, the autocratic ruler determined to crush an uprising bent on regime change.

The story brings back Aiden Pearce from the first Watch Dogs and Wrench from the second as playable characters.\nPearce, according to Ubisoft’s news release, has come to London to reconnect with his nephew, Jackson. He’s supposed to infiltrate a Broca Tech lab and steal some cutting edge technology — but Wrench gets the device first and flees. With his job botched, Pearce and his nephew are now on the lam from those who hired him.\nUbisoft’s statement says Bloodline is a prequel to the main campaign of Watch Dogs: Legion. It will also offer several side quests for both characters to complete.\nWatch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline is available a la carte for $14.99 to those without the Season Pass. The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn’t get it with one of two premium editions in the game’s October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.\nWatch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon’s Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.\nPost-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.",

The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game’s latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation. \nThe trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. \n\n\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege’s Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies — instead of the series’ usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020’s pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. \nJust like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series’ tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down — or escape from — infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege — including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  \nRainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

That’s according to an email that guitar maker Gibson let slip before Ubisoft could announce the video game at its E3 keynote on Saturday.\nPer the marketing email, Ubisoft is apparently partnering with Gibson again, as the company’s Epiphone, Kramer, and Gibson models of acoustic, electric, or bass guitars are specifically mentioned as compatible. A closed beta on PC will also begin soon, with registration open today.\nImage: Gibson via Ubisoft\n      A gif included with the email Gibson sent today.\n  \nNewcomers and returning musicians will find “an expansive library” of songs in Rocksmith Plus’s catalog. The program’s Riff Repeater, which can control a song’s speed to help players practice, also returns.\nThe first Rocksmith launched in 2011 but only for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That was followed two years later by Rocksmith 2014, considered a replacement rather than a sequel. That game launched for PC platforms in addition to the two consoles, and their successors.\nRocksmith 2014’s song library included 66 playable tracks on the disc, with more available as downloadable content. Saturday’s email did not specify how many songs would be available with the base game, or how deep the subscription service runs, or its pricing, for that matter.\nUpdate: Ubisoft formally announced Rocksmith Plus at Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward event.

Hackers reportedly stole FIFA 21 source code — for the game and its matchmaking components — as well as source code for EA’s Frostbite engine.\nA total of 780 GB of data stolen was stolen, Vice reported, including “proprietary EA frameworks and software development kits.” Hackers provided Vice with documents reportedly stolen in the hack, with information on PlayStation VR and other development tools.\n“We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,” an EA representative told Vice. “No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident, we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation.”\nHackers reportedly accessed EA’s internal systems through workplace chat platform Slack, which plenty of companies use for online communication. The hackers told Vice they obtained access to an EA Slack channel using “stolen cookies” sold online for $10. (Cookies can be used to access login details.)\nThe hackers said they contacted an EA IT support person via Slack for a “multifactor authentication token” — claiming they’d lost their phone — to login to EA’s network. The hackers provided Vice with screenshots of the steps taken in accessing the information; Vice later confirmed the details of the hack with EA.\nContents of the hack have not been released online, at least just yet. Vice reported that the hackers are looking to sell the data.\nEA has not responded to Polygon’s request for more information.",

Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.\nOne player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they’re tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It’ll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it’s controlled by a skilled player.\nWhile moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It’ll also be necessary to actively manage your player character’s fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.\nEvil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.\nThe story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana’s sister. Their planet — which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature — has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.\nWhat’s interesting though, is that this game expressly isn’t about war or conflict. “This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet –and the journey to keep it that way,” a description from the developers said. \nThe world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. \nA release shared that the visual style “combines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.” The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, “allowing its incredible artwork to come to life.”\nIn the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There’s a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. \nHowever, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It’s a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. \nPlanet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.",

          "description": "Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco\n    \n\n  \nFromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022\n Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.\nThe new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.\nElden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses!\nCheck out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.\n\n\nThe last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.\nMiyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.”\nFromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.\nElden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.",

Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.\nWe saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. \nThere’s an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.\nBloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021.

          "description": "Image: Summer Game Fest 2021\n    \n\n  \nPlus, two new roles: the Sherriff and the Scientist\n Among Us’ next update got partially revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream on Thursday, and it includes a new map, new colors and cosmetics, new roles, and a Hide and Seek mode. There’s no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.\nThe new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We’ll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.\nThere are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.\nAmong Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It’s a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it’s still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.",

We got a preview of the season’s changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.\nThe largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. \nMeanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what’s next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn’t clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. \nCall of Duty: Warzone’s previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo. While this patch certainly seems to be smaller than that, it does seem like it will have plenty of new additions to the game for players to check out over the next few months. \nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone season 4 will start on June 17.",

The grand strategy title was a keynote reveal of this weekend’s PDXCon, the annual gathering for all things Paradox Interactive.\nParadox’s Victoria series is a “society simulation” set in Great Britain during the time surrounding the industrial revolution. The most recent title was 2010’s Victoria 2 for PC. In the decade since, Victoria fans had beaten news or rumor of a sequel into a meme somewhat like the well-known Half-Life 3 meme. \nThis weekend, the meme died. A Paradox Interactive community manager took to the official forums this weekend to start a meme contest for the game, posting this picture of game director Martin Anward (which Anward himself tweeted out on Friday.)\nImage: Martin Anward via Twitter\n  \n“Victoria 3 is instantly one of the most highly anticipated grand strategy games in Paradox’s history,” the company said in a statement, obliquely acknowledging its meme status. In the game, players take one of “dozens of nations,” not just the U.K., and lead it through a time of societal change, technological innovation, economic turmoil, and geopolitical rivalries.\nParadox’s news release did not say when Victoria 3 would launch, but did say it would be available for Windows PC via Steam, Xbox Game Pass for PC, and the Paradox Store.\nAs for the meme contest, I don’t know who won, but this was my personal favorite:\nImage: Hemothep via Paradox Interactive forums",

That game, reportedly titled Final Fantasy Origin, is expected to be announced in June in conjunction with E3 2021. Square Enix is confirmed to appear at this year’s E3.\nFanbyte’s report follows a series of rumors regarding Final Fantasy Origin, which has been compared to FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The Final Fantasy spinoff is said to be “more accessible [than Nioh] for a wider audience” and set during the events of the first game in the franchise. Origin is reportedly bound for PlayStation 5, with a Windows PC version coming later.\nAnother component of the rumor surrounding Final Fantasy Origin is that Team Ninja will release a playable demo of the game this summer to solicit feedback from players. The studio similarly released “alpha” demos of Nioh and Nioh 2 ahead of each game’s final product.\nTeam Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. That game features two characters based on the original Final Fantasy, the Warrior of Light (pictured above) and Garland.\nSquare Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins.

Royal Court allows medieval rulers to hang out in a 3D throne room, meet with their courtiers, and hire bards to sing epic tales. \nRoyal Court fleshes out one of Crusader Kings 3’s most intriguing elements — managing your home base. Players have to deal with unruly vassals and rebellions, hold feasts, seduce lords, and ferret out secrets. Sometimes, the stories that take place in the player’s own royal hall are far more compelling than anything that happens over foreign borders.\nTherefore, it makes sense that Royal Court turns your throne room into a much more tangible place that players can decorate, show off, and fill with fun entertainment like woodworkers or, uh, angry bears.\nThe Royal Court expansion will also introduce hybrid cultures and new ways for cultures to develop and diverge over the years, allowing rulers to make new ways of life for their kingdoms and empires. A previous, smaller scale expansion in March added winter weather and Norse invasions.\nCrusader Kings 3: Royal Court will launch later in 2021.",

When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too.

What I like about this is that no critic or professional interviewer would ask these questions (they are “bad” interview questions) and yet Ma answers them all generously and thoughtfully. It reminds me a little bit of when Vogue trained an AI program to interview Billie Eilish:\nWhat I really loved hearing Billie say was that human interviewers often ask the same questions over and over, and she appreciated that the AI questions don’t have an agenda in the same way, they’re not trying to get anything from her.\n\n\nPerhaps with interesting subjects who are game, having “good” interview questions maybe isn’t that important, particularly if they are repeated queried about the same topics in every interview.\nTags: interviews   music   video   Yo-Yo Ma",

As someone who often struggles to find meaning in whatever it is I do here, this bit was especially good to hear:\nDo you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?”\nOr the inverse — something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance. We need it.\n\n\n(via swissmiss)\nTags: Ethan Hawke   video",

          "description": "Ever since I learned about bonsai trees as a kid, I’ve been fascinated with them. In my 20s, my girlfriend bought me a juniper bonsai for my birthday. I was really excited to see what I could do with it, but it was dead in a month and a half, forever dimming my enthusiasm for ever practicing bonsai myself. But I still love observing the process and seeing the results, so I’ve enjoyed watching Bucky Barnes’1 Bonsai Releaf videos. His latest video (above) documents the year-long transformation of a Japanese larch tree he purchased for £30 into something that looks like it’s been majestically clinging to a windswept cliff for hundreds of years.\nObservation, healing, experimentation, growth, making irreversible choices — so many lovely little themes, lessons, and moments in this video. At one point, well into the process, he clips off most of a long branch and I exclaimed “Oh my God!” out loud. I guess I still need to work on letting go of attachments.\n\nNo, not that one.↩\n\nTags: bonsai   Bucky Barnes   video",

          "description": "This chart caught my eye yesterday:\n\nIt’s from Robin Dunbar’s recent book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our Most Important Relationships. You might recall the author’s name from his concept of Dunbar’s number:1 that on average people can maintain about 150 friendships with others, a limit that is determined by human brain size and function.

          "description": "Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:\nFrom its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America’s pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation’s top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic’s collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (“If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,” Walensky said.)\n\n\nThe pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that’ll change for the better in the future.\nTags: COVID-19   Ed Yong   USA",

          "description": "Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world’s best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double — that’s three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what’s going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air — like absurdly and spectacularly high — and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing — it’s like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.\nIn reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: “How is that even humanly possible?” As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.\n\nSee also Who Could Jump Higher on a Trampoline, LeBron James or Simone Biles?

Blending seamlessly into the rest of the design, it should tell you everything you need to know, without you being aware of it.

To put it simply, typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. As the dial is the main point of interaction with a watch, it is arguably one of its most important parts, and certainly one that can produce the most emotion.

At one point, his heart rate is displayed on the screen and I’m certain that mine was in the same ballpark just before he landed. I recommend you also watch a video of the jump narrated by Aikins as he talks through what’s happening before, during, and after the jump.\nSee also Gary Connery’s 2012 jump — he fell 2400 feet from a helicopter and landed on a huge pile of cardboard boxes with the aid of a wingsuit, which slowed his vertical velocity to about 15 mph.\nFYI: The jump height of 25,000 feet seems impressive (and it’s probably trickier hitting the target from higher up) but in terms of speed, about 1500 feet is sufficient for a freefalling human in the spread-eagle position to reach their maximum (terminal) velocity of ~120 mph.

The secret is stamping different groove patterns into the pasta dough.\nThe solution: something Wang, Yao, and their co-authors term “groove-based transient morphing.” They found that stamping flat pasta sheets with different groove patterns enabled them to control the final pasta shape after cooking. According to the authors, the grooves increase how long it takes to cook that part of the pasta. So those areas expand less than the smooth areas, giving rise to many different shapes.\nThe team found that the pasta reached its maximum bending angle after about 12 minutes and retained this angle for around 20 minutes before it began to bend back. The researchers were able to produce simple helical and cone shapes, as well as more complex saddles and twists (the latter achieved by introducing double-sided grooves).\n\n\nI am assuming those grooves would also aid in holding sauce better, a topic we’ve delved into recently.

          "description": "Due to recent government reports, declassified data, media interest in those data & reports, and a long-simmering interest by the public, UFOs are back in the public imagination. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who is searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, says that there’s little chance that UFOs are aliens.\nI understand that U.F.O. sightings, which date back at least to 1947, are synonymous in the popular imagination with evidence of extraterrestrials. But scientifically speaking, there is little to warrant that connection. There are excellent reasons to search for extraterrestrial life, but there are equally excellent reasons not to conclude that we have found evidence of it with U.F.O. sightings.\n\n\nIf UFOs are alien craft, we would never see them:\nThere are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently visited by aliens, why don’t they just land on the White House lawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative, perhaps best exemplified by the TV show “The X-Files,” that these creatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us. But if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem surprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures technologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances between the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams at night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.\n\n\nMore people talking about a thing doesn’t make it credible. More people talking about potential evidence of a thing doesn’t make it credible. Evidence makes something credible.\nTags: Adam Frank   aliens   physics   science",

We only see a pitiful portion of it. Although it contains several hundred billion stars in its expanse, we can only see a fraction of a fraction of them.\nAnd even that doesn’t fully capture the essence of a galaxy, which also has planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and more. Galaxies are colossal objects, their true nature only becoming apparent to us a century ago.\n\n\nI know I’ve posted photos like this before, but every time I see something like this, my mind boggles anew at the sheer scale and magnitude of it all and I just have to share it.\nP.S.
