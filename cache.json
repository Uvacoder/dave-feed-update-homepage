The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Things Cloud \"Fractus\" is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Things Cloud \"Fractus\", however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings 3.14 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $49.99 and from the iOS App Store. The iPad version is priced at $19.99 [Direct Link] while the iPhone version (which includes Apple Watch support) is priced at $9.99.

          "description": "Apple announced earlier this year that, with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the Find My Network will be able to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the AirPods to a specific Apple ID, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌'s speaker holes to remove the linked account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst spotted by 9to5Mac, iOS 15 developer beta five code has confirmed that, to work with Apple's ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else's ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner's ‌Apple ID‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device's location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods Pro, AirPods Max\nTag: Find My\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods Pro (Neutral), AirPods Max (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"AirPods Find My Network Support Includes Tethering to Apple ID and New Manual Unpairing Process\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can't track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -> Privacy & Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using \"Clear cookies and site data\" in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, there's a new \"Forget About This Site\" option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirefox 91 is available now from the Mozilla website.\nTags: Firefox, privacy\nThis article, \"Firefox 91 Update Strengthens Online Privacy With Enhanced Cookie Protection\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Last year, a judge dismissed Apple's claim that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant's copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCiting court documents, The Washington Post reports that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple's grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLikely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year launched a program that would give security researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching security vulnerabilities and exploits. \nTag: lawsuit\nThis article, \"Apple and Corellium Agree on Settlement to Bring Lawsuit to an End\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefurbished iPads are covered by Apple's standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week.

          "description": "The 2022 iPhones and Macs may feature chips built on the 3nm process, as Apple's leading chip supplier, TSMC, is planning to begin mass production for 3nm chips destined for Apple in the second half of next year, according to a preview of an upcoming report by DigiTimes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paywalled preview of the full report, which will be published tomorrow, reads: \r\n\r\nTSMC is on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022 for Apple's devices, either iPhones or Mac computers, according to industry sources.\nEarlier in June, TSMC was reportedly beefing up capacity to begin production of 3nm chips, but DigiTimes at the time refrained from mentioning Apple as a potential initial beneficiary of the new process. Today's preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has already reportedly booked TSMC's entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year's iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple's plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We'll be sure to let MacRumors' readers know if the new report shares anything of significance. \nTags: digitimes.com, 2022 iPhones\nThis article, \"2022 iPhones and Macs May Feature 3nm Chips\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser\n\r\n\r\nKuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an \"all-new design\" with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nTags: Ming-Chi Kuo, TF International Securities\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Caution)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Kuo: Redesigned MacBook Air With Mini-LED Display and Several Color Options to Launch in Mid 2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The service is priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, and with that subscription price, all members of the family can access games. Apple also offers a one-month free trial for anyone, a three-month free trial for those who purchase an Apple device, and there are also often promotions for longer trial periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been working with both indie developers and big name gaming companies on ‌Apple Arcade‌ titles since it launched, and in April of this year, Apple began re-releasing classic titles like Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Mini Metro, Threes, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‌Apple Arcade‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew titles are added to ‌Apple Arcade‌ on a regular basis, and in the near future, the service will be gaining \"MasterChef: Let's Cook,\" \"Layton's Mystery Journey+,\" \"Asphalt Airborne 8+,\" \"Baldo The Guardian Owls,\" \"Tetris Beat,\" and \"Wurdweb.\"\nTag: Apple Arcade\nThis article, \"Apple Arcade Surpasses 200 Games\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today scored a victory in an ongoing patent dispute with Personalized Media Communications (PMC), with the judge overseeing the case tossing out the $308.5 million verdict that Personalized Media Communications won in March, reports Bloomberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple was a victim of PMC's plan to milk the tech industry for high royalties on old ideas, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said when delivering the verdict. The judge decided that PMC's patent for digital rights management is unenforceable because the company delayed its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to get more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC filed hundreds patent applications in the 1980s and 1990s, but no patents were awarded until 2010. The company took advantage of a loophole that allowed for an indefinite application process and then a patent valid for 17 years. This was addressed in 1995, but didn't apply to the patents used against Apple because they were filed earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC delayed receiving its patents until after the technology in the patent had already been adopted, letting it make more money from tech companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal documentation from PMC suggested the company had thought that Apple would be a \"natural candidate\" to target with delayed patents, along with Intel, IBM, and Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC won a $308.5 million verdict against Apple in March after a jury said that Apple infringed on DRM patents with its FairPlay technology that is used to distribute encrypted content through iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Won't Have to Pay $309M After Judge Accuses Patent Troll of Abusing System to Fleece Tech Companies\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, which is estimated to manufacture around 80 percent of the world's iPhones, has raised its new hires bonus to a record high of 10,200 yuan (U.S. $1,578).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, Lens Technology has doubled its bonus 5,000 yuan in February to 10,000 yuan in May, while Luxshare Precision's factory in Guangdong has doubled its internal referral bonus from 2,500 yuan in April to 5,000 yuan in May, with a top-up bonus of 3,800 yuan for returning workers who previously left the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past three years, Apple has added more new suppliers from mainland China to its vendor list than any other country, but simultaneously the growth of China's labor force has peaked as factory jobs have started to lose their appeal and more workers move out of industrial labor, leading to companies having to lure in workers with more attractive pay packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current aggressive hiring spree seeks to combat increasingly ramped-up production for the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTags: Foxconn, scmp.com, Luxshare\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Suppliers Struggling to Hire Enough Workers Ahead of iPhone 13 Launch\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Previously only the latter card could be used, so the addition of Mastercard means Instant Transfer is more accessible to users who want to quickly transfer money from an Apple Cash balance to a bank account without having to wait for the transaction to be processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says that beginning August 26, 2021, the cost of making an Instant Transfer will change to 1.5% (previously 1%) of the transfer amount, with a minimum fee of $0.25 and a maximum fee of $15. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf users don't want to use Instant Transfer, they can also transfer money to their bank account using ACH and receive it within one to three business days with no fee. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make an Instant Transfer, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Cash card, then tap the three-dotted icon. Tap Transfer to Bank, enter an amount, and select Instant Transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently only available in the United States, Apple Cash can be used to make and receive payments in Messages, or you can get Siri to send money to a friend or family member. \r\n\r\n\nHow to Set up an Apple Cash Card on iPhone and iPad\n\r\n\r\nWhen someone sends you money, it goes on your virtual Apple Cash card, which is stored securely in the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can use the money on it to send to someone, make purchases using ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ in stores, within apps, and on the web. \nTag: Apple Cash\nThis article, \"Apple Cash Instant Transfer Now Works With Mastercard Debit Cards\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

A career in music hasn't panned out, and he teaches fifth grade at a public school in the San Fernando Valley. His ex-fiancé Megan has moved out, and his high school buddy Victor has moved in. He knows he has a lot to be thankful for, but finds himself struggling with anxiety, loneliness, and self-confidence issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three-minute featurette sees the cast and crew discuss the show, and includes behind-the-scenes footage offering viewers a sense of Gordon-Levitt's creative production process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Darkly funny, oddly beautiful and deeply heartfelt, this relatable dramedy speaks for our contemporary generation of 30-somethings: rich with good intentions, poor with student loans, and yearning to become real grown-ups sometime before they die,\" said Apple, in a press release for the upcoming show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first two episodes of the 10-episode first season will debut on August 6, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple TV+ Shares First-Look at Comedy Series 'Mr. Corman' Ahead of August 6 Debut\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, \"designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data,\" according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by The Intercept revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys.

          "description": "One of the new App Store features coming in iOS 15 is something called ‌App Store‌ events, which will see Apple highlighting timely events within apps and games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is now experimenting with ‌App Store‌ events on ‌iOS 15‌ devices, and in the Today view of the ‌App Store‌ on iPhone, users can now see a notice about a TikTok Summer Camp event that's set to take place today. The event is also being shown on iPadOS 15, as noted by 9to5Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nListed as a card in the Today view, the first ‌App Store‌ event has a label with the time that it takes place and a link to download TikTok, which is the app that has the event going on. Tapping into it provides more information on just what the event is, and in this case, it is a Summer Camp session where creators and artists can share their expertise with fans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple, ‌App Store‌ events will be used to tell customers about game competitions, new movie premieres, livestreams, and more. Events will be shown in the Today view, but can also be found in the Games and Apps tabs, in search results, and on the app product page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‌App Store‌ events are limited to ‌iOS 15‌ devices, so the TikTok Summer Camp event does not show up on devices running iOS 14.7.1. Events will pick up as the launch of ‌iOS 15‌ approaches, and everyone will have access when ‌iOS 15‌ sees a public release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new app-related features in ‌iOS 15‌ include an ‌App Store‌ widget that lets you see stories, collections, and events in the Today View or the Home Screen, and a privacy-focused feature that tells you which apps have accessed your location, camera, microphone, and contacts during the last seven days.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: App Store\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Apple Starts Highlighting App Store Events in iOS 15\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The first episode premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday, August 20, with additional episodes to follow every Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\"Truth Be Told\" descends into the world of true crime podcasts. In season two, Spencer reprises her role as podcaster Poppy Parnell as she dives into a new case that involves her childhood friend, media mogul Micah Keith, played by Hudson. As developments unfold in the case, their lifelong friendship is put to the ultimate test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the novel by Kathleen Barber, Apple says \"Truth Be Told\" provides a \"unique glimpse into America's obsession with true crime podcasts\" and \"challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple TV+ is Apple's subscription-based service for original TV shows and films, with pricing set at $4.99 per month after a seven-day free trial or a lengthier trial with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple device. Apple TV+ is available through the Apple TV app on devices like the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, newer PlayStation and Xbox consoles, select streaming players from Roku, Amazon, and Google, and more.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Watch the Season Two Trailer for Apple TV+ Drama Series 'Truth Be Told'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Google today announced new updates that are coming to the Google Maps app designed for the iPhone. The most notable new feature is dark mode, which Google Maps app users have long been wanting. Dark mode is an alternative to light mode and allows for a darker user interface to match other dark mode apps on iOS devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Google, dark mode is going to be rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" and once available to you, it can be enabled in the Settings section of Google Maps. Google says that dark mode in Google Maps will save battery and \"give eyes a break.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple first introduced the Dark Mode feature with iOS 13, but it has taken Google some time to bring support to its apps. Google earlier this year began rolling out a true dark mode feature to Android users, and the iOS version of dark mode for Google Maps looks similar to the Android version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with dark mode, Google today announced the launch of new Messages integration. With this feature, Google Maps users can share their real-time location with friends in an iMessage using the Google Maps button in the Messages app. Location is shared for one hour by default, but there is an option to extend access by up to three days or stop access at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle's blog post also highlights the recently introduced widgets feature, which allows ‌iPhone‌ users to add a Google Maps widget to the Home Screen or the Today View. Widgets can be used to check traffic conditions or find nearby places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Google Maps app can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

          "description": "Apple must face a patent infringement lawsuit over the heart rate technology in the Apple Watch, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in 2018, Apple was sued by Omni MedSci, with the company alleging that Apple used its patented technology in the Apple Watch. Apple reportedly met with Omni MedSci between 2014 to 2016 to discuss a possible partnership, but Apple is said to have ended discussions and used technology from four Omni patents anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, Apple attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci is owned by Mohammed Islam, who has been described as a \"poster child for a patenting professional.\" He owns six companies and has collected more than 150 patents. In the past, he has used those patents to sue companies that include Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia, and Siemens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam is employed by the University of Michigan, and Apple's argument for dismissal was that his patents were owned by the university, which the University of Michigan supported on behalf of Apple. The appeals court decided that was not the case, and that Islam's employment agreement did not automatically assign his patents to the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci has claimed that Apple willfully infringed on its patents. The company is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of the Apple Watch, along with damages. Omni MedSci's attorney told Reuters that the company is \"pleased by not surprised\" by the ruling.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Can't Escape Apple Watch Heart Rate Sensor Patent Lawsuit, Court Rules\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the \"Apple Watch Edition\" collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple's retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn't stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.\r\n\r\nApple hasn't said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here's my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn't sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn't surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what's the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? \nAs Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of \"Apple Watch Edition\" models with ceramic and gold.

Telegram says it intends to continue increasing this limit \"until all humans on Earth can join one group call.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, video messages now have a higher resolution, and any audio playing on the user's device will keep playing when a message is being captured so that it's included in the recording. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, users can now tap on a video message to expand it in the conversation thread. Tapping on an expanded video message initially pauses it, and it's also possible to fast-forward and rewind the message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this update, the media player now supports multiple video playback speeds, screen sharing has been added to one-on-one calls, the in-app camera supports all zoom levels a device is capable of, and the media editor includes new tools to illustrate photos and videos with drawings, text, and stickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral other smaller tweaks and improvements have made it into this bumper update, and Telegram has further details in its latest blog post.

By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.\nTag: IDC\nThis article, \"Apple Shipped More Tablets Than Samsung and Amazon Did Combined Last Quarter\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They're IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for iPhone licenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang & Olufsen's website and in Bang & Olufsen retail stores. \nTag: Bang & Olufsen\nThis article, \"Bang & Olufsen Announces First Noise-Canceling True Wireless Earbuds\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple informed employees about the change in a memo:\n\"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated.\" The company added it is making the change \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nIn addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. \"Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it,\" reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Stores\nTags: Apple retail, COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice\nThis article, \"Many U.S. Apple Retail Stores Again Require Customers to Wear Masks\" first appeared on MacRumors.com",

          "description": "Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the \"A18\" or the \"M5.\" While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple's sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC's manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple's first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.\nTags: TSMC, nikkei.com\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier TSMC Readies 2nm Chips for 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.\nCook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: earnings\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Expecting iPhone and iPad Supply Constraints in September Quarter\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Researchers are rethinking plans to use the Apple Watch in studies after finding inconsistencies in the data gathered by the device (via The Verge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in the Apple Watch's heart rate variability data are reportedly caused by Apple tweaking the device's algorithms, meaning that data from the same time period can change without warning. Associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the Beiwe data platform, J.P. Onnela, told The Verge:\nThese algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they're not transparent. So it's impossible to know what's in them.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital exported the heart rate data from Apple Watches for the same period of time, but several months apart. The data should have been identical, but since it is filtered through an algorithm prior to export it was drastically different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple changes its algorithms regularly and without warning, so exporting the same data at different times may use different algorithms. Beyond heart rate variability, researchers looking into sleep tracking have experienced similar problems with changes to algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mostly precludes commercial devices from being used by researchers, resulting in the need for devices specifically designed to collect data for scientific studies. While this is adequate for some studies, it heavily constrains research into the medical value of commercially available products for users. Some researchers say that Apple should publicize the changes it makes to algorithms or make the Apple Watch's raw data available.\nRelated Roundups: Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch SE\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution), Apple Watch SE (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Researchers Struggle to Use Apple Watch in Studies Due to Sudden Algorithm Changes\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is developing an external display that includes an A13 chip with Neural Engine, according to a new rumor from 9to5Mac. The A13 chip with Neural Engine would presumably serve as an eGPU, though details are light at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a CPU/GPU built into the external display could help Macs deliver high-resolution graphics without using all the resources of the computer's internal chip. Apple could also combine the power of the display SoC with the Mac's SoC to provide even more performance for running intensive graphic tasks.\nThere were rumors back in 2016 that suggested Apple was working on a new version of the Thunderbolt display that included a graphics card, but no such display ever materialized. In fact, no Apple-branded display came out ahead of the Pro Display XDR that was introduced in 2019, and the Pro Display XDR is just a display with no GPU included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9to5Mac believes that the display with A13 chip would be a replacement for the Pro Display XDR, and it's possible that the release version of such a display would use an even more powerful chip than the A13 that was first introduced with the iPhone 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is also rumored to be working on a more affordable external monitor that would be sold alongside the Pro Display XDR, but this more affordable monitor is apparently separate from the version with a built-in A-series chip.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pro Display XDR\nTag: 9to5mac.com\nRelated Forum: Mac Accessories\nThis article, \"Apple Working on External Display With Built-In A13 Chip\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In the ‌Apple TV+‌ show, Sudeikis plays a small-time college football coach from Kansas who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second season has been widely anticipated and was promoted by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's April event. The show regularly takes pride of place at the top of Apple's official ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ website, and also has a line of official merchandise associated with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor its first season, \"Ted Lasso\" received a record-breaking 20 Emmy nominations, the most of any comedy in its first season. It also won multiple awards, including a Golden Globe for Jason Sudeikis, who plays the show's namesake main character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second season of the show, which consists of 12 episodes, sees Sarah Niles joining the cast. New episodes will be released every Friday on ‌‌‌‌Apple TV+‌‌‌‌. Apple has already renewed the show for a third season, which the creators of the show have hinted may be its last.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"First Episode of 'Ted Lasso' Season 2 Debuts on Apple TV+\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple will release a new version of the MacBook Air around the middle of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in note to investors seen by MacRumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upcoming ‌MacBook Air‌ will feature a 13.3-inch mini-LED display, which would make it the second Mac to gain mini-LED technology after the 2021 MacBook Pro, which is rumored to include a mini-LED display and is expected to launch later this year. Mini-LED display technology will bring a signifiant improvement in MacBook display quality, allowing for a thinner, lighter design while offering benefits like improved wide color gamut, high contrast and dynamic range, and truer blacks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo has said that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will include a mini-LED display in the past, and the rumor has also been echoed by DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior rumors have suggested the 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will have thinner bezels than the current model, and that it will adopt the same MagSafe charging technology rumored for the MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also expected to include a pair of Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, and there's also a chance that it could come in multiple colors, similar to the M1 iMacs that Apple released this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will use an upgraded version of the ‌M1‌ Apple silicon chip that's faster and more efficient. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that it will feature the same number of computing cores as the ‌M1‌ (eight), but that will offer nine or 10 GPU cores instead of seven or eight like the current model for better GPU performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo says that if component shortages improve in late 2021 and across 2022, MacBook shipments could grow to approximately 20 to 22 million units in 2022.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Kuo: Mini-LED MacBook Air Coming in Mid-2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Twitter's beta for iOS has gained \"Sign in With Apple\" functionality, with the end goal of allowing users to create Twitter accounts using their Apple ID, but still in beta, the feature is still not fully functioning properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered earlier this month that Twitter was working to port over Sign in With Apple to its service. Wong's report was based on code found within Twitter's website. With its beta app for iOS, Twitter is now properly testing the functionality, with some beta testers seeing a \"Continue with Apple\" option alongside continuing with Google or no third-party sign-up service at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its current phase, attempting to continue with Sign in With Apple may prompt some initial errors, and once through with an account made, there are some quirks. Firstly, when users use Sign in With Apple, they aren't creating a specific password for that app or service. Instead, the app links the service to a user's ‌Apple ID‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, with a Twitter account made with Sign in With Apple, it's not possible to change account information such as email and more since the app asks for a password. These are technical loopholes that will get ironed out before Twitter rolls out that feature to all users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter is also testing other new features for its iOS app, including a new edge-to-edge timeline view for photos and an internal dislike button for tweet replies.  \nTags: Twitter, Sign in with Apple\nThis article, \"Twitter Beta for iOS Gains 'Sign in With Apple' Option\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

All the resellers list the additional colors as out of stock until August or into September, so it's always possible Apple will also add them to its own online store at around that time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe aren't expecting any big product announcements from Apple until at least September with the launch of the new iPhone series, so the company may just silently add them to its accessory offerings for AirTag in the near future or tag them onto a big product press release.

Joining a network named \"%p%s%s%s%s%n\" could, in some cases, permanently disable WiFi on a device, and in many other cases, it required resetting an ‌iPhone‌ entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the beta testing process, it was discovered that the bug was no longer functional, and Apple's notes make it clear that the issue has been addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iOS and iPadOS 14.7 updates also address a number of other security vulnerabilities related to audio files, Find My, PDFs, web images, and more, so all ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users should update to the new iOS 14.7 updates as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also security fixes in macOS Big Sur 11.5, tvOS 14.7, and watchOS 7.6.

If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine sentencing based on U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO'Connor's role in the Twitter attack was previously highlighted by Krebs on Security, and in a 2020 interview with The New York Times, O'Connor claimed that he was not involved in the hack. \"They can come arrest me,\" he said. \"I would laugh at them. I haven't done anything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraham Ivan Clark, an 18-year-old considered to be the \"mastermind\" of the attack, was sentenced to three years in prison earlier this year. Mason \"Chaewon\" Sheppard from the UK and Nima \"Rolex\" Fazeli have also been charged in the attack and are facing prison time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 2020 attack, hackers targeted Twitter employees in a \"phone spear phishing attack,\" tricking them into thinking they were speaking to other Twitter employees. Using these methods, the hackers were able to gain access to Twitter's internal tools and were able to illicitly access Twitter accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties involved hacked into accounts belonging to Apple, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and more. Tweets were sent out from these accounts soliciting Bitcoin, and scammers received more than $100,000.\nTags: hack, bitcoin\nThis article, \"22-Year-Old UK Citizen Arrested for 2020 Twitter Hack Affecting Apple\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "A common form of malware on Windows systems has been modified into a new strain called \"XLoader\" that can also target macOS (via Bleeping Computer).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDerived from the Formbook info-stealer for Windows, XLoader is a form of cross-platform malware advertised as a botnet with no dependencies. It is used to steal login credentials, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, and execute malicious files. The malware was discovered by security researchers at Check Point Software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA server hosting the macOS version of XLoader is available to bad actors on the dark web for $49 per month. Check Point tracked XLoader for a six-month period, seeing requests from 69 countries, indicating significant use across the world. More than half of all victims were based in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormbook continues to be a prevalent threat, being part of over 1,000 malware campaigns in the last three years, and XLoader is expected to have even wider use given its cross-platform capability and greater level of sophistication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHead of Cyber Research at Check Point, Yaniv Balmas, said that macOS's growing popularity has exposed it to increasing attention from cybercriminals, who see the platform as a worthwhile target.\nWhile there might be a gap between Windows and macOS malware, the gap is slowly closing over time. The truth is that macOS malware is becoming bigger and more dangerous.\nAccording to Check Point, XLoader is stealthy enough for it to remain hidden to most users. It is possible to check for its presence by using macOS's Autorun to check the username in the OS and look into the LaunchAgents folder, where entries with suspicious filenames should be deleted.\nTag: malware\nThis article, \"Common Windows Malware Can Now Infect Macs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

This \"stage light\" effect could lead the backlighting system to fail entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepair site iFixit found that the problem was caused by a delicate flex cable that was prone to wearing out and breaking after repeated opening and closing of the display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple updated the design of the display flex cable with the 2018 MacBook Pro, and launched a free repair program in May 2019 that covered the 13-inch MacBook Pro models from 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe now-dismissed class action lawsuit was seeking restitution for all costs attributable to repairing or replacing affected MacBook Pro models, and it called on Apple to expand the free repair program to cover 15-inch MacBook Pro models.\nTags: lawsuit, Flexgate\nThis article, \"'Flexgate' Class Action Lawsuit Over Faulty MacBook Pro Displays Dismissed by Judge\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The production hub could exceed half a million square feet in size since it needs to provide enough space to produce multiple TV shows and movies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the city's available spaces for production are said to be heavily booked for months in advance by studios that need a constant output of content, prompting companies to acquire space for themselves directly or lock-in locations with leases that reserve the space for several years at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Mosallam joined Apple in January this year as a lead production real-estate executive for Los Angeles, apparently looking to oversee the company's soundstage strategy. He previously worked as Netflix's director of production planning and studio leasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is reportedly hoping to deepen its presence in Hollywood by opening the campus. The company currently leases individual soundstages to film for ‌Apple TV+‌ in Los Angeles and other areas around the world, but a dedicated campus could streamline the production process and reinforce Apple's commitment to compete with other video streaming services.\nTags: wsj.com, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple Looking to Establish a Large Production Campus in Los Angeles for Apple TV+\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "LG has agreed to sell Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches at its \"LG Best Shops\" in South Korea from August, according to a report by the local Herald Economic Daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple products will go on sale at 400 LG stores across the country. As part of the agreement between the two parties, all Macs are excluded from the sales, since LG's laptop offerings overlap with Apple computers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news comes after initial stumbling blocks over the proposed deal appeared to make an agreement unlikely. According to the report, LG faced stiff resistance from the National Mobile Communication Distribution Association, which viewed the proposal as a direct violation of an earlier \"win-win\" competition agreement to do with the sale of mobile phones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, a \"negotiable in case of change\" clause in that agreement has been cited by the regulatory bodies to argue that it is too early to judge whether LG is in violation, given its changed position in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLG Electronics recently announced its withdrawal from the smartphone business, and when it completely withdraws from the mobile business at the end of this month, retail space previously used for marketing its handsets will be vacant. Apple meanwhile saw an opportunity to increase its retail presence in Korea, and the two companies began negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKorea's Distribution Association is reportedly awaiting LG's official statement on the matter while it renegotiates the win-win agreement once it starts selling Apple's products in its stores.\nTags: LG, Korea\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Agrees to Deal to Sell iPhones in Korean LG Retail Stores From August\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The keyboard is available in gray for $199.95.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNanoleaf, known for its range of smart lighting panels, recently launched new HomeKit-enabled \"Elements Wood Look\" hexagon lights with a wood grain veneer designed to offer a more natural lighting experience that blends in better with home decor and creates a cozy ambiance in the room.

Rumors about the ‌Apple Car‌ have suggested that leadership issues and internal strife have impacted the project, which is perhaps no surprise given what a massive undertaking it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to bringing the Apple Watch to fruition, Lynch worked at Adobe and helped create Creative Cloud, plus he has worked on Apple's healthcare strategy team, so he has a diverse background. Business Insider says that his title will not change and he will continue to be involved with both the Apple Watch and Apple's health initiatives, but he is stepping back from Jeff Williams' health care staff and will be replaced by director of health software engineering Evan Doll on that team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is now at a stage where it is sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the ‌Apple Car‌, requiring more hands-on help from experienced executives within Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork on an ‌Apple Car‌ is still in the early stages and multiple sources have said that a finished self-driving vehicle could be released sometime between 2025 to 2028.

          "description": "Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that it will begin mass production operations at its new factory in Arizona in 2024, Nikkei Asia reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC Chairman Mark Liu announced that the company's $12 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona, which is currently under construction, will begin mass production in the first quarter of 2024. While the 2024 timeframe had previously been rumored by Bloomberg, TSMC's announcement serves as a confirmation and indicates that the project is on track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first batch of engineers hired to staff the new U.S. factory arrived in Taiwan in late April this year for training, and the company is looking to accelerate its schedule for the facility as much as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility will mass-produce chips fabricated with a 5nm process. TSMC has been gradually miniaturizing its process over the years, going from a 16nm A10 chip in iPhone 7 models, to a 7nm A13 chip in iPhone 11 models, and most recently a 5nm process for the iPhone 12's A14 chip. Likely clients for the chips made in the Arizona factory include Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple. The new Arizona plant will make it theoretically possible for Apple's 5nm custom silicon chips, such as the A14 or M1 chip, to be manufactured within the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC's main factories are located in Taiwan, but it already operates a factory in Camas, Washington, as well as design centers in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California, meaning that the Arizona facility will be its second manufacturing site in the United States. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside the news about the Arizona factory, TSMC also said that it was looking into chip production sites in Japan, likely for chips destined for Sony devices, and set out the intention to build up overseas manufacturing capacity to ensure long-term competitiveness.\nTags: TSMC, Arizona\nThis article, \"Apple's Chip Partner TSMC to Begin Mass Production of 5nm Chips at New Arizona Factory in 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As pandemic-related restrictions ease in the United States, the Chicago-based research firm said increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Apple did very well as it emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Josh Lowitz, a CIRP co-founder. \"Increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models as they retired older phones and shopped more at Apple's own retail locations to buy those iPhones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shift to more expensive models resulted in the iPhone's average selling price in the United States rising to $869 in the June 2021 quarter, added Lowitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research note also indicates that Apple experienced a significant increase in iPhone sales through its retail operations, including both physical stores and online. In the June 2021 quarter, 27% of iPhone sales in the United States were completed through Apple, compared to a previous high of 21% in September 2020, according to CIRP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRP bases its findings on its survey of 500 customers in the United States who purchased an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch in the April-June 2021 period.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro\nTag: CIRP\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 12 (Caution), iPhone 12 Pro (Caution)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 12 Pro Max Seeing Strong Demand in U.S. as Consumer Spending Rises\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "ElevationLab, known for its range of useful accessories for Apple's devices, today introduced the MagBase, which is designed to increase the functionality of Apple's MagSafe Charger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $9.95, the MagBase is a small attachment that fits onto the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger. It has a micro air suction surface at the bottom, which ElevationLab has used in prior products. This micro air suction is not adhesive, but it's quite strong and is able to keep the MagBase securely attached to a desk or a table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagBase has multiple functions when used with a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger. If you pull upwards on an iPhone that's on the MagBase, the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌MagSafe‌ charger will come up, which is useful if you need to check something while still continuing to charge. When you're done, it can be set right back in the MagBase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to pick up the ‌iPhone‌ and leave the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger attached to the MagBase, you can use a quick slide gesture to remove the ‌iPhone‌, which leaves the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger right where it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of the MagBase adds on an additional 3-ft USB-C cord that attaches to the USB-C end of the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, so you have more cord to work with when using it at a desk. It increases the length of the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger cable from three feet to six feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the MagBase is barely larger than the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, it takes up minimal space while on a desk while also providing a useful and versatile base for housing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagBase can be purchased from the ElevationLab website for $9.95.\nThis article, \"ElevationLab's 'MagBase' Docks Your MagSafe Charger to Your Desk\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Tabs were also all arranged at the top of the display to minimize the space taken up at the top of a Safari window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ‌macOS Monterey‌, Apple has walked this back. There's a dedicated URL/search bar at the top of the Safari window, with the tabs arranged below it. Clicking on a tab makes it the active window and it's easier to drag tabs for rearranging or opening in a new window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's still quite far off from the current Safari design in ‌macOS Big Sur‌, but it's certainly an improvement over the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new and separate tab bar is enabled by default when upgrading to ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta three, but Apple has included an option to revert to the original Monterey design. If you to go View and toggle off \"Show Separate Tab Bar,\" you can use the original design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 3 also appears to lay the groundwork for Universal Control.

When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound, and if you have HomeKit cameras, you can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.\nThis article, \"Apple Seeds Third Beta of tvOS 15 to Developers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.\nFor everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:\nYou know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled\ndocuments open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some\nnotes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s\namazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose\nyour carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,\nbut we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and\neasier: Notes.\nNotes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you\ndon’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you\ndon’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.\nNotes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format\ninvolved. […]\nThere are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits\nyour workflow and style.\nNotes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).\nSee also:\nJason Snell, who wrote a nifty AppleScript that lets him drag an image into a Markdown file in BBEdit 14, and have it (a) upload that file to his server in the background, and (b) insert the Markdown syntax to reference that just-uploaded file.\n\n\nWatts Martin, who has a good overview of where BBEdit 14 stands compared to several popular competing programming text editors.\n\n\n\n\n ★",

It will help limit the risk of transmission at destinations where unvaccinated people travel—and, by setting norms that restrict certain privileges to vaccinated people, will also help raise the stagnant vaccination rates that are keeping both the economy and society from fully recovering.\nFlying is not a right, and the case for restricting it to vaccinated people is straightforward: The federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety. And although air-filtration systems and mask requirements make transmission of the coronavirus unlikely during any given passenger flight, infected people can spread it when they leave the airport and take off their mask.\n ★",

And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.\nLess mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.\nGoogle is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone.\n“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google really means it this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.\n ★",

Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:\nMany may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and\ndistancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well\nenough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did\nwhen we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are\nless likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed\nby those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be\nfought and ignored by those who aren’t.\nHospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because\nsomeone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring\nbecause too many people are not immunized.\nThis is why I’ve advocated vaccine mandates. I don’t understand\nhow we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.\nHere’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:\nA year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an\nobviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of\n2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread\nof Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term\nsolution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the\nworld could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.\nNow those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of\nsummer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a\nmask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and\nfederal governments — should consider mandating something else\nfirst: vaccination.\nAsking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. The backlash is growing.\n ★",

          "description": "Juli Clover, MacRumors:\nPrior to this beta, Safari on iPad was similar to Safari on iOS\nwith no dedicated tab bar, but after the update, Apple has added a\ndedicated tab bar that’s activated by default, which is the same\nlayout that’s now used in macOS Monterey.\nWhile the separate tab bar is enabled automatically when updating,\nin the Safari section of Settings, there is an option to toggle on\nthe original compact tab bar that merged everything together.\nThis is a significant improvement for Safari on iPad, and showing the tab bar is the correct default. If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.\n ★",

That’s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar.

But there’s an awful lot of non-sharing stuff crammed into the Share menu — the ᴀA menu items from the current version of Safari (text size, Reader mode, disabling content blockers temporarily, etc.) are all in “Share” now. It’s better than the “···” menu in betas 1–3, but really, this is more like changing the “···” glyph to the Share glyph. It’s still two menus’ worth of features stuffed into one monolithic menu.\n\n\nThe Reload button is back. But it’s bizarrely tiny — way smaller than the minimum recommended tap target size of 44 x 44 points. And it shares space with the newly restored Reader mode button. When you load a page, if Reader mode is available, the Reader mode button shows briefly (maybe for 1–2 seconds?) along with the text “Reader Available” under the website’s domain name. But then the “Reader Available” label fades out and the Reader mode button turns into the Reload button. To enable Reader mode at this point, you either need to long-press the URL domain name to bring up a shortcut menu, or tap the — you guessed it — Share button, which has its own “Reader” item near the top.\n\n\nBookmarks are supposed to be easier to access, but I think most users accustomed to previous versions of Mobile Safari — which heretofore has always had a bookmarks button right in the main toolbar — are going to struggle to find them.\n\n\n\nApple is clearly trying to address the numerous complaints about the Safari 15 design for iPhone, but beta 4 feels like they’ve decided that the solution to finding themselves in a hole is to dig faster.\n ★",

Finally decided to tell a bit of that story here.\nHis story:\nI created the original concept and pitch for Chrome Home in 2016. It was based off two insights:\nPhones were growing in size, and we had opportunity to innovate in creating a gestural, spatial interface that would still be usable with one hand.\n\n\nMobile Chrome was also growing in features — but because its minimalist interface kept everything behind a “three dot” menu, these features were underutilized and hard to access.\n\n\n\nThe idea caught traction internally, eventually becoming a Chrome org priority. […]\nWe heard a mixture of reactions. The feature gained a cult following among the tech community, but for many mainstream users, the change felt disorienting. Chrome serves billions of users around the globe with varying tech literacy. Over the course of many iterations, I became increasingly convinced that launching Chrome Home would not serve all our users well.\nSo just as I strongly as I had pitched the original concept, I advocated for us to stop the launch — which took not a small amount of debate.\nReally curious to see what the next betas of Safari look like on iOS and iPadOS. I spent all weekend with my spare phone running iOS 15 b3 and the new Safari design is not growing on me, at all.\n ★",

He argued that gas-electric hybrids like the Prius and hydrogen-powered cars should play a bigger role, according to four people familiar with the talks.\nBehind that position is a business quandary: Even as other automakers have embraced electric cars, Toyota bet its future on the development of hydrogen fuel cells — a costlier technology that has fallen far behind electric batteries — with greater use of hybrids in the near term. That means a rapid shift from gasoline to electric on the roads could be devastating for the company’s market share and bottom line.\nThis sounds like a once-great company that has lost its way.

          "description": "Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:\nStarting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads through a web app people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games. […]\n“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”\nThere’s a lot to roll your eyes at in this brief statement, but the big one is the last clause, implying that Apple’s stance on cloud gaming has anything at all to do with pushing people to buy the “latest and most expensive devices”. Say what you want about Apple’s App Store policies, they go to great lengths to keep older devices relevant for as long as possible — including with their own library of Apple Arcade games.\nWill be interesting to see if these web app games are actually good, and if so, actually become popular.\n ★",

When iOS 15 lands later this year, users will be given the option to update to the latest version of iOS or to stick with iOS 14 and simply install the latest security fixes.\n“iOS now offers a choice between two software update versions in the Settings app,” Apple explains (via MacRumors). “You can update to the latest version of iOS 15 as soon as it’s released for the latest features and most complete set of security updates. Or continue on  iOS 14  and still get important security updates until you’re ready to upgrade to the next major version.”\nI missed this news last month, and misspoke about it on the latest episode of my podcast, while talking about holding onto iOS 14 indefinitely if Apple doesn’t sufficiently improve the design for Safari in iOS 15.\n ★",

His email:\nYour incessant corona whinery is getting rather long in the tooth,\nbut this disgusting gloating piece takes the cake.

I am sad and I am angry about the state of vaccination denial, and the roles that powerful sources like Fox News and Facebook — neither of which should be trusted by anyone but both of which are trusted by zillions — have played in promoting it.\nYou don’t need any aptitude for numeracy at all to look at numbers like these from Texas to see that if you can get vaccinated for COVID, you should, as soon as possible.

Indeed, that’s not just their\nmedical advice to you — it’s their stated belief (and I agree)\nthat getting vaccinated is a pro-social means of safeguarding your\nentire community.\nSo I am saying, with a full understanding of the process, that the\nFDA ought to bring the official regulatory status of mRNA Covid\nvaccines into line with the scientific community’s actual\nunderstanding and attitude toward the vaccines.\nThe government is not worried that Pfizer and Moderna might be\nrunning a scam on us. They are charging $20 a dose, not\n$56,000. We are begging people to take these shots. So we\nshould act like it.\nFDA formal approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn’t the entirety of his argument, but it comes first because it’s so obvious. And the next steps — mandating the vaccines in places like schools and the military — require FDA formal approval.\n ★",

          "description": "Re: yesterday’s piece about window proxy icons, Zack Katz found this archived version of Apple’s developer docs on the feature for Mac OS 8.5:\nAn application typically tracks the modification state of a\ndocument. A common reason to do so is to inform the user that they\nhave made changes to the document which they might wish to save\nbefore closing the window.\nWhen your application uses proxy icons, it should inform the\nWindow Manager when a document has unsaved changes. When you do\nso, the Window Manager displays the document’s proxy icon in a\ndisabled state and prevents the user from dragging the proxy icon.\nDisabled proxy icons cannot be dragged because unsaved documents\ncannot be moved or copied in a manner predictable to the user.\nFigure 1-3 shows a proxy icon in a document window with unsaved\nchanges.\nKatz tweeted::\n@gruber I found this Mac OS 8.5 proxy icon documentation a great\nread. It made me nostalgic — imagine being able to see saved\nstate quickly just by seeing the icon and title color!\nThings have gotten so low-contrast…\nLow contrast indeed.

They’re all radical but none as\nin-your-face radical as the iOS 15 version for the iPhone, which\npulls the address bar to the bottom and hides a ton of controls\nbehind a menu-hamburger button.\nWe recorded this before today’s release of the third developer betas for iOS 15 and MacOS 12 Monterey, but it all holds up. The good news is that today’s betas show that Apple has taken criticism of the new Safari UI designs seriously — on MacOS, Safari once again defaults to showing the tab bar as a discrete UI element in the window, with one URL address bar. (Similar changes are coming for iPadOS, but didn’t make it for today’s beta.) The iOS changes today aren’t as significant, but, having talked to folks at Apple, there are a lot of changes and refinements still to come as summer progresses. I feel good about what I’ve heard.\n(Something I missed in my critique of the Safari 15 betas two weeks ago: you can long-press on the domain name to the left of the “···” button in the floating toolbar to bring up a contextual menu. That contextual menu contains a Share item, and today’s beta 3 adds a Reload item (screenshot). I still say Share and Reload are both important enough that they should be exposed as top-level buttons, but knowing that this long-press menu exists is a great tip if you’re already using the betas.)\n ★",

Rob Thomas, who has led IBM’s Watson initiative in the\npast, will become the new senior vice president of global markets.\nDid you catch this story 12 days ago? I almost didn’t.

They’ve been diminished not because the government broke them up or curbed their behavior through regulations, but simply because they faded away. It is extremely difficult to become dominant in tech, but it’s just as difficult to stay dominant for longer than a short run.\nI don’t offer this observation as an argument against any and all regulation and antitrust investigations of big tech companies.

          "description": "Image: Riot Games\n    \n\n  \nWelcome to Bandle City\n The world of Legends of Runeterra is about to get a whole lot cuter. On Wednesday, Riot Games released an animated trailer revealing the next set of champions and locations from League of Legends to come to the franchise’s card game. Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards. This includes 9 new champions, including some from outside Bandle City like the Piltover sheriff Caitlyn.\nThe new expansion will also have new keywords that reflect the whimsical nature of the Yordles. In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.\nIt also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her. However, the bulk of the Bandlewood expansion should focus on yordles and their mischief. Beyond the Bandlewood is set to release on Aug. 25.",

It’s the Dragonborn. \nThanks to a new mod that adds Link’s paraglider from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Skyrim, you can now float across the land just like the hero of time would. The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. \nThe “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. \nIn the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.\nSimilar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. \nThe mod doesn't add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!",

The upgrade is free for anyone who has the game, which includes subscribers to Xbox Game Pass. \nThe upgrade is only for the new Xbox consoles. Hellblade studio Ninja Theory says an update for PC “is currently in development,” but there are no plans to offer it for any other platforms. Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Windows PC. Microsoft acquired Ninja Theory in June of 2018.\nThe optimized Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice gives players three visual fidelity settings — performance, resolution, and enriched, with the latter offering ray tracing on both Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Enriched mode supports dynamic resolutions up to 4K on Series X, and full HS on Series S, at 30 frames per second for both consoles.\nPerformance mode on Series X offers dynamic resolutions to 1080p at 120 Hz frame rates; it’s full HD and 60 fps on Series S. Resolution mode on Series X prioritizes dynamic resolutions to 4K, at 60 fps; Series S gets dynamic resolution support to 1440p at 30 fps.\n“Also being added: Texture resolution bump, Chapter select, increased particle quality, increased draw distance, higher levels of detail,” the game’s official website says.\nNinja Theory said QLOC, the company behind Hellblade’s port to Nintendo Switch in 2019, handled the optimized version upgrade, freeing the studio to continue working on Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. In June, the studio indicated the sequel was still early in development, likely the reason why it wasn’t shown at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase for E3 2021 that month.

          "description": "Image: Blizzard Entertainment\n    \n\n  \nThey follow T-Mobile in the midst of a troubled time for Blizzard\n The Overwatch League faces further turmoil, according to a new report. Coca-Cola and State Farm are re-considering their partnerships with the League in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the state of California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of widespread sexual harassment and discrimination.\nAs reported by the Washington Post, two of the Overwatch League’s major sponsors are “re-assessing” their relationship with the League. State Farm and Coca Cola are two of the League’s seven sponsors listed on their website, along with IBM, Xfinity, Cheez-It, Pringles, and TeamSpeak.\nBrand deals are one of the ways to measure success for a competitive ecosystem like the Overwatch League. The League lost T-Mobile as a sponsor on Tuesday, and it appears as though others may soon follow.\nIn a statement to the Post, a representative of State Farm said that the insurance provider was “reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League” and the company has requested that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.” A spokesperson for Coca-Cola shared a similar sentiment, saying that the company is “aware of the allegations” and are working to “take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.”\nJ. Allen Brack, the head of Blizzard Entertainment, stepped down from his position on Tuesday, with Jen ONeal and Mike Ybarra taking his place as co-leaders. Jesse Meschuk, SVP and senior people officer at Activision-Blizzard, also reportedly left the company this week. Activision-Blizzard employees have been organizing in the face of the company’s response to the lawsuit, including 2,600 signatures on an open letter from past and present employees, and a staged a walkout at Blizzard’s California office and online.\nPolygon has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment and will update this post should we receive new information.",

The roadmap features a wide variety of content like a new Gulag for Warzone, new maps and modes for multiplayer, new weapons, and a host of updates for Zombies.\nThe star of season 5 looks to be the new Double Agent mode, which gives off serious Among Us vibes. Players will need to complete their various tasks while the secretly selected, titular double agents will need to sabotage the match. The investigator player will need to put the clues together to help the rest of the operatives survive.\nImage: Treyarch/Activision\n  \nMultiplayer also sees the return of the Demolition game mode. Season 5 will feature five maps as part of its multiplayer update, including some players have seen before: Echelon, Slums, Showroom, Drive-In, and Zoo. \nWarzone will get some new features as well. Players can play the new Clash game mode, which features Quad squads battling it out deathmatch-style. New points of interest, including Broadcast Stations, will appear around the map as well, and the Gulag is getting a makeover. Warzone will also see two new perks with Tempered and Combat Scout.\nThe Zombies mode will see a major update with season 5. Players will get their hands on a grapple gun, a tank, and a new region called Collateral. Players can also check out a new game mode called Transport. The update includes a new perk, Death Perception, and a new field upgrade called Tesla Storm.\nFinally, season 5 will add five new weapons: the EM2 assault rifle, the TEC-9 SMG, a new handgun called the Marshall, a cane, and a new scorestreak that comes in the shape of a flamethrower. As always, season 5 will add a variety of operators, a new battle pass, and a mid-season event. \nSeason 5 starts Aug. 12.",

The mode is called Double Agent and it’s based on some Among Us-style deception, as shown in the trailer released on Thursday. \nDouble Agent will feature 10 players, who are each assigned a random role. The most important players are the double agents, who are tasked with either eliminating their fellow players or planting and detonating bombs across the map. Most players will play as Operatives, who have to discover the double agents and keep themselves alive. Finally, there’s the Investigator, who will get special clues to help them determine the double agents and can put out Wanted Orders on players they suspect have betrayed their allies. \nThe mode will feature a variety of extra features, including weapons that players can collect throughout the early stages of a match, and certain extra tools for the double agents, to help give them a leg up on their targets. The mode will also heavily use voice chat to help players identify who among them seems the most suspicious. \nDouble Agent will be part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s season 5 update, which is set to be released on Aug. 12.",

This update will roll out free to those who already own Art of Rally on PC, and be included in the new console versions at their launch on Aug. 12.\nFunselektor said back in May that it expects a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5 release this summer also, but it does not yet have a launch date to share.\nThe Kenya Update adds four new cars, two new songs, six more stages with locations referencing Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, a free-roaming map set in the Kenya environment, and even local wildlife. Zebras, giraffes, and elephants will highlight the wide-open savanna.\nArt of Rally launched Sept. 23, 2020 on Windows PC and MacOs via Steam.

Art of Rally’s cars are all fictitious, but they’re very well done homages to the recognizable chassis of their times. (My favorite is the German-engineered Das Whip.)",

The game was previously scheduled to launch at the end of August, but the new release date is Sept. 28, 2021. \nThis is the most recent of multiple delays for the game. “We know that this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer,” the developers said. “But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.” The team cited feedback from the closed beta as a factor in pushing back the game. \nYou can read the full statement on New World’s Twitter page here.\nA message from the New World team. pic.twitter.com/oAZdK7dxTn\n— New World (@playnewworld) August 4, 2021\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned delays started in April, where the studio cited problems created by the coronavirus lockdowns. In July 2020, the studio announced that the game would be delayed to spring 2021. Then, in February 2021, the studio delayed it once more to August, 2021. The original target date was May, 2020. \nNew World is an MMO where you’re tasked with colonizing a fictional landmass in the Atlantic. The game features 50-on-50 fights where entire groups clash to take the land. Amazon previously hosted a preview event with thousands of players to gather feedback. Then, it became a chaotic attempt to simulate mid-1600s war. \nNew World is one of three PC games announced by Amazon Game Studios at TwitchCon 2016. However, delays and cancellations have impacted all three titles. Their multiplayer brawler Breakaway was canceled during development. Their other title, Crucible launched in May 2020, only for the studio to un-release the game and bring it back into a closed beta. The team later ceased development of Crucible in October.",

These missions can be acquired from open world contacts, and sometimes they can go peacefully, but other times cowboys might need to apply a little bit of violence.\nFinally, a new game mode will launch on Aug. 10 called Call to Arms, in which players protect local townsfolk by fighting off waves of enemies. It will launch alongside a smaller season pass, the Quick Draw Pass, which grants players rewards as they level up.",

Now, creator Will Brierly has a new concept: Beach volleyball, but with naked old men. It’s Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League, created in collaboration with illustrator Rachel Olson and Aaron Bleyaert, the host of Conan O’Brien’s Clueless Gamer series.\nRetired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is, essentially, what is says on the tin. You’ll play as Len, an older gentleman enrolled in a nude beach volleyball league specifically for older gentlemen. The game is, largely speaking, volleyball, played with a nude ref who sometimes makes bad calls. There’s a story underneath it all, though, told through dialogue that continues throughout the game. \nBrierly said he hopes it makes players want to hug their grandparents or anyone else they love. At the very least, the game has a very catchy song.\nRetired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is available Tuesday as a bonus game in Humble Choice, the monthly games service from Humble Bundle. Humble Choice gives subscribers 12 PC games every month for $9. On Friday, it’ll be added to Humble Trove — the library of games available to Humble Choice subscribers.",

A new update adds a new car, two new tracks, and streets filled with zombies (and zombie cows) to plow through. Wreckfest’s latest tournament borrows its visuals from the original Carmageddon, a pixelated mess by modern standards, which gives it a sense of charm.\nWreckfest players will be able to race through two vintage Carmageddon tracks (Bleak City and Death Canyon) and ride in the sawblade-adorned Eagle R car, which appeared in 2016’s Carmageddon: Max Damage.\nThe action is certainly less sadistic than the original Carmageddon, which awarded players bonus points for running over innocent pedestrians. Wreckfest’s version of vehicular homicide is more about cleaning up the streets of undead, with palatable splashes of green, pixelated blood splashing across the screen.\nWreckfest is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. We called its brand of destruction-filled racing some of the most fun we had in 2019. The Carmageddon series kicked off in 1997, with Stainless Games’ original game for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows PC.

Monday’s announcement said Containment is “inspired by the upcoming game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction,” which was re-titled from Rainbow Six Quarantine during an E3 2021 reveal in June.\nContainment will take place on a reworked version of the Consulate map. In-game, the building is overrun by the Chimera parasite, whose outbreak forms the narrative context of Extraction. It was also the basis of Operation Chimera, an expansion for Siege that launched in 2018, which introduced a cooperative event called Outbreak.\nContainment’s new playlist is called Nest Destruction. Players will get a look at REACT, the faction that will be doing most of the cleanup in Extraction. In Nest Destruction, the Attackers are REACT agents (a news release in July said Rainbow operators Ash, Mira, and Thermite formed this squad). The Defenders are alien shapeshifters who look like REACT teammates, but can only use melee attacks. Attackers are there to destroy the nest, Defenders are there to destroy the Attackers.\nContainment will offer 33 unique items, including uniforms and weapon skins, for operators IQ, Ace, Blackbeard, Amaru, Zero, Aruni, Jager, Kaid, Mira, and Warden. These items are available in Siege’s shop for 1680 R6 credits, or in Containment Packs that run 300 R6 credits or 12,500 renown.\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally expected to launch Sept. 16, but in mid-July, Ubisoft announced it was postponing that release until January 2022. Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions on Amazon Luna and Google Stadia.",

The cat-centric gameplay looks impressively authentic; as the titular stray cat, you’ll knock things over to solve puzzles and create new pathways, leap through a strange city with feline grace, and claw up furniture because you despise humans’ material investments.\nMost of what you’ll do in Stray draws upon the real-world abilities of a cat. But you also have a helpful companion, a drone named B-12, who offers other gifts. B-12 will helpfully interact with objects in the world and communicate with the city’s robotic inhabitants. The cat will also have to avoid danger from rat-like creatures, but with the help of B-12, it appears the cat can turn the tables and kill them en masse with a purple light.\nThe cat can also very believably lick its butt, as seen in the GIF below.\nStray is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC sometime in early 2022.",

The developer promises fluid controls, with rail-grinding, grappling, and cloud surfing. \n“Solar Ash is Heart Machine’s vision of the adventure platformer,” game designer Alx Preston said of Solar Ash earlier this year. “The giant spaces, the feel of movement, the flow of combat, and the high stakes battles atop enormous beasts all come together to bring players something we think is incredibly unique, and more importantly, fun.”\nIn our review of the developer’s Hyper Light Drifter, we praised the top-down action game for its combination of story and gameplay: “It replaces traditional narrative structures with moods, but punctuates those contemplative, quiet moments with constant scenes of breakneck, pitch-perfect action. Getting those two elements to not only coexist but thrive together is a needle that Hyper Light Drifter confidently threads.”",

The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.\nIt started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. \nSome held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. \nAs it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.\nPolygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.",

In a pair of demos, which The Coalition made clear “do not represent a game product,” we get a peek at ultra-realistic character rendering and two major new features of Unreal Engine 5: Lumen and Nanite.\nThe character rendering demo shows a human male character rendered in extreme detail: His body is composed of 130,000 triangles, with another 31,000 dedicated to his face alone. His hair, beard, and eyebrows eat up another 3.5 million.\nIn another demo, The Coalition showcases the real-time lighting and reflection technology, called Lumen, in Unreal Engine 5, and Nanite, “which allows for unlimited triangle budget.” Epic Games announced those UE5 features in May 2020, as part of a showcase of the game engine running on PlayStation 5 hardware, but here’s another sun-baked, particle-rich, and glowing-mirrored-obelisk look at the graphics tech in action:\n\n\nThe Coalition announced in May that it was winding down development on Gears of War 5, and shifting to new, unannounced projects using Unreal Engine 5. The Coalition said it will be developing with UE5 “for multiple new projects in the coming years.”\nEpic announced Unreal Engine 5 last year, and made the technology available in preview form in early 2021. A full release is slated for late 2021. Unreal Engine 5 will be available for both current-generation and last-generation consoles, as well as Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows PC. UE5 is being developed with forward compatibility in mind, Epic says, letting developers create games in Unreal Engine 4 and move them to the next-generation engine later.\nFor a full look at The Coalition’s Unreal Engine 5 tech demos, check out the developer’s hourlong GDC 2021 presentation on YouTube.",

Respawn Entertainment released a trailer on Monday to show off the newly destroyed version of the map along with some of the other features of the Apex Legends season 10: Emergence, including Seer, the game’s new Legend, and the new Rampage weapon.\nWorld’s Edge was already filled with the lava and all sorts of other hazards, but the new “decimated” version of the map seems to make it more treacherous than ever. Lava is expanding into new parts of the map, as buildings and terrain are destroyed by some kind of calamity. In one of the earlier trailers, there’s even an avalanche of some kind for players to outrun. The trailer only gives quick glimpses of areas of the map, but it seems like large portions will be totally changed when the new season is released. \nThe new map update isn’t the only change that Respawn is bringing with season 10 either. Seer already seems like one of the game’s most exciting Legends and he gets another spotlight in this trailer. We see him shooting down enemies as well as tracking them with his various nanotech abilities, including his Ultimate, which places a dome over a small area of the map and tracks anyone moving quickly inside. \nThe Emergence update will also include a new weapon called Rampage, which seems to be a slow-firing but very powerful rifle. Of course, there will also be a battle pass to go along with the new season that includes character and weapon skins for players to unlock as they play. \nApex Legends season 10 and all of its additions are set to go live on Aug. 3.",

Wayfinder is described as an “art game” by creator Matt DesLauriers, an approachable browser game that makes poetry as easy as exploring a procedurally generated world.\nIt’s fitting then, that Wayfinder is a game starring a mysterious character, dressed like an otherworldly magician, working their art in a gorgeously illustrated world.

It’s pitched as a “high-octane,” 6v6 multiplayer first-person arena shooter — it’s “fast-paced firefights meets punk-rock moshpit,” said XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin and creative director Jason Schroeder in a reveal video.\nDeveloped by Ubisoft San Francisco, Tom Clancy’s XDefiant promises realistic gunplay with personalized classes, represented as factions with special abilities. Those factions (Echelon, Outcasts, Cleaners, and Wolves) are inspired by other Tom Clancy games, like the Splinter Cell, The Division, and Ghost Recon series.\nOn top of deep personalization and customization, gunplay is a “top priority,” Rubin said. XDefiant will feature “an ever-growing arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments,” Rubin explained, boasting that Ubisoft San Francisco is crafting “every weapon attachment for precise, satisfying gunplay.”\nAn early gameplay test for Tom Clancy’s XDefiant will launch Aug. 5. Interested players can register at the game’s official website. The game is still early in development, its creators said, adding that “your feedback is essential to make this game great.” Schroeder said that Ubisoft plans to add to the game’s “diverse cast” with new characters, and Rubin said that Ubi SF is “committed to creating a welcoming game based on fair play and transparency.”\nTom Clancy’s XDefiant is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions for Amazon Luna and Google Stadia. Ubisoft promises cross-platform play. XDefiant was previously outed as Battlecat, back in June.",

The latest of Apex’s always-excellent Stories from the Outlands cinematics tells the tale of Seer, a child with cursed, glowing eyes, and the next Legend to join the Apex Games.\nAccording to the trailer, Seer’s eyes are more than just a piercing blue: They’re also so special they can reduce kings to beggars and oceans to deserts, whatever that means in the context of a battle royale game. While it’s not totally clear what his abilities will be just yet, his description in the season preview on the Apex Legends website may offer some clues: \nWith microdrones and an artist’s eye, Seer spots opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seizes them in the most beautiful way he can.\n\nWhatever his powers are it seems that he’ll feature plenty of style and maybe even have a few unique, hat-themed skins — which is exciting, because Apex currently has a distinct lack of good hats. \nAnother change coming to Apex Legends in the new season, which is called Emergence, is the new Rampage light machine gun and the arrival of Ranked mode for Arenas.

The Zelda Zone was essentially a Sonic course that took inspiration from various Zelda games like Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword. (Sonic also got to visit the Yoshi Zone in a separate bit of DLC for Lost World.)\nThroughout the level, Sonic runs through recognizable Zelda locales like Hyrule Field and Death Mountain. Every now and then, we’ll see Link soaring overhead on a Loftwing. At one point, Sonic gets launched up into the air, and Link waves at him.\n\n\nThe level is just really dang cute. In addition to Sonic wearing Link’s iconic green tunic, it’s filled with other references. It swaps out Sonic’s golden rings for rupees. All the music is from Zelda. Also, Sonic can open chests and get new heart containers that expand his health bar. At the very end, Sonic finds a special surprise. You can check out a full playthrough of the level here. \nIt’s fun to see because, besides the occasional brawl, Link and Sonic don't get to meet each other all that much. Here, they both get to adventure through the big green world together.",

Grinding Gear Games will launch Path of Exile: Expedition on July 23.\nThe Expedition expansion adds a new activity where players bomb artifact sites for gear. Commissioned by the Kalguur, players will place traps along the ground to unearth loot and other artifacts. But these explosion also cause ancient Kalguur to rise from the grave and strike back. Players can also use explosives to blow through walls and find secrets, or pick up even better loot by unearthing treasure chests.\nOnce players have the artifacts, they can then haggle with the Kalguur for more loot. Players will need to balance getting a deal with not pissing of the NPC they’re trading with.\nGrinding Gear Games is also making a lot of big changes with Expedition. Players will gain access to 19 new Skill and Support Gems. This will give players more ways to build their characters, even outside of the new Expedition mode. The studio will also rework the game’s Flask system, which previously forced players to slam their fingers on keys repeatedly.

Stockholm-based Fatshark said, in a familiar refrain, that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted its original plan to deliver Darktide later this year.\nMarin Wahlund, founder and CEO of Fatshark, announced the delay on social media, explaining, “We have a responsibility to deliver the best game we possibly can, and frankly we need more time to accomplish this goal.

As you can probably guess from the title, this update is all about the “Auto” part of Grand Theft Auto.\nPlayers who are into the social side of the game can go to the LS Car Meet, a new space for underground street racers. This is a venue where car aficionados can go without dealing with the chaos of a public server, a safe place where you can simply show off your stylish ride. There’s a test track that allows you to give your friend’s car a spin, and you can demo the game’s newest cars as well.\nThe LS Car Meet comes with new races, too. Some of them take place at the Car Meet, while others use the streets of Los Santos on a track. Of course, an update like this also wouldn’t be complete without new cars. These vehicles are designed to be highly customizable, and is scheduled to be released in two waves, so players can mix and match to create the perfect ride.\nThere are also illegal elements to the new arena, of course. Getaway drivers and fearless stunt riders will be able to pick up jobs that need a good, solid wheelman. For GTA$50,000, players can sign up to become a member, which unlocks a new progression track called Reputation. Level up your Reputation, and you can get new benefits and rewards, like unique tattoos and merch.\nTen new cars will drop on July 20, with an additional seven dropping over the rest of the summer. When GTA Online launches for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, some of these vehicles will be eligible for special improvements — only for people who are playing on those consoles, which will give them a nice edge.\nPlayers can expect more content this summer.

          "description": "Image: Bandai Namco\n    \n\n  \nFree-to-play FPS Gundam Evolution is coming to PC  \n Gundam Evolution is a new first-person shooter set in the world of Mobile Suit Gundam. Two teams of six players square off in arenas where they fight to capture points using special abilities — and the occasional ultimate ability — as famous mobile suits. And yeah, after watching the debut trailer for Gundam Evolution, this really does look like Overwatch.\nIt’s not just the game structure; Gundam Evolution follows the hero-shooter formula for sure. It’s also the interface, which is nearly identical to Blizzard’s UI for Overwatch (and Overwatch 2). That’s excusable — it’s a clean, easy-to-parse interface. The good stuff is blue, the bad stuff is red, and I know exactly where to look to check my cooldowns and ultimate ability meter.\nGundam Evolution will have three game modes, according to its official website: Point Capture, in which teams fight for control over spots on the map; Domination, where teams vie to capture one of three randomly available points; and Destruction, where one team is tasked with destroying an object while the other attempts to protect it. So far, there is no payload-delivery mode ... perhaps a smart admission that no one ever wants to be on the payload.\nPublisher Bandai Namco says Gundam Evolution will be free to play when it’s released on Windows PC. A Japanese release is confirmed, but there’s no word yet on a Western localization.\nIt’s a big week for Gundam games. Bandai Namco announced Wednesday that Super Robot Wars 30, the mecha anime mashup role-playing game series, is headed to the West, featuring giant mechs and robots from Mobile Suit Gundam, Mazinger, Getter Robo, SSSS.Gridman, and other series.",

There’s just one problem: two of them are Thralls, and they want to make sure everyone dies in the icy coldness. That’s bad! The explorers have to work as a team, repairing their ship and pushing forward through the harsh climate before they are eliminated by sneaky Thralls. There’s also voice chat built in, which adds a fun role-play element — it’s like getting to star in The Terror.\nThralls also have more tools to sabotage the expedition than your average impostor. They can poison food, detonate explosives on the ship, and even cast dark rituals. There are also external threats, like wolves and cannibals. Don’t worry though. If things get too grim, you can absolutely eat your fellow explorers for a quick pick me up.\nThe newest update is called The Great Hunt, and it brings a new map called the Summit, a deadly polar bear, and a character called the Hunter who uses a bow.",

Players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms will also be able to play against each other, but given the maximum player-count difference (64 players vs. 128 players) between last-gen and current-gen consoles, cross-generation play will not be included in this year’s Battlefield.\nIn a blog post, DICE also confirmed that players on PC and consoles can opt out of playing against each other, addressing concerns about skill differences between mouse and keyboard and gamepad players.\nDICE says it will test out cross-play functionality during Battlefield 2042’s technical play test, which was scheduled to go live sometime in July, but has since been delayed to “later this summer.”\nPlayers who expect to play across multiple platforms also got some good news today: DICE says it’s building cross-progression and cross-commerce for Battlefield 2042, which will be shared across all platforms. “Your unlocked progress and purchases in your PlayStation copy of the game will carry over onto the Xbox or PC version, and vice versa,” DICE said.\nMore details about Battlefield 2042’s gameplay changes are available at the game’s official website.\nBattlefield 2042 was unveiled in June, promising massive maps for up to 128 players, real-time destructive weather, and near-future weapons of war.

          "description": "In a paper published in 2017, Todd Kashdan and his colleagues identified five distinct dimensions of curiosity. Here are the first three:\n1. Joyous Exploration. This is the prototype of curiosity — the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.\n2. Deprivation Sensitivity. This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.\n3. Stress Tolerance. This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.\n\n\nThey also identified four types of curious people: The Fascinated, Problem Solvers, Empathizers, and Avoiders.

For instance, Wes Anderson made Bottle Rocket for $5 million, Rushmore for $10 million, and Grand Budapest Hotel for $25 million:\n\nSteven Spielberg shot Duel for $450,000, Raiders of the Lost Ark for $20 million, and Saving Private Ryan for $70 million:\n\nChristopher Nolan did Following for $6,000, Memento for $9 million, and Inception for $160 million:\n\nYou can find the full playlist of 3 Budget Levels videos here.

          "description": "In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.\nCognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.\nThe power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.\n\n\nI particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:\nDaily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.\n\n\nFor more information on how caffeine enabled the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, check out Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses.\nTags: books   drugs   Michael Pollan   This Is Your Mind on Plants",

It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.\nAnton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.\nSteven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.\n\n\n Tags: Tim Harford",

Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. \nIt is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.\n\n\nKurzgesagt founder Philipp Dettmer is publishing a companion book to the series, Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive; it’s out in late September.\nI have read a lot about the human immune system over the past 18 months, but this video was still helpful in understanding how it all fits together.

For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.\n“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”\n\n\nArmanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:\nThose distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”\n\n\n(thx, pete)\nTags: 2020 Summer Olympics   Lizzie Armanto   Nathan Fitch   Olympic Games   skateboarding   sports   video",

They had not intended to open the border up completely.\nThe changes were meant to be fairly minor — but the way they were delivered had major consequences.\nNotes about the new rules were handed to a spokesman, Günter Schabowski — who had no time to read them before his regular press conference. When he read the note aloud for the first time, reporters were stunned.\n“Private travel outside the country can now be applied for without prerequisites,” he said. Surprised journalists clamoured for more details.\nShuffling through his notes, Mr Schabowski said that as far as he was aware, it was effective immediately.\nIn fact it had been planned to start the next day, with details on applying for a visa.\nBut the news was all over television — and East Germans flocked to the border in huge numbers.\n\n\nHow did the Berlin Wall fall? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\nTags: Berlin Wall   Cold War   Germany   politics   video",

The canoe is usually leaned over to the side to help the boat turn sharply and efficiently and paddle strokes are taken on either side of the canoe depending on the individual move. Balance, paddle placement and turn initiation are a few keys to this control. Since the movements seem dance-like, some practice this art timed to music, which is the ultimate in control.\n\n\nThe vest & bow tie, the choice of music (The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh), his control of the canoe — it’s all perfect.\nSee also It’s Reflective Fjord Season, Watch As a Master Woodworker Turns a Giant Log into an Elegant Dugout Canoe, and Kayaking Down a Drainage Ditch.

The ladles pour the molten metal into these molds. Once the metal is poured and cooled, the sand molds get placed into a shake-out machine that shakes the sand away from the pan, and then into an enormous drum to shake off the rest. The pans are finally put on a giant conveyor belt to be sorted and inspected. Any pans that are not up to muster get thrown back into the original scrap heap to be melted down again and remade into another pan.\n\n\nIn comparison, here’s how Borough Furnace makes their cast iron pans by hand in their much smaller workshop:\n\nVery similar process, down to the sand molds, just on a much smaller and more hands-on scale.\nTags: cooking   how to   video",

Playing in the 1970s, before the enforcement of Title IX in athletics, the 6’3” Harris dominated in high school, led a small university to three consecutive national basketball championships in the first 5 years of the program (while averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds per game), scored the first basket in Olympics women’s basketball history, is the only woman ever officially drafted by an NBA team, and was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. And those aren’t even her proudest achievements — you’ll have to watch the video for that.\nFor an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals — but Harris’s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot’s “The Queen of Basketball,” Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.\n\n\nThis video is part of the NY Times’ Almost Famous series, which also includes stories about radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell and actress/singer Kim Hill.\nTags: basketball   Ben Proudfoot   Lusia Harris   sports   video",

The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.\n\n\nYou can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.\nTags: Lora Webb Nichols   photography",

The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:\nThis was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.\n\n\nAfter more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now. When the rest of the world is teeming with the virus, it becomes more likely over time that even the most organized and protected systems are going to be vulnerable.\nTags: Covid-19   Ed Ou   Taiwan   video",

Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.\nAs someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.\nTags: TikTok   video",

In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.\nIn 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.\nIt’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.\nTags: Antony Hewish   astronomy   Ben Proudfoot   Jocelyn Bell Burnell   Nobel Prize   physics   science   sexism",

Domino’s filled in potholes. Dawn’s dish soap saved ducks. American Express pitched in on historic preservation. Walmart started selling low-priced insulin. A slew of companies help workers pay for school. Much of America’s health care system is still handled through private insurers and your job. As people lose faith in government to act on sweeping issues such as climate change and guns, they’re increasingly looking to corporate America and asking whether there’s something they can do about it. If Congress won’t tackle gun violence, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods can try.\nIt’s not a bad thing for brands and companies to try to make the world better. Starting a business often involves identifying a problem to solve, and it’s much better for companies to help than to do harm. Corporate social responsibility is fine. There are, however, limits.\n“Of course we want businesses to be responsible,” said Suzanne Kahn, managing director of research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. But she emphasized that this does not constitute a plan for how to organize society. “Private companies don’t, can’t, or won’t plan with the same values that we demand and expect the government to.”\n\n\n(via the morning news)\nTags: business   Emily Stewart   USA",

A man in an orange vest places a “Stand Here for Dance Party” sign on the ground and then walks away. A brave soul steps onto the sign and, well, you might guess what happens next.\nI found this via Rob Walker’s newsletter about his book, The Art of Noticing. I love what he wrote about it:\nNow that you’ve seen it, you know that once someone did stand on the decal, a squad of Improv Everywhere operatives, with boom boxes and impressive dance moves, converted the public space into (as promised) an open-air dance party. Very fun.\nBut here’s what makes this work: Not just the planning and the expert performers and the slick choreography and the clever subversion of social-distance design. None of that matters unless somebody stands on the decal. What activates this entire operation is curiosity.\n\n\nHe continues, describing the woman who gets the party started:\nThis woman is my hero! I love everything about her, her body language, her openness, the thrilling sense she radiates that anything could happen and she’s up for it. And if you’ve watched the video, you know that she in fact unleashed an experience that she (and many strangers nearby) will never forget.\nWhat’s not in the video, but we know is true, is some huge majority of people not even noticing, or actively ignoring, the invitation to an impromptu, on-the-spot dance party. As always, attention is the first step.\n\n\nCuriosity. Attention. There are those words again, the universe trying to tell me something.\nTags: dance   Improv Everywhere   NYC   Rob Walker   video",

So he wrote an article about what his impending death means.\nAs the saying goes, fate has dealt me one from the bottom of the deck, and I am now condemned to confront the question that has plagued me for years: How does a person spend what he knows are his final months of life?\nAtop the list of things I’ll miss are the smiles and hugs every morning from my beautiful wife, Geraldine, the greatest blessing of my life. I hate the notion of an eternity without hearing laughter from my three children. And what about my 40 rose bushes? Who will nurture them? I cannot imagine an afterlife without the red of my America roses or the aroma of my yellow Julia Childs.\nWe told each of the three children individually. John Patrick put his face in his hands, racked with sobs. After hanging up the telephone, Jennifer doubled over and wept until her dog, Rosie, approached to lick away the tears but not the melancholy. Faith explained over the telephone that, if I could see her, she was weeping and wondering how she could get along without her dad. Now, she is on the Internet every day, snorkeling for new research, new strategies, new medications. My wife cries every morning, then rolls up her sleeves and handles all doctor appointments and medication. Without her… I cannot imagine.\n\n\n(via nextdraft)\nTags: death   Jack Thomas",

And even space itself was once brimming with sound. \nThis short film takes you on a journey back in time and to the edge of our solar system and beyond, to discover what other worlds of sound are lurking beyond Earth’s atmosphere. You won’t believe your ears :)\n\n\nThis is really well done, which isn’t surprising considering Boswell did the excellent Timelapse of the Future video a few years back.

          "description": "This piece by Wright Thompson on how the murder of Emmett Till has been remembered and forgotten is a difficult, compelling, and important read. The story centers around the still-little-known barn where Till was tortured and murdered by a group of several white men in 1955.\nBut the way Till’s name exists in the firmament of American history stands in opposition to the gaps in what we know about his killing. No one knows, for instance, how many people were involved. Most historians think at least seven were present. Only two were tried: half brothers J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Another half brother, Leslie Milam, was there that night too. He lived in an old white farmhouse a few dozen steps from the barn, next to where Jeff Andrews’s house now stands.\nIn 1955 an all-white, all-male jury, encouraged by the defense to do their duty as “Anglo-Saxons,” acquitted J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Because the defendants couldn’t be tried again, they got paid to make a confession to a national magazine — a heavily fictionalized account stage-managed by their lawyers — and Leslie Milam and his barn were written out of the story. Ask most people where Till died and they’ll say Money, Mississippi, the town where Till whistled at Bryant’s wife outside the family’s store. An Equal Justice Initiative monument in Montgomery says Money. Wikipedia does too. The Library of Congress website skips over the barn, which is just outside the town of Drew, about 45 minutes from the store.\nI learned about the barn last year and have since made repeated visits, alone and with groups, once with members of Till’s family. Over and over, I drove from my home in the Mississippi hill country back into the gothic flatland where I was born. The barn’s existence conjures a complex set of reactions: It is a mourning bench for Black Americans, an unwelcome mirror for white Americans. It both repels and demands attention.\n\n\n Tags: crime   Emmett Till   murder   racism   USA   Wright Thompson",

So unhappy. Fire season was not only already here, I said, but it was going to go on for at least four more months, and I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself. I didn’t know how I would stand the anxiety. I told her I felt like all I did every day was try to act normal while watching the world end, watching the lake recede from the shore, and the river film over, under the sun, an enormous and steady weight.\nThere’s only one thing I have to say about climate change, I said, and that’s that I want it to rain, a lot, but it’s not going to rain a lot, and since that’s the only thing I have to say and it’s not going to happen, I don’t have anything to say.\n\n\nMiller continued:\nAlso, for what? Let’s give the article (the one she was starting to maybe think about asking me to write that I was wondering if I could write) the absolute biggest benefit of the doubt and imagine that people read it and said, “Wow, this is exactly how I feel, thanks for putting it into words.”\nWhat then? What would happen then? Would people be “more aware” about climate change? It’s 109 degrees in Portland right now. It’s been over 130 degrees in Baghdad several times. What kind of awareness quotient are we looking for? What more about climate change does anyone need to know?

I have to really understand what I’m doing and then I think through almost every possibility and eventuality, like a mind map on steroids. And I plan. When people say things like: “Who could have imagined XYZ would happen?” about some entirely predictable outcome, my most common response is “I could”. I have realised that for most people I am an overthinker, but for me, it is others who underthink. I just think.\n\n\nI have taken my foot off the overthinking pedal in recent years, but that paragraph more or less describes me to a T. My anxiety and overthinking used to feel like a handicap, like something to be overcome, but Oliver Burkeman’s persuasive argument in The Antidote convinced me to think about my anxiety as useful and even a little bit of a superpower, as long as it doesn’t spiral out of control.\nTags: Annalisa Barbieri",

          "description": "This piece by Susan Matthews is really helpful for those of us who are vaccinated and trying to figure out what their risks are regarding the much more transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is endemic now — how do we live with that? What reasonable actions should we take to keep ourselves, our communities, and our loved ones safe?\nAll of this is making people — yes, probably mostly vaccinated people — rethink the basic questions they thought their vaccine had answered for them: Can I go to restaurants and bars unmasked? Can I go back to the office? Can I see my grandma? Can I go on vacation? Can I unmask at my people-facing job? Can I have a wedding, or a party? The answer to those questions is not quite as easy as “yes, if you’re vaccinated.” It depends partly on how many in your group are vaccinated, but the actual answer is basically the same as it’s been all pandemic: It depends on your risk tolerance, it depends on what is happening with case counts locally (though, as more people travel, this might become a less reliable tool), and it depends on any unique risk factors in your group. Kass’ perspective felt novel to me: She said she suspects that in the end, a lot of people are going to end up boosting their immunity by suffering through a mild case of COVID. So no one should feel that bad about getting sick after they’re vaxxed. What matters is getting the order right: “If everyone who gets vaccinated still gets COVID but doesn’t die, that’s a success,” she said. The issue is that it doesn’t feel like a success for vaccinated people. Plus, “if you get infected after you’re vaxxed, it’s all you talk about,” she said. And right now, that’s understandably freaking out a lot of vaccinated people who thought they were in the clear.\n\n\nLong Covid isn’t mentioned anywhere in here though — surely that has to be part of the conversation here (although anecdotally it doesn’t seem like too much of a worry).\nTags: Covid-19   medicine   science   Susan Matthews",

They cry. And they tell me they didn’t know. They thought it was a hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn’t get as sick. They thought it was ‘just the flu’. But they were wrong. And they wish they could go back.

After docking, Eagle was jettisoned and the three astronauts returned to Earth in Columbia. It was presumed that Eagle orbited the Moon until eventually crashing into the surface, but a recent analysis shows that the spacecraft may have entered a stable orbit and is still circling the Moon decades after the end of the mission, a priceless artifact of an historic achievement.\nMost spacecraft in lunar orbit suffer from instability in their orbits due to the ‘lumpy’ nature of the lunar gravity which tends to cause the orbits to eventually get so elliptical that they hit the moon.\nHowever, an amateur space fan wanted to narrow down the possible impact location and used orbit modelling software to propagate the orbit forwards in time until it hit the moon. He was surprised to find that it didn’t hit the moon, and remained in a stable orbit for decades, this suggests that the Eagle may still be orbiting the moon over 5 decades after being left there.\n\n\nThe paper detailing the analysis suggests that if Eagle has survived, it should be detectable by radar.\nTags: Apollo   Apollo 11   astronomy   space",

And like Hilma af Klint many were drawn to Theosophy, which opened a route towards a new world of spiritual reality, rather than merely depicting visual impressions of the world around them.\nHad she not kept her abstract work secret she would surely have held the accolade of producing the world’s first abstract paintings. Instead, Kandinsky’s paintings of 1911 would, until recently, come to be recognised as the first abstract works of art.\n\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: art   art school   Hilma af Klint   Paul Priestley   video",

          "description": "During a Tonight Show appearance in 1978, Johnny Carson asked Carl Sagan about the scientific accuracy of Star Wars. Sagan replied:\nThe 11-year-old in me loved them but they could have made a better effort to to do things right. A lot of different aspects of things — Star Wars starts out saying it’s on some other galaxy and then you see there’s people. Starting in scene one there’s a problem, because human beings are the result of a unique evolutionary sequence based upon so many individually unlikely random events on the Earth.\nIn fact, I think most evolutionary biologists would agree that if you started the Earth out again and just let those random factors operate you might wind up with beings that are as smart as us and as ethical and artistic and all the rest, but they would not be human beings. That’s for the Earth. So in another planet, different environment, very unlikely to have a human being. It’s extremely unlikely that there would be creatures as similar to us as as the dominant ones in Star Wars.\nAnd a whole bunch of other things: they’re all white. The skin of all the humans in Star Wars, oddly enough, is like this. And not even the other colors represented on the Earth at present, much less greens and blues and purples and oranges.\n\n\nCarson pushes back slightly at this point: “They did have the scene of Star Wars with a lot of strange characters.” But Sagan persists:\nYeah, but none of them seem to be in charge of the galaxy. Everybody in charge of the galaxy seemed to look like us. And I thought it was a large amount of human chauvinism.\n\n\nSagan also complained about Han Solo’s boast of doing the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. According to the script, this was an “obvious” lie on Han’s part to make his ship sound impressive, so Sagan missed that. But then, post-Lucas, the Kessel Run was explained in Solo: A Star Wars Story as a distance shortcut and not an elapsed completion time, so….

After closing one file and before opening another, she routinely checked her social-media feeds. Her expression, her posture, did not vary depending on the information she encountered there: a news report about a horrific natural disaster, a photograph of someone’s beloved pet, a female journalist speaking out about death threats, a recondite joke requiring familiarity with several other previous Internet jokes in order to be even vaguely comprehensible, a passionate condemnation of white supremacy, or a promoted tweet advertising a health supplement for expectant mothers. Nothing changed in her outward relationship to the world that would allow an observer to determine what she felt about what she saw. Then, after some length of time, with no apparent trigger, she closed the browser window and reopened the text editor. Occasionally one of her colleagues would interject with a work-related question and she would answer, or someone would share a funny anecdote with the office and they would all laugh, but mostly the work continued quietly.\n\n\nPer an interview with Rooney, the piece is excerpted from her next novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, due out in September and eagerly anticipated in this household.\nTags: Sally Rooney",

For instance, it takes 14.3 seconds to cover that distance on Earth and 13.8 seconds on Saturn.\nIt might be surprising to see large planets have a pull comparable to smaller ones at the surface, for example Uranus pulls the ball down slower than at Earth! Why? Because the low average density of Uranus puts the surface far away from the majority of the mass. Similarly, Mars is nearly twice the mass of Mercury, but you can see the surface gravity is actually the same… this indicates that Mercury is much denser than Mars.\n\n\n(via @thekidshouldsee)\nTags: astronomy   gravity   infoviz   physics   science   video",

          "description": "For more than 21 years, Noah Kalina has taken a photograph of himself. Periodically, he makes video compilations of the photos — you’ve probably seen them here or elsewhere. For his latest video, he’s collaborated with Michael Notter (visuals) and Paul O’Mara (sound) on a video called 7777 Days.\nIn a first step, Michael used the machine learning library dlib (http://dlib.net/) and some custom Python code to detected in each of Noah’s photos 5 face landmarks (i.e. both eyes, the nose and the two corners of the mouth). These landmarks were then used to align the faces in all photos, so that the eyes and corner of the mouth were horizontally oriented and always an equal distance apart. After that, some small image intensity correction were applied to make very dark images a bit brighter and very bright ones a bit darker. This was followed by an upscaling of all images (where needed) to a 4K resolution.\n\n\nThe result is a 2-minute video (reminiscent of Jason Salavon’s work) that spans half of Kalina’s life — in the video he ages 2 months every second and 10 years a minute.\nTags: mesmerizing   Michael Notter   Noah Kalina   Paul O’Mara   photography   video",

          "description": "Michael Buckley:\nmacOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.\nThis is the primary reason Retrobatch isn't sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I've considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can't bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.\nEvery year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.\nSee also this really old radar: rdar://13006144: Sandbox and limitation on number of files that can be opened from a user.",

At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.\nHe was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. \nSeeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.",

          "description": "Photo by Len Redkoles/NHLI via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nChuck Fletcher adds another depth piece.\n Continuing a very busy, yet simultaneously quiet free agency for the Flyers, the Orange & Black have signed former New York Ranger Adam Clendening to a one year, two-way deal, and if the other two-way deals signed today are any indication, his NHL salary will be something in the $700-$750k range. With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.\nClendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. \nPhiladelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.",

The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange & Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.\nThompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.\nWith this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.",

          "description": "Photo by Rocky W. Widner/NHL/Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nWell, there’s your backup goalie.\n After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.\nJones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.\nSince the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.\nThis article may be updated.",

The Flyers are on a roll here, and they’ve picked up a third defenseman in a row with their sixth round, 174th overall pick in Ethan Samson. \nA product of the Prince George Cougars of the WHL, Samson is a right shot defenseman with decent size (6’1”, 194 pounds). While the Flyers’ first two pickups of the day on defense brought a bit more of a dynamic offensive game, Samson falls more into the mold of a defensive-defenseman. He was able to get a bit of power play time this season on top of his even strength and penalty kill responsibilities, and was still able to bring a bit of scoring to the table, with 12 points in his 22 games played. So there is a bit of offensive upside there, but it’s really Samson’s defensive game that stands out. \nHe has a good motor and brings a nice bit of physicality. He anticipates plays well and brings a good defensive awareness, and we see that working well both in the defensive zone and at the blue line, as he works on breaking up entries. But he also still skates and passes well, so there is still a good bit of dynamic skill to his game, it’s not as though he’s just a one trick defensive pony, if you will. \nAnd the pipeline fills out further at defense!",

The draft is still happening, the picks are rolling in, and the Flyers have picked up another defenseman!\nWith their 158th overall pick, the Flyers have selected Ty Murchison from the US National Team Development Program. Murchison put up modest scoring numbers in his draft year, with three goals and two assists in 23 games played (USHL) and seven goals and eight assists in 48 games played (USDP). He brings good size (6’2”, 192 pounds), but could still stand to get a little stronger. And while there’s still some polishing that needs to go into his game, all told, there’s a lot to like. He’s a smooth skater, and strong passer, and can transition the puck well. He brings a quick shot that he can get through traffic well, and that’s made him particularly effective on the power play. His defensive game needs some polishing, but his instincts are generally good, and he’s able to make use of good stick work to break up plays. The fundamentals are good. \nAnd we have two fun facts!\nTy Murchison, just picked up by the Flyers is a converted inline player. Headed to Arizona State next season. Told us at the U18s that Aidan Hreschuk, picked by Carolina in the third round, was one of the players who helped him convert to ice.\n— Chris Peters (@chrismpeters) July 24, 2021\n\n\n\nHe also joins the likes of Cam York and Jack St. Ivany in the group of Flyers defense prospects from California, which is pretty neat!\nMurchison will kick off his collegiate career with an Arizona State University program that just seems to be on the rise.",

The Flyers lose a bit of the scoring game that they had with Voracek, but they gain a stronger play driver. Atkinson and Voracek are the same age, and while Atkinson is signed for four more years (one more than Voracek), his cap hit is just $5.875 million, so the Flyers do free up $2.375 million in cap space. \nAnd, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t also mention in the locker room implications of this move. There has been talk for a while about the mix with this Flyers team, in the locker room, not being right somehow, and the core being in need of a shake-up. And, well, moving out one of the team’s longest tenured players certainly achieves just that. \nWhat’s more, Atkinson was part of the leadership group in Columbus, and while it may not be fair to assume that he’ll immediately step into a similar role in Philadelphia, he remains a new voice with that leadership experience, and that hardly seems like a bad thing. \nIt’s been a busy offseason, to be sure, and next season’s new look Flyers are continuing to evolve.",

Not really. There may have been a bit of initial shock seeing Aube-Kubel on the protected list, but it’s a move that does make sense. A real emphasis for the Flyers this offseason, understandably, seems to be freeing up some cap space to have the flexibility to make some more moves, and this gives them the best chance of doing that. The Kraken no longer have the option of picking up Aube-Kubel because he’s cheap and has potential, but would have to pick up a player like van Riemsdyk, Voracek, or Gostisbehere who carry a higher cap hit. Granted, they could still go for Braun and add some good and lower cost depth, but this ensures that the Flyers have the greatest chance of seeing some money come off the books on Expansion Draft Day. \nThe Expansion Draft, of course, will take place on Wednesday July 21 at 8:00 ET, and we’ll see how Seattle decides to play this then.",

Well in.\n Fourteen years ago, also over the summer (in what would turn out to be a very busy offseason for the Flyers), a trade was made by the Flyers for a veteran Nashville Predators defenseman. For the shrewd price of only a first round pick (who would turn out to be Jonathon Blum, who only played 110 NHL games), the Flyers acquired a defenseman who would become a franchise icon, and who would help lead them all the way to multiple Eastern Conference Finals appearances, and even to a Stanley Cup Final. Of course, the player in question is Kimmo Timonen.\nThe Flyers will certainly be hoping that their newly acquired defenseman and another former Predator, Ryan Ellis, will have a similar if not greater impact on this ho…",
