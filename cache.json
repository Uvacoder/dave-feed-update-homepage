          "description": "In iOS 15, Apple has added a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera's viewfinder or in a photo you've taken and let you perform several actions with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if you take a picture of a storefront that displays a phone number, you can capture that number to place a call or add to your contacts. You can also copy Live Text from your photos for making use of elsewhere. It's an incredibly simple, useful feature, and here's how it works in its simplest form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nLaunch the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad.\n\r\n\r\nFind a photo that has some words on show, such as a restaurant menu or product tag.\n\r\n\r\nPinch to zoom the photo if the text appears small.\n\r\n\r\nPress and hold on the words, then drag the ends of the selection tool to highlight all the text that you want to copy.\n\r\n\r\nTake your finger off the screen, then select Copy from the contextual popup menu.\n\r\n\r\nFinally, switch to an app that supports text input, press and hold your finger where the cursor is located, then select Paste from the popup menu.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you know that Live Text also features optical character recognition? That means if you have a picture of a handwritten note in your photos, you can still copy it and then paste it as digital text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Photos also works with the camera app and other images on the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå, plus there are other features in addition to copy/paste including Look Up and Translate, so you can translate foreign language text found in a photo. Live Text works with the Spotlight search on the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå as well, which lets text in photos be located through a standard ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå search. \nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: Photos\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15: How to Copy and Paste Text From Photos\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The StudioCaddy is aimed at households that have multiple Apple products and want a single convenient place to keep them organized and charged up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\n\r\n\r\nDesign wise, the StudioCaddy is uncomplicated, with a streamlined look that fits in well with any decor. It's made from materials like plastic, aluminum, and a stitched fabric, and it feels like it has a durable build quality. The different pieces of the dock connect magnetically together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a Qi-based charging station for the iPhone and the ‚ÄåAirPods‚Äå, featuring a vertical Qi wireless charging spot for the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and a flat spot for the ‚ÄåAirPods‚Äå or AirPods Pro. Since this is just Qi, either of these spots can also be used for other devices too. For iOS devices, charging maxes out at 7.5W, but 10W charging is available for Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the side, there's a USB-C and and a USB-A port for charging additional devices, and you can use these with the laptop and tablet stand of the StudioCaddy. A MacBook or an iPad can fit into one of the StudioCaddy's storage slots, charging through the attached cables, which are sold separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tablet/laptop stand works with any size MacBook, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is convenient if you need an overnight storage spot. You can leave the StudioCaddy's pieces attached together magnetically or separate them out across your desk for a custom setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKensington is charging $179 for the StudioCaddy, which is expensive, but it is a solid multi-device charging station for those who need an all-in-one solution.

In addition to Cook and Zuckerberg, notable invitees included billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone, \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan, Dell CEO Michael Dell, and others. However, the report noted that not everyone on the guest list chooses to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being canceled last year due to the pandemic, the Sun Valley Conference returns this year with health and safety measures in place, with attendees required to present a negative PCR test result obtained within 72 hours prior to arrival, according to Vanity Fair. The report added that many presentations and events will take place outdoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook has attended the Sun Valley Conference multiple times, often alongside Apple's services chief Eddy Cue. While details are typically kept under wraps, it was recently reported that during a private meeting at the conference in 2019, Cook urged Zuckerberg to delete all user information Facebook had collected from third-party apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith so many media executives gathering in one place, the Sun Valley Conference likely provides Cook with an opportunity to negotiate Apple TV+ content deals.

More concerning perhaps is the inclusion of a vague section listing data that must be collected \"for legal enforcement, litigation, and authorities' requests (if any).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storage of said data is located in servers in the U.S., Russia, and the European Economic Area. For example, IP addresses are stored in an identifiable way for a day before being hashed and then stored in servers for a year, leaving users identifiable via government data requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the new policy prevents people under the age of 13 from using the software, which is a violation of the GPL license that Audacity uses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, the policy changes have upset Audacity users, who have taken to Reddit and GitHub to question why an offline desktop app needs to \"phone home\" at all, and there is already discussion about forking Audacity into a separate open-source project that's free from the Muse Group's ownership and questionable data collection practices.\nThis article, \"Audacity 'Spyware' Claims Follow Privacy Policy Changes By New Owner\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

That's the name of a feature the social media platform is testing that would allow users to limit the audience for specific content to a smaller circle of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on design concepts shared by the company (via TechCrunch), Trusted Friends could be a toggle that lets you indicate whether a tweet should be made public or be shown to just a handful of users. The idea is similar to Instagram's \"Close Friends\" feature, which lets users share personal Stories more privately. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing the option to Twitter would allow users who have multiple Twitter accounts separating their personal and professional lives to tweet from a single account and have greater control of who sees what on their timeline. It could also mean some users no longer have to toggle between public and protected tweets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter recently announced new ways for creators and influencers to deliver content to specific users who pay to access its \"Super Follow\" feature, and Trusted Friends feels like an experimental extension of the idea that would be available to all users. But it's just a concept for now, and there's no guarantee Twitter will ever take it live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther concepts Twitter says it is looking into include \"Facets,\" which would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all a user's tweets, or only those about the \"facet\" they're interested in, and an ability for users to list specific phrases that they don't want to see in replies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with Trusted Friends, neither of these features are currently in active development and Twitter is simply seeking feedback to gauge whether they're worth pursuing or not.\nTag: Twitter\nThis article, \"Twitter Considers Letting Users Tweet to 'Trusted Friends'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‚ÄåmacOS Monterey‚Äå beta and an M1 Mac is required.

When the pilot program launches, workers will move between their store and remote roles depending on demand in stores vs. online shopping at different times during the year. Salaries will remain constant regardless of where an employee is working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants in the Retail Flex program are being asked to participate for at least six months, with the initiative to ramp up from September to December when new devices are set to launch. Employees will be reimbursed for some internet expenses and will receive $100 to put toward office equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor corporate employees, Apple is implementing a work schedule that will see them returning to the office for three days a week starting in September. Some employees petitioned Apple for a more remote friendly work environment that would allow them to work from home permanently, but Apple's retail and people lead Deirdre O'Brien clarified that Apple's in-person work schedule is non-negotiable as in-person work is \"essential\" to Apple product development and company culture.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Stores\nTag: Apple retail\nRelated Forum: Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice\nThis article, \"Apple Developing Hybrid 'Retail Flex' Work From Home Program for Apple Store Employees\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In our experience, and based on other accounts from people who have tested the service, there's latency, sometimes bad and sometimes just sporadic. The lag doesn't make most games unplayable, but it does affect competitive online shooters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLatency can depend on connection, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming is fine if you have stellar internet speeds, but most reports so far suggest that it needs to be further refined for games where latency is a dealbreaker. We found we could adjust to the very slight delays for sports games and other titles, but with shooters, gameplay was hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the latency issues, we wouldn't recommend the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription strictly for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but if it's something that you already have, it's a great bonus feature. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate provides access to more than 100 games on Xbox, PCs, and mobile devices, plus same day release access to Xbox Game Studios titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can pay $1 to get three months of access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. After that three-month period, the subscription is priced at $14.99 per month.\nTags: Microsoft, Xbox\nThis article, \"Hands-On With Microsoft's Browser-Based Xbox Cloud Gaming Service on an iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today announced that it plans to hold its quarter three earnings call for the 2021 fiscal year on July 27, 2021. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the third quarter, which includes late March through late June, the company made several major announcements, including brand new iPad Pros, redesigned 24-inch iMac, AirTags, and a new Apple TV. Additionally, the company held its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where it announced major updates to all of its platforms coming to users this fall.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the second quarter, Apple recorded a March quarter record of $89.6 billion in revenue, while its Mac and Services business reached an all-time new high. As has been normal for the past year, Apple is not providing guidance for the June quarter given the instability fueled by the global health crisis. However, during the earnings call last quarter, Apple's CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects a \"sequential revenue decline\" for the June quarter.\r\n\r\nJune quarter revenues to grow strong double digits year over year, but we believe sequential revenue decline from March to June will be greater than prior years. First, due to later launch timing and strong demand, ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå only achieved supply/demand balance during the March quarter. Steeper sequential decline than usual. Supply constraints will have revenue impact of $3-4 billion.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern.

          "description": "Apple is continuing to struggle to meet demand for mini-LED displays in its recently launched 12.9-inch iPad Pro and displays in upcoming MacBook Pros, prompting the company to begin looking for extra suppliers in an attempt to ease the load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report slated to be published tomorrow, Apple is looking for suppliers beyond Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology, or TSMT, to assist in mounting electrical components onto circuit boards for the mini-LED display in the 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and upcoming MacBook Pros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigiTimes had previously reported that TSMT would remain the sole supplier of SMT (surface mounting technology) for the ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and the upcoming MacBook Pro. Since that report, however, Apple has seemed to change its outlook on the situation, potentially realizing that demand for the 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and expected demand for the upcoming MacBook Pro may exceed the capabilities of a single supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing its launch, Apple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå was rather limited in stock, with shipping times at the time of launch in April reaching mid and late July. Due to continued disruptions thanks to the global health crisis and global chip shortage, a similar scenario may be in practice with upcoming MacBook Pros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå was the first Apple product to feature the company's Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED, rather than traditional LCD or OLED.

As of mid-May, Apple was reportedly on track to spend around $300 million on Google cloud storage services this year, which would represent an increase of roughly 50% from all of 2020. Apple is said to be the largest corporate client for Google Cloud, dwarfing other high-profile customers like Spotify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud staffers have apparently even given Apple an internal code name that hints at its size as a customer: \"Bigfoot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple relies on a combination of its own data centers and third-party cloud storage services, such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, to store iCloud user data like photos and messages. Apple does not provide third-party cloud storage providers with the keys to decrypt user data stored on their servers, ensuring a strong level of security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report speculates that Apple's increased use of Google Cloud suggests the company's rising cloud storage requirements have outpaced its ability to develop and operate its own data centers needed to handle the resulting data.\nTags: Google, iCloud\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Storing Over 8 Million Terabytes of iCloud Data on Google Servers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "We're just a few months away from when Apple is expected to reveal the 2021 iPhone, dubbed the \"iPhone 13.\" In preparation for its launch, it has been pulling in shipments of different components needed to produce the new iPhones, according to a report from DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn years past, Apple released its latest ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, alongside a new Apple Watch, during a September event at Apple Park. Due to the global health crisis last year, the company was forced to delay the launch of the iPhone 12 to October, one month off its typical release schedule. Despite the delay last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones on time in September, according to well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple operates under dozens of suppliers based in China, the United States, Vietnam, and India to produce its devices. Lockdowns crippled many of Apple's supplier's ability to produce and assemble devices. TSMC, one of Apple's largest suppliers, has reportedly already started producing the A15 chip for the 2021 iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iPhone 12 featured several changes, such as an updated flat-edged design, the introduction of LiDAR for the high-end Pro models, and improved cameras. Above all, however, Apple's largest selling point for the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå was the inclusion of 5G technology. For the upcoming iPhones, Apple may instead focus on marketing other aspects of the device, including an all-new always-on display with 120Hz ProMotion technology, improved cameras, and more.

Apple and Asustek were tied for fifth place in IDC's rankings for computer brands in India in the quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a January earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that its India online store had received a \"tremendous\" response since opening, and that it had doubled Apple's smartphone share in the country to 4% in the December quarter. Cook said that as a result of the success, Apple was bringing forward plans to launch brick-and-mortar retail stores in the country. \nTags: digitimes.com, India\nThis article, \"Apple's Online Store in India Drives Significant Shipment Growth in Q1 2021\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

They're unlikely for next year‚Äîwith Apple's attention on a redesigned iPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022‚Äîand it's possible they never come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for many people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines between tablet and laptop.\nThe current iPad Pro comes in 11-inch and 12.9-inch display sizes. In a previous Bloomberg report, Gurman and Debby Wu said Apple is testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back that would support wireless charging for release in 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLarger display sizes would help further blur the lines between the iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro, which is available with up to a 16-inch display. However, many customers still believe iPadOS does not take full advantage of the iPad Pro's hardware, and Gurman opined that Apple ultimately needs to allow Mac apps and Mac-like multitasking with more flexible arrangements of app windows on the iPad Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last updated the iPad Pro in April with its custom-designed M1 chip, Thunderbolt support, 5G connectivity on cellular models, a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model, up to 2TB of storage, up to 16GB of RAM, and more. \nRelated Roundup: iPad Pro\nTag: Mark Gurman\nBuyer's Guide: 11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now), 12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Mark Gurman: Apple Exploring iPads With Larger Displays\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Starting with iOS and iPadOS 15 later this fall, hotspot connections from iPhones and iPads will be secured with the improved WPA3 security protocol, offering improved security and upgraded measures in place to prevent password guessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWPA3 was announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in June of 2018 with the goal to \"simplify Wi-Fi security, enable more robust authentication, and deliver increased cryptographic strength.\" On iOS 14, hotspot connections from an iPhone or iPad are secured only with WPA2, and now on updates coming later this fall, connections will be further protected with WPA3. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's products have been able to connect to networks with WPA3 security for several years, but until now, personal hotspot networks set up by those devices have only supported the older and weaker WPA2 standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the typical user, the hotspot connection experience on iOS 15 will remain the same; however, there are added benefits. Despite recommendations to create strong, complicated, and advanced passwords for hotspot connections, many users continue to use simple passwords that may be easily guessed. WPA3 specifically targets such use cases, as it uses \"more resilient, password-based authentication\" that offers \"stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS and ‚ÄåiPadOS 15‚Äå are currently being tested with developers, with a public beta being planned for later this summer.

Once that's done, it's just a simple matter of selecting it as your audio output destination on your iOS or Mac device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith ‚ÄåAirPlay‚Äå 2, you can use your newly connected speakers as part of a multi-room setup incorporating other speakers like HomePods, with audio output being synced across all speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntegration with the Home app also gives you the ability to incorporate your speakers into scenes and other automations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soundform Connect Audio Adapter with AirPlay 2 is priced at $99.99, so it's not exactly cheap, but if you got a nice sound system that lacks ‚ÄåAirPlay‚Äå support, this adapter can add some very useful functionality.\nTags: Belkin, AirPlay 2\nThis article, \"Video: Belkin's Soundform Connect Adds AirPlay 2 to Your Existing Speakers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Windows 11 will allow users to run Android apps, but the integration with Windows and iPhone is lacking. In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would \"love to make sure that it works better,\" referencing the iPhone and Windows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives revealed that at one point in time, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform \"would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage. \nTags: iMessage, Windows\nThis article, \"Microsoft CEO Would 'Welcome' Apple to Bring iMessage to Windows\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

One notable announcement was that, starting with Windows 11, PCs will be able to run Android apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogically, Microsoft would partner with the Google Play Store to offer Android apps on its platforms. However, the company is taking a different route, partnering with Amazon to open Windows 11 to Android apps. As reported by The Verge, users will search for an Android app offered through the Amazon app marketplace directly within the newly redesigned Microsoft App Store. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroid apps will run on the platform using Intel's \"bridge technology.\" Like traditional Windows apps, Android apps can be added to the new centered Windows taskbar, pinned, and snapped to different multitasking modes. Specific details remain unknown, such as hardware requirements and developers' need to make their Android apps runnable on Windows 11. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's announcement draws comparisons to Apple's announcement with macOS Big Sur last year and its transition to Apple silicon. Thanks to Apple silicon and the common architecture shared among Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, macOS can now run ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite Apple's best intentions, the experience of running iOS apps on Apple silicon Macs has been rough due to Mac's input being fully trackpad and keyboard-based, compared to the direct touch experience the apps were initially designed for.

Zompetti postulated that the \"two unusual pads are exposed to the band,\" and may be a kind of iPad-like \"Smart Connector,\" much like those from various iPad models, used to accommodate a \"Smart Band.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has filed a large number of patents around smart Apple Watch bands, indicating that it is something that the company has actively considered. Some patents showed how features such as biometric authentication, self-tightening, and LED progress indicators could be integrated into a band, while others explained a modular approach with batteries, displays, cameras, blood pressure sensors, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch's hidden diagnostic port was once speculated to facilitate Smart Bands. At the time, the diagnostic connector, which is purportedly based on the design of the Lightning connector, was said to be capable of supporting future accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird-party accessory makers were able to develop an external battery band that could charge the Apple Watch through the diagnostic port, but changes to the Apple Watch's software prevented the strap from ever coming to market. However, other smart bands not reliant on the diagnostic port have become available in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, Zompetti has shared images of prototype versions of the original Apple Watch, first-generation iPad, third-generation iPod touch, and iPhone 12 Pro.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Watch Series 3 Prototype May Show Contacts for Potential 'Smart Bands'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Google has updated its 2FA Authenticator app for iOS with a new privacy feature that lets users require Face ID or Touch ID before displaying two-factor account authentication codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, fingerprint or facial authentication was only required when exporting accounts. Now though, upon activating Google's Privacy Screen feature in v3.2.0 of the app, Face ID or ‚ÄåTouch ID‚Äå is needed in order to show newly generated codes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authentication requirement can be set to show immediately, after 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes. In addition, Google has added a search bar to the top of the app interface to let users search for accounts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Authenticator's previous update introduced a dark mode and the aforementioned account transfer feature. However, the latest improvements are likely to be seen by many Apple device users as verging on the redundant, following the news earlier this month that iOS 15 will include a built-in password authenticator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Apple releases ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå in the fall, iPhone and iPad users will be able to natively generate 2FA verification codes for additional sign-in security, so there will be no need for a separate app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says that you'll be able to set up verification codes under Passwords in the Settings app. And once set up, the codes will autofill when you sign into a site, making the use of two-factor authentication a more streamlined experience than using a third-party method. This feature will be available on ‚Äå‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå‚Äå, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey.\nTags: Google, Two-Factor Authentication\nThis article, \"Google Updates Authenticator App Ahead of iOS 15's Upcoming Built-in Code Generator\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple may include an under the screen Touch ID sensor for some models of the 2022 iPhones, according to credible Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an investor note today obtained by MacRumors, Kuo says that Apple plans to have four models in the 2022 iPhone lineup. Kuo had previously stated that the iPhone 13, destined for this year, will be the last iPhone lineup to feature a 5.4-inch ‚Äúmini‚Äù size. Kuo reaffirmed his belief today, stating that the 2022 iPhones will only feature a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch size, with two models of each size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe low-end 6.7-inch iPhone may cost less than $900 but could lack certain features such as an under the screen Touch ID sensor to compensate for costs. The current largest 6.7-inch iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, begins at $1,099.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProviding some details about the camera improvements coming to the 2022 iPhones, Kuo says the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones will feature an improved wide-angle camera with 48 megapixels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same note, Kuo reiterated that in the first half of next year, Apple is still planning to launch an updated iPhone SE that will be the ‚Äúcheapest 5G iPhone ever.‚Äù The update to the iPhone SE will feature a similar design as the current model, with improved performance.\nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nThis article, \"Kuo: 2022 iPhones May Feature Under-Screen Touch ID\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The highest-end Pro and Pro Max are also rumored to feature upgraded Ultra Wide cameras. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nBeyond camera improvements, the upcoming ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå Pro and Pro Max are expected to come with a 120Hz display and potentially always-on capabilities. Recently leaked battery capacities suggest that the entire lineup will feature larger batteries, possibly due in part to the higher power consumption needed for the higher variable refresh rate on the Pro models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones in September, in line with years prior to the global health crisis.

Facebook users can also \"raise a hand\" to join a conversation, and use reactions to participate in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Live Audio Rooms is set to receive more features that Clubhouse presently lacks, including notifications when friends or followers join a room and live captioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers can discover and join Live Audio Rooms within Facebook Groups. In private groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. Meanwhile, in public groups, both members and visitors can listen to the Live Audio Room, but in private groups, only members can listen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Audio Room hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the U.S.-basd public figures with first access to Live Audio Rooms are music artist TOKiMONSTA, football quarterback Russell Wilson, Internet personality Omareloff, and entrepreneur Amanda Nguyen.

          "description": "Despite previous attempts to put the situation at rest, some iCloud users continue to experience spam calendar invitations, causing their calendars to be filled with random events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation received widespread coverage in 2016, where Apple said that it was \"actively working to address this issue\" by \"identifying and blocking suspicious senders.\" Victims are targeted in various ways. The most common method is by receiving a normal iCloud calendar invitation through their calendar app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteracting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing \"Maybe,\" lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a video posted by Apple Support, that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation. By redirecting invitations to their email, users can better manage and delete calendar invitations.

September is the usual month for Apple to unveil new iPhones, but the iPhone 12 lineup was announced in October last year due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have a smaller notch above the display, but will otherwise have a similar outward design as iPhone 12 models.\n\r\n\r\nThe devices will be powered by Apple's next-generation A15 chip manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm+ process.\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhones will be equipped with OLED displays, while the two Pro models will also feature a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother content.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have the same storage capacity options as their iPhone 12 counterparts. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models are available with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, while 12 Pro models have a 512GB option.\n\r\n\r\nThe rear camera system on all four iPhones will be equipped with sensor-shift image stabilization, a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. For the new Pro models, the Ultra Wide lens will gain autofocus.\n\r\n\r\nThe LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the Pro models.\nWith the pandemic showing signs of easing in the United States and Europe, TrendForce forecasted that annual iPhone production for 2021 will grow by around 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to 223 million units. The research firm believes the \"iPhone 12s\" lineup will account for nearly 40% of that total production volume.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: TrendForce\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"TrendForce: iPhone 13 Lineup Will Remain Limited to Maximum 512GB of Storage\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Relying on the proven FinFET transistor architecture for the best performance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness, N3 will offer up to 15% speed gain or consume up to 30% less power than N5, and provide up to 70% logic density gain.\nWhile the report doesn't offer any detail of how the new 3nm chip can be implemented into Apple products, it's safe to assume its still years away. Apple's 14 chip, currently in the iPhone 12 series and iPad Air, is based on the 5nm process. The M1 Apple silicon also shares the same 5nm architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe smaller process provides improved performance and energy efficiency and offer more freedom with product design, thanks to their smaller overall footprint. \nTags: TSMC, digitimes\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier TSMC Readies 3nm Chip Production for Second Half of 2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced last year that it would embark on a two-year-long journey to transition all of its Mac computers, both desktops, and laptops, to use its own in-house processors. Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, M1. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the four Macs with ‚ÄåM1‚Äå and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\nIntel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs. Bloomberg reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as 32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics for future Mac releases.\nTags: Intel, Apple Silicon\nThis article, \"Intel Processor Market Share May Fall to New Low Next Year Due to Apple Silicon\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to Apple's announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nBased on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says \"The Shrink Next Door\" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac \"Ike\" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin \"Marty\" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.\nOver the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.\nThe project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of \"Truth Be Told,\" an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer. The series is set to return August 20, with new episodes released every Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIn season two, investigative reporter turned true crime podcaster Poppy Parnell (played by Spencer) dives into a new case that deeply involves her childhood friend turned media mogul Micah Keith (played by Kate Hudson).\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple TV+ Shares Trailer for 'The Shrink Next Door' Comedy Series Starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple is now, apparently, eyeing to use that retail space to sell its own iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Apple's own retail presence in South Korea is still relatively small, and accepting a deal with LG to sell its products at more than 400 \"LG Best Shops\" is an easy way to expand its presence.\r\n\r\nThe two companies are reportedly discussing the establishment of separate Apple corners within the shops that are directly run by Apple employees or allowing LG Best Shop employees to sell Apple products after LG Electronics acquires the right to the sale of Apple products. The two sides have yet to decide when the partnership starts, but some market experts predict that it will be some time after the end of July when LG Electronics completely pull out of the smartphone business\nAccording to the report, LG and Apple are at a disagreement over the sale of Mac computers. LG sells its own \"Gram\" laptops, and offering Apple's Mac in the store would be a disadvantage. As a result, the two sides are likely only to agree on selling iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. An LG spokesperson said in a statement to Business Korea that \"nothing has been decided yet\" and that they're \"exploring all possibilities.\" \nTags: LG, South Korea\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Wants to Sell Products in Korean LG Retail Stores\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:\nMacBook Pro (2018 and later)\n\r\n\r\nMacBook Air (2018 and later)\n\r\n\r\niMac (2019 and later)\n\r\n\r\niMac Pro (2017)\n\r\n\r\nMac mini (2020 and later)\n\r\n\r\nMac Pro (2019)\nWe've encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nTag: Apple Fitness Plus\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"macOS Monterey Brings Apple Fitness+ to the Mac With AirPlay\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple would not be permitted to sell iPhones with its own apps installed under proposed U.S. antitrust legislation that was released last week. Representative David Cicilline confirmed the self-preferencing ban in a discussion with reporters, details of which were shared by Bloomberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRather than pre-installed apps, Apple would have to offer other app options for consumers to download. Right now, iPhones come with a range of free Apple-designed apps from Messages and FaceTime to Calendar and Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It would be equally easy to download the other five apps as the Apple one so they're not using their market dominance to favor their own products and services,\" said Cicilline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventing Apple from selling iPhones with its own apps installed would drastically change the iPhone's setup process, making it considerably less streamlined, more complicated, and potentially more expensive if customers were prompted to purchase or subscribe to third-party apps and services to replicate the functionality that Apple provides at no cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Cicilline, this would also apply to Amazon Prime because Amazon's ability to sell its own products over third-party products disadvantages some sellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. House lawmakers last week debuted sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation in the form of five different bills aimed at major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The bills would apply to businesses that have a market capitalization of $600 billion and at least 50 million monthly active users in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf passed, these bills would overhaul competition laws that have not been revisited for decades and would lead to significant changes in the tech industry. The House Judiciary Committee will review the five bills at a hearing next week.\nTags: App Store, antitrust\nThis article, \"U.S. Antitrust Legislation Would Ban Apple From Pre-Installing Its Own Apps on iPhones\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The CMA defines \"mobile ecosystems\" as \"gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services,\" meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CMA says that consumers could be \"losing out across a wide range of areas\" as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to \"reduced innovation\" and \"consumers paying higher prices.\" The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies' market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CMA was already investigating Apple's ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UK is also in the process of establishing a new \"pro-competition\" regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday, the Japan Times reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google's duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.\nTags: Google, antitrust, Japan, United Kingdom\nThis article, \"Apple and Google 'Duopoly' to Come Under Scrutiny in the UK\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple in iPadOS 15 has added the ability to access NTFS-formatted media from within the Files app. The additional support for the Windows-related format, first discovered by YouTuber Steven Fjordstr√∏m, is read-only, so like on macOS you can't modify files stored on NTFS devices, but you can at least copy any data on them for working on elsewhere on your iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Files app has also gotten a new circular progress indicator to indicate the transfer of data when moving or copying files. Tapping the graphic opens a larger progress bar showing further details on the data transferred/remaining, the estimated time remaining, and the ability to cancel the transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another notable addition to the Files app, if you're using a mouse or trackpad, it's now possible to click-hold and drag a selection box over multiple files and folders to perform batch actions, such as compress, move, copy, and so on. Lastly, you can also now use Groups as a view option, so that files and folders are arranged on the screen in separate sections according to kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the new additions to the Files app?

That promotion ends on June 30, and Apple has today updated its website to show that from July 1 the included free trial shrinks to three months with eligible device purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has frequently offered promotions or credit for users to stay subscribed to the still relatively new service. Launched in 2019, ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå continues to grow into a more mainstream streaming service; however, it still has some ways before catching up to Netflix and others. Apple offers original shows such as \"Ted Lasso,\" \"The Morning Show,\" and \"See\" on the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new three-month trial will go into effect on July 1, so customers wanting to maximize their free ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå subscription should purchase their product before the beginning of next month.

The company now appears to feel that the content offering has grown enough that a shorter trial will suffice going forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new extension comes ahead of a busy fall season for ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå, where several hit shows, such as \"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Morning Show,\" will see their second seasons debut.\nTag: Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple to Reduce Apple TV+ Free Trial to Three Months From July 1\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As listeners subscribe to more channels, the Listen Now tab expands with new rows to provide easy access to all subscription content. Listeners who subscribe to two or more channels will also see a My Channels row in the Listen Now tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs expected, Apple Podcasts has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then decided to delay its launch to ensure that the \"best experience\" is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple's 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.\nTags: Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions\nThis article, \"Apple Launches Podcasts Subscriptions\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now, the company has released a new ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the changelog for the release, spotted by 9to5Google:\r\n\r\nIn this update, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.\nIn the app's Settings menu, there is a new \"Audio Quality\" sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beta release for ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå user base on Android won't have to wait much longer to get these features, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 7 and later, all iPad Pro models, the 6th-generation ‚ÄåiPad‚Äå or later, the iPad Air 3 and later, the fifth-generation iPad mini and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/MacBook Air, and the 2020 or later iMac.\nTags: Android, Apple Music\nThis article, \"Latest Apple Music Beta for Android Adds Spatial and Lossless Audio\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.\nWhen a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company.

This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn't going away. Instead, it'll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.\nDay One's privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it's long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings.

One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.\r\n\r\nThis article, \"Apple Releases iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 Security Fix for Older iPhones and iPads\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with \"dramatically improved\" speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: Jon Prosser\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Next iPad Mini Will Allegedly Feature Thinner Bezels, USB-C Port, and Touch ID Power Button\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the questions as part of this year's end of WWDC survey reads, \"How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community's outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference.

          "description": "As part of WWDC this week, Apple revealed that newer Macs will be gaining support for Adaptive-Sync external displays with variable refresh rates in macOS Monterey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says Adaptive-Sync displays will be supported on any Mac with Apple silicon, like the M1 chip, as well as \"many\" recent Intel-based Macs. When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences > Displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"macOS Monterey to Offer Smoother Gameplay With Support for Adaptive-Sync Displays on Newer Macs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location. Users can also select the flag filter to show only flagged reminders and the priority filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå, iPadOS 15, and ‚ÄåmacOS Monterey‚Äå are all currently in beta testing for members of the Apple Developer Program, with public beta versions set to be released soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Thanks, Rub√®n)\nRelated Roundup: iOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Reminders Gains New 'Smart List' Feature for Easily Filtering Reminders Based on Locations, Tags, and More\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's 2021 ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end \"Pro\" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch.

Apple eventually changed the policy, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on iPhone and iPad.

          "description": "U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an \"evidence-based approach\" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those \"in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains \"very concerned\" about the data risks of TikTok users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's order says collecting of data from Americans \"threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,\" and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that \"pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States.\"\nThis article, \"President Biden Signs Executive Order Revoking Trump-Era Ban on TikTok and WeChat\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå in the works. The current seventh-generation ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017. \nRelated Roundup: iPod touch\nTag: Mr. White\nBuyer's Guide: iPod Touch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPod touch and iPod\nThis article, \"Unreleased iPod Touch 5 With Chamfered Edges and 30-Pin Dock Connector Shared Online\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It‚Äôs effectively a 10-minute mini-episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David as Apple‚Äôs head of app review for the App Store. Henri-Gold posted a 53-second clip to Twitter, but wrote:\nThe whole thing exists out there. I‚Äôm holding off on sharing the\nlink to protect the party who inadvertently released it; I don‚Äôt\nwant to cause any harm to their business over this. I encourage\nyou to not publicly share the link either. Thanks for\nunderstanding.\nA little late for that‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe full version that was posted to Vimeo was pulled overnight. The whole video is funny in exactly the way Curb is funny, but Curb Your Enthusiasm-style humor is not Apple-style humor‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand the difference has only widened since 2014. I don‚Äôt know how this project got so far, but the humor is such that I don‚Äôt see how Apple could possibly have used it, even in 2014. One joke that might have played as funny in 2014 but wouldn‚Äôt in 2021 is the central conceit of the video‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthat Apple‚Äôs head of app review is a capricious jerk who makes approval decisions based on inscrutable whims.\n¬†‚òÖ",

Less than 33% of iOS users opt in to tracking, according to ad-measurement firm Branch Metrics Inc.\nAs a result, the prices for mobile ads directed at iOS users have fallen, while ad prices have risen for advertisers seeking to target Android users. [‚Ä¶]\nDigital-ad agency Tinuiti Inc. has seen a similar pattern in its clients‚Äô spending, research director Andy Taylor said. When iOS users opted out of tracking, Tinuiti advertisers couldn‚Äôt bid on them, he said. That dearth of iOS users drove up demand‚Äîand ad prices‚Äîfor Android users. About 72.8% of smartphones world-wide use the Android operating system, and about 26.4% use iOS, according to Statcounter.\nTinuiti‚Äôs Facebook clients went from year-over-year spend growth of 46% for Android users in May to 64% in June. The clients‚Äô iOS spending saw a corresponding slowdown, from 42% growth in May to 25% in June. Android ad prices are now about 30% higher than ad prices for iOS users, Mr. Taylor said.\nIf any part of this is surprising, it‚Äôs the claim that as many as one-third of iOS users have opted in to tracking.\n¬†‚òÖ",

But Rumsfeld was the chief advocate of every disaster in the years after September 11. Wherever the United States government contemplated a wrong turn, Rumsfeld was there first with his hard smile‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsquinting, mocking the cautious, shoving his country deeper into a hole.

That might not sound like some shocking revelation, but trust\nme, I had all but relegated the tablet to video watching and light\ngaming duties. Since this month‚Äôs release of the iPadOS 15 beta,\nhowever, I‚Äôve left my laptop mostly behind and have done the vast\nmajority of my work from the iPad.\nNow I have even stronger feelings for what Apple Inc. needs to\nchange about the iPad‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it goes beyond software. It‚Äôs time\nfor a giant screen, one in the 14-inch to 16-inch range. I love\nthe speed, touchscreen, versatility and Magic Keyboard, but the\n12.9-inch display is far too small for someone accustomed to a\n16-inch MacBook Pro.\nAnd I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks that: I‚Äôm told that Apple has\nengineers and designers exploring larger iPads that could hit\nstores a couple of years down the road at the earliest. They‚Äôre\nunlikely for next year‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwith Apple‚Äôs attention on a redesigned\niPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it‚Äôs possible they\nnever come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for\nmany people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines\nbetween tablet and laptop.\nI dig the conversational tone here. Gurman is, indisputably, the best and most accurate Apple rumor reporter. But his writing feels held back by Bloomberg‚Äôs restrictive house style for reporting. With this newsletter he‚Äôs freed from all the repetitive boilerplate about ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because blah blah blah‚Äù.\nAs for bigger iPads, would a 16-inch iPad still be hand-holdable? If not, would it be in a true laptop enclosure? Or could they make it hand-holdable by making it even thinner?\n¬†‚òÖ",

          "description": "Dan Rayburn, writing for Streaming Media Blog:\nOn Monday, Apple announced some new privacy features in iCloud,\none of which they are calling Private Relay. The way it works is\nthat when you go to a website using Safari, iCloud Private Relay\ntakes your IP address to connect you to the website and then\nencrypts the URL so that app developers, and even Apple, don‚Äôt\nknow what website you are visiting. The IP and encrypted URL then\ntravels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a\n‚Äútrusted partner‚Äù. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple\nwould not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,\nbased on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on\nthe right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.\nIt‚Äôs a little weird that Apple doesn‚Äôt want to talk about who these ‚Äútrusted partners‚Äù are, because if we don‚Äôt know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them?

          "description": "Good overview of one of this week‚Äôs biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:\nApple‚Äôs iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it\nroutes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address\nfrom the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever\nmanages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is\ngenerally just one server between you and the website you‚Äôre\nvisiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ‚ÜîÔ∏é VPN\nServer ‚ÜîÔ∏é Website. Private Relay adds another server to the\nmix, which ensures that no one in the chain‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äânot even Apple‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâcan see the whole picture: You ‚ÜîÔ∏é Apple‚Äôs Ingress Server ‚ÜîÔ∏é\nContent Provider‚Äôs Egress Server ‚ÜîÔ∏é Website.\nThis is, as Apple calls it in their ‚ÄúGet Ready for iCloud Private\nRelay‚Äù WWDC Session on the topic, ‚ÄúPrivacy by Design.‚Äù\nApple made specific mention that while the ‚ÄúIngress Proxy‚Äù servers\nare run by Apple, the ‚ÄúEgress Proxy‚Äù (aka the server which\ncommunicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by\nApple and is under the control of ‚Äúa (trusted) content provider‚Äù.\nThis means that Apple doesn‚Äôt know what site(s) you‚Äôre visiting,\nand the third-party content provider doesn‚Äôt know who you are.\nI‚Äôm using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail‚Äôs new tracker privacy protection), even though I‚Äôve got an Apple One family account. I ‚Äúfixed‚Äù that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâjust figured I‚Äôd mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.\n¬†‚òÖ",

It‚Äôs not: ‚ÄúiCloud+‚Äù is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.\n\n\nAnother question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.)

Titled RoboCop: Rogue City, the first-person shooter will put players in the total body prosthesis of Alex Murphy, aka RoboCop, on a mission to protect Detroit.\nBeyond that, Nacon and developer Teyon didn‚Äôt reveal much about RoboCop: Rogue City, other than that it‚Äôs destined for PC and unspecified consoles in a couple years. Rogue City will feature an original story in the franchise‚Äôs universe, Nacon said in a news release. The publisher and developer are working with studio MGM to ‚Äúdevelop an authentic RoboCop game experience that is faithful to the franchise‚Äôs DNA,‚Äù Nacon said.\nTeyon certainly has experience bringing ‚Äô80s action heroes to video games. The Polish studio is perhaps best known for its work on Terminator: Resistance, the 2019 shooter based on the Terminator franchise that wasn‚Äôt the worst thing ever, and Rambo: The Video Game, a 2014 rail shooter that was, frankly, pretty awful. A teaser trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City hints at something similarly low budget and perhaps a bit janky, but still shows promise.\nRoboCop‚Äôs had a rough go of it in the video game space. Outside of the movie-to-arcade adaptation created by Data East in 1988, Murphy‚Äôs mostly starred in mediocre console games and free-to-play mobile fare (and one Mortal Kombat game) over the past few decades. Here‚Äôs hoping that Nacon (formerly known as Bigben Interactive) and Teyon will turn things around for ol‚Äô Robo for his next adventure.\nAs for RoboCop‚Äôs next cinematic adventure, a planned direct sequel was in the works with director Neill Blomkamp, who left the project shortly after it was announced.",

Malgus has been a threat in the game since the very beginning, and the conflict with him has been building throughout various quests and campaigns.\nAfter Star Wars: The Old Republic‚Äôs launch in 2011, the story took a diversion into exploring a third faction, the Eternal Empire.

In addition, players can expect some big improvements to day-to-day play style. The character customization, class design, and itemization is all being streamlined and improved.\nThe most interesting addition is Combat Styles, which means ‚Äúindependently choosing a specific class story and combining it with ability sets from other related tech or Force-wielding classes.‚Äù In short, it‚Äôs less about picking one class and being restrained to specific abilities, and more about going with a tech or Force character, then mixing and matching components to build a playing style you enjoy.\nLegacy of the Sith will arrive during the holiday season in 2021, and kick off The Old Republic‚Äôs 10th anniversary event, which runs throughout 2022.",

It will cost $39.99 for the console version and $29.99 for the PC version. \nThe remaster brings back the original three games with updated graphics and additional, modern features like online challenges and leaderboards.

Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania recreates roughly 300 levels and 12 minigames from the first three games.\nIn the Super Monkey Ball franchise, players navigate a monkey in a hamster ball while playing sports-inspired minigames or perilous and zany obstacle courses. The first two games launched in the early 2000s  exclusively to the GameCube. The franchise has since launched on numerous platforms, consoles to mobile versions, with more than a dozen titles.\nSega also announced a Digital Deluxe version of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. It will feature six additional classic character skins, three legendary console skins, 10 customizable items and the classic soundtrack.

The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn‚Äôt get it with one of two premium editions in the game‚Äôs October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.\nWatch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon‚Äôs Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.\nPost-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.",

The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game‚Äôs latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft‚Äôs E3 2021 presentation. \nThe trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. \n\n\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege‚Äôs Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies ‚Äî instead of the series‚Äô usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020‚Äôs pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. \nJust like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series‚Äô tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down ‚Äî or escape from ‚Äî infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege ‚Äî including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  \nRainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.",

Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.\nOne player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they‚Äôre tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It‚Äôll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it‚Äôs controlled by a skilled player.\nWhile moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It‚Äôll also be necessary to actively manage your player character‚Äôs fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.\nEvil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.\nThe story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana‚Äôs sister. Their planet ‚Äî which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature ‚Äî has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.\nWhat‚Äôs interesting though, is that this game expressly isn‚Äôt about war or conflict. ‚ÄúThis is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet ‚Äìand the journey to keep it that way,‚Äù a description from the developers said. \nThe world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. \nA release shared that the visual style ‚Äúcombines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.‚Äù The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, ‚Äúallowing its incredible artwork to come to life.‚Äù\nIn the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There‚Äôs a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. \nHowever, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It‚Äôs a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. \nPlanet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.",

Martin‚Äôs long-awaited game arrives in 2022\n Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday‚Äôs Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.\nThe new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date ‚Äî Jan. 21, 2022 ‚Äî and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.\nElden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren‚Äôt accustomed to: horses!\nCheck out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.\n\n\nThe last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year‚Äôs E3 as FromSoftware‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest game to-date,‚Äù and is said to be set in a ‚Äúsprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history‚Äù crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.\nMiyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be ‚Äúfull of things that we weren‚Äôt able to do in the Dark Souls series.‚Äù The game will focus ‚Äúmore heavily on RPG elements,‚Äù Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and ‚Äúwill include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.‚Äù\nFromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.\nElden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.",

Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.\nWe saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. \nThere‚Äôs an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.\nBloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021.

There‚Äôs no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.\nThe new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We‚Äôll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.\nThere are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.\nAmong Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It‚Äôs a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it‚Äôs still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.",

One thing that wasn‚Äôt clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. \nCall of Duty: Warzone‚Äôs previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo.

          "description": "The galaxy is wild. Our solar system, with its surprising abundance of living creatures and nonstop radiation and asteroid showers, is a placid, private garden compared to the rest of it. \nIn particular, there are perhaps trillions of rogue planets (planetary bodies ranging from little rocky Earth-sized guys to super-Jupiter gas giants) in the Milky Way, including a surprisingly large fleet of the things right near the galactic core.\nThis is unusual, since the typical way we detect exoplanets is by marking their repeated procession across a star. But rogue planets, by definition, don‚Äôt orbit stars. So the way astronomers find them is a little different, requiring use of gravitational microlensing.\nGizmodo breaks it down:\nData gathered by NASA‚Äôs now-retired Kepler Space Telescope has revealed a small population of free-floating planets near the Galactic Bulge. The new finding raises hope that a pair of upcoming missions will result in further detections of unbound planets, which drift through space separated from their home stars‚Ä¶.\nIt‚Äôs impossible to know what the conditions are like on these presumed rogue exoplanets, but [astronomer Iain] McDonald said they could be ‚Äúcold, icy wastelands,‚Äù and, if similar in size to Earth, their surfaces would ‚Äúclosely resemble bodies in the outer Solar System, like Pluto.‚Äù\nThe new paper suggests the presence of a large population of Earth-sized rogue planets in the Milky Way. It‚Äôs becoming clear that free-floating planets are common. McDonald said his team is currently working to come up with a more precise estimate for how many of them might exist.\n\n\nDid you catch that part about how McDonald‚Äôs team made this discovery using a now-retired telescope? Yeah. Apparently the new telescope projects coming online are both more powerful and (in particular) better equipped to detect gravitational lensing effects, and therefore more likely to detect rogue planets in the future. \nTags: planets¬†¬† space¬†¬† telescopes",

          "description": "Fermi‚Äôs paradox is fairly well known: given what we know about the chance of intelligent life appearing somewhere in the universe, why haven‚Äôt any other species to date so far made contact with humanity? You can formalize the paradox via the Drake equation or some other method, but that‚Äôs the crux of it.\nWhat‚Äôs less clear is how Enrico Fermi originally phrased the paradox. At Language Log, Mark Lieberman points out that each of the participants in the original conversation remembers it differently:\nAt lunch, Fermi suddenly exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù (Teller‚Äôs remembrance), or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever wonder where everybody is?‚Äù (York‚Äôs remembrance), or ‚ÄúBut where is everybody?‚Äù (Konopinski‚Äôs remembrance).\nAs Liberman writes, ‚Äúour memory of exact word sequences usually fades more quickly than our memory of (contextually interpreted) meanings. More broadly, the exact auditory sensations normally fade very quickly; the corresponding word sequences fade a bit more slowly; and the interpreted meanings last longest.‚Äù \nMy own favorite (for purely aesthetic reasons) is ‚Äúwhere is everybody?‚Äù It just kind of says everything you want such an observation to say.\nTags: aliens¬†¬† Enrico Fermi¬†¬† language¬†¬† linguistics¬†¬† paradoxes",

But troubling safety practices persisted.\nWorse, researchers‚Äô success at uncovering new threats did not always translate into preparedness.\nEven if the coronavirus jumped from animal to human without the involvement of research activities, the groundwork for a potential disaster had been laid for years, and learning its lessons is essential to preventing others.\n\n\nIs it possible that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab? Yes. Is it probable? We can‚Äôt know that right now.

When the painting was cut [the lieutenants] were in the centre, but Rembrandt intended them to be off-centre marching towards that empty space, and that is the genius that Rembrandt understands: you create movement, a dynamic of the troops marching towards the left of the painting.\n\n\n(via @john_overholt)\nTags: art¬†¬† artificial intelligence¬†¬† Gerrit Lundens¬†¬† Rembrandt",

I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about this movie ‚Äî it won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Summer of Soul is out in theaters and on Hulu July 2.\nTags: movies¬†¬† music¬†¬† NYC¬†¬† Questlove¬†¬† Summer of Soul¬†¬† trailers¬†¬† video",

But I don‚Äôt save that enthusiasm for their prospects on society broadly. From the perspective of the built environment, there is nothing functionally different between an electric vehicle and a gasoline propelled one. The relationship is the same, and it‚Äôs unequivocally destructive. Cars, however they‚Äôre powered, are environmentally cataclysmic, break the tethers of community, and force an infrastructure of dependency that is as financially ruinous to our country as it is dangerous to us as people. In order to build a more sustainable future and a better world for humanity, we need to address the root problems that have brought us to where we so perilously lie today.\n\n\n Tags: cars¬†¬† cities¬†¬† Coby Lefkowitz¬†¬† global warming¬†¬† USA",

          "description": "In a TEDx Talk from 2017, LB Hannahs talks about their experience as a transgender dad, comfort vs authenticity, and the collision of theoretical gender roles & identities with the practicalities of parenthood.\nNow, for most people, what their child will call them is not something that they give much thought to outside of culturally specific words or variations on a gendered theme like ‚Äúmama,‚Äù ‚Äúmommy,‚Äù or ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù ‚Äúpapa.‚Äù But for me, the possibility is what this child, who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult, will call me for the rest of our lives, was both extremely scary and exciting. And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called ‚Äúmama‚Äù or something like it didn‚Äôt feel like me at all. And no matter how many times or versions of ‚Äúmom‚Äù I tried, it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable. I knew being called ‚Äúmom‚Äù or ‚Äúmommy‚Äù would be easier to digest for most people. The idea of having two moms is not super novel, especially where we live. \nSo I tried other words. And when I played around with ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù it felt better. Better, but not perfect. It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in. And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments. But, before I knew it, the time had come and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do, and my new identity as a parent began. I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.\n\n\n(thx, megan)\nTags: gender¬†¬† LB Hannahs¬†¬† LGBT¬†¬† parenting¬†¬† video",

Some things that are trees evolved from things that are not trees and other things that are trees evolved into things that aren‚Äôt trees. Confused? This might clear things up.\n‚ÄúTrees‚Äù are not a coherent phylogenetic category. On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are absolutely, 100% not trees. This means that, for instance, either:\nThe common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.\n\n\nSee also there‚Äôs no such thing as a vegetable and there‚Äôs no such thing as a fish.\nWhat would the evolutionary tree of salmon, lungfish, and cows be? The answer, it appears at first glance, is simple. Salmon and lungfish, being fish, would cluster nicely together on one branch, and very non-fishy cows would be off on a separate branch. Right? Wrong. Contrary to what you might expect, what you see above is their evolutionary tree. Working up from the root, the lineage that leads to salmon branches off first. Keep tracing up the tree, and you‚Äôll see that the lineage from which the salmon branched off eventually branches into two new lineages: the one leading to lungfish and the other leading to cows. In other words, a cow and a lungfish are more closely related to one another than either is to salmon.\n\n\n(via @smorewithface)\nTags: evolution¬†¬† science¬†¬† trees",

Van Langren wrote, ‚ÄúIf the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.‚Äù\nVan Langren‚Äôs image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study ‚ÄúVisual Explanations‚Äù (1997), ‚ÄúMaps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.‚Äù Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error ‚Äî how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.\n\n\nVan Langren‚Äôs graph, which Fry says ‚Äúmight be the first statistical graph in history‚Äù, is pictured at the top of this post.\nTags: Hannah Fry¬†¬† infoviz¬†¬† science",

Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock & roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:\nX-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl ‚Äî some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand ‚Äî and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.\n\n\nAnd from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:\nBefore the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.\n‚ÄúUsually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,‚Äù says Sergei Khrushchev. ‚ÄúBefore the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,‚Äù says author Anya von Bremzen. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha‚Äôs brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.‚Äù\n\n\nTo learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates‚Äô book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records ‚Äî here‚Äôs Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:\n\nTags: audio¬†¬† music¬†¬† Soviet Union¬†¬† video",

Dunbar explains in this Atlantic interview:\nThe innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your romantic relationships.

          "description": "Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:\nFrom its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America‚Äôs pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation‚Äôs top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic‚Äôs collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,‚Äù Walensky said.)\n\n\nThe pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that‚Äôll change for the better in the future.\nTags: COVID-19¬†¬† Ed Yong¬†¬† USA",

          "description": "Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world‚Äôs best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double ‚Äî that‚Äôs three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what‚Äôs going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air ‚Äî like absurdly and spectacularly high ‚Äî and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing ‚Äî it‚Äôs like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.\nIn reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: ‚ÄúHow is that even humanly possible?‚Äù As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.\n\nSee also Who Could Jump Higher on a Trampoline, LeBron James or Simone Biles?

His season ended immediately and the hockey world surrounded the Flyers‚Äô winger with support.\nJust several months later, he was able to ring the bell at the Abramson Cancer Center at Pennsylvania Hospital, signifying that his cancer treatments were complete and he was on his way to full recovery. And less than two months after that, he was back on the ice in the middle of a playoff series against the New York Islanders in September. A remarkable comeback for a player that has played a pivotal role on the team the most recent season.\nAfter coming back from his diagnosis and recovery, Lindblom played 50 games and earned 14 points in his supporting role.\nLindblom is the fourth member of the Flyers to win the Masterton ‚Äî Ian Lapierre (2011), Tim Kerr (1989), and Bobby Clarke (1972) have earned the honor before him as members of this organization. This season, San Jose Sharks legend Patrick Marleau was named a finalist for still playing well into his old age and passing Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL games played record, and Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba was the third finalist for continuing his presence as a co-founder of the Hockey Diversity Alliance and impacting his local community off the ice.\nAt least something pleasant has come as a result of the 2020-21 Philadelphia Flyers.",
