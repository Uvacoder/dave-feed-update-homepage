This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible. We still recommend you start using node-version: \"16\" in your .github/workflows/update-feed.yaml today to get the performance/security improvements from the newer node. See example\nChore: Reorganize to monorepo with npm workspace.",

I think this would be similar for a Rust program, but I’m going to use\nC because I find it a little simpler for a toy example and also you can do Terrible\nThings in C more easily.\nour test program\nHere’s a simple C program that declares a few variables and reads two strings\nfrom s…",
