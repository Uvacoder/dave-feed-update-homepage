          "description": "Starting with iOS and iPadOS 15 later this fall, hotspot connections from iPhones and iPads will be secured with the improved WPA3 security protocol, offering improved security and upgraded measures in place to prevent password guessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWPA3 was announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in June of 2018 with the goal to \"simplify Wi-Fi security, enable more robust authentication, and deliver increased cryptographic strength.\" On iOS 14, hotspot connections from an iPhone or iPad are secured only with WPA2, and now on updates coming later this fall, connections will be further protected with WPA3. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's products have been able to connect to networks with WPA3 security for several years, but until now, personal hotspot networks set up by those devices have only supported the older and weaker WPA2 standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the typical user, the hotspot connection experience on iOS 15 will remain the same; however, there are added benefits. Despite recommendations to create strong, complicated, and advanced passwords for hotspot connections, many users continue to use simple passwords that may be easily guessed. WPA3 specifically targets such use cases, as it uses \"more resilient, password-based authentication\" that offers \"stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS and ‚ÄåiPadOS 15‚Äå are currently being tested with developers, with a public beta being planned for later this summer. Check out our guide to see everything that's new. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Thanks, Noah!)\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Hotspot Connections Feature Stronger WPA3 Security\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Once that's done, it's just a simple matter of selecting it as your audio output destination on your iOS or Mac device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith ‚ÄåAirPlay‚Äå 2, you can use your newly connected speakers as part of a multi-room setup incorporating other speakers like HomePods, with audio output being synced across all speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntegration with the Home app also gives you the ability to incorporate your speakers into scenes and other automations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soundform Connect Audio Adapter with AirPlay 2 is priced at $99.99, so it's not exactly cheap, but if you got a nice sound system that lacks ‚ÄåAirPlay‚Äå support, this adapter can add some very useful functionality.\nTags: Belkin, AirPlay 2\nThis article, \"Video: Belkin's Soundform Connect Adds AirPlay 2 to Your Existing Speakers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is taking a major stride that will allow developers to improve the performance of their apps on iPhones and iPads, by giving apps the ability to access more of a device's memory or RAM starting later this fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, apps are limited to the amount of RAM they can use, regardless of the amount available on the device. For example, despite the highest-end M1 iPad Pro featuring 16GB of RAM, on iPadOS 14, apps are limited to only use 5GB. 16GB of RAM is the highest amount of RAM ever offered in an iPhone or iPad, and the 5GB limitation means that apps aren't able to utilize even half of what the iPad Pro has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second betas of iOS and iPadOS 15, released to developers yesterday, Apple is introducing a new entitlement that developers may request that w‚Ä¶",

Windows 11 will allow users to run Android apps, but the integration with Windows and iPhone is lacking. In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would \"love to make sure that it works better,\" referencing the iPhone and Windows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives revealed that at one point in time, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform \"would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage. \nTags: iMessage, Windows\nThis article, \"Microsoft CEO Would 'Welcome' Apple to Bring iMessage to Windows\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

One notable announcement was that, starting with Windows 11, PCs will be able to run Android apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogically, Microsoft would partner with the Google Play Store to offer Android apps on its platforms. However, the company is taking a different route, partnering with Amazon to open Windows 11 to Android apps. As reported by The Verge, users will search for an Android app offered through the Amazon app marketplace directly within the newly redesigned Microsoft App Store. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroid apps will run on the platform using Intel's \"bridge technology.\" Like traditional Windows apps, Android apps can be added to the new centered Windows taskbar, pinned, and snapped to different multitasking modes. Specific details remain unknown, such as hardware requirements and developers' need to make their Android apps runnable on Windows 11. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's announcement draws comparisons to Apple's announcement with macOS Big Sur last year and its transition to Apple silicon. Thanks to Apple silicon and the common architecture shared among Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, macOS can now run ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite Apple's best intentions, the experience of running iOS apps on Apple silicon Macs has been rough due to Mac's input being fully trackpad and keyboard-based, compared to the direct touch experience the apps were initially designed for.

Zompetti postulated that the \"two unusual pads are exposed to the band,\" and may be a kind of iPad-like \"Smart Connector,\" much like those from various iPad models, used to accommodate a \"Smart Band.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has filed a large number of patents around smart Apple Watch bands, indicating that it is something that the company has actively considered. Some patents showed how features such as biometric authentication, self-tightening, and LED progress indicators could be integrated into a band, while others explained a modular approach with batteries, displays, cameras, blood pressure sensors, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch's hidden diagnostic port was once speculated to facilitate Smart Bands. At the time, the diagnostic connector, which is purportedly based on the design of the Lightning connector, was said to be capable of supporting future accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird-party accessory makers were able to develop an external battery band that could charge the Apple Watch through the diagnostic port, but changes to the Apple Watch's software prevented the strap from ever coming to market. However, other smart bands not reliant on the diagnostic port have become available in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, Zompetti has shared images of prototype versions of the original Apple Watch, first-generation iPad, third-generation iPod touch, and iPhone 12 Pro.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Watch Series 3 Prototype May Show Contacts for Potential 'Smart Bands'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now though, upon activating Google's Privacy Screen feature in v3.2.0 of the app, Face ID or ‚ÄåTouch ID‚Äå is needed in order to show newly generated codes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authentication requirement can be set to show immediately, after 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes. In addition, Google has added a search bar to the top of the app interface to let users search for accounts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Authenticator's previous update introduced a dark mode and the aforementioned account transfer feature. However, the latest improvements are likely to be seen by many Apple device users as verging on the redundant, following the news earlier this month that iOS 15 will include a built-in password authenticator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Apple releases ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå in the fall, iPhone and iPad users will be able to natively generate 2FA verification codes for additional sign-in security, so there will be no need for a separate app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says that you'll be able to set up verification codes under Passwords in the Settings app. And once set up, the codes will autofill when you sign into a site, making the use of two-factor authentication a more streamlined experience than using a third-party method.

The device will be positioned as the \"cheapest 5G iPhone ever.\" The most affordable ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå with 5G right now is the iPhone 12 mini, so presumably the ‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå will be a good deal more affordable than the $699 price point of that device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been rumors of an \"‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå Plus\" with a larger display and a Touch ID power button, which Kuo has also mentioned in the past, but there's no word of this bigger ‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå in Kuo's note and we haven't heard new details about it for some time, so it is not clear if it's been scrapped or is something that's coming at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo also previously said that Apple is developing a new version of the iPhone 11 with a 6-inch LCD, Face ID support, and 5G, and it's possible thst this future device, which is said to be launching in 2023, will also be in the SE family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no specific word on when we can expect the next-generation ‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå, but the first half of 2022 perhaps suggests a spring event.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone SE 2020\nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone SE (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Kuo: 2022 iPhone SE Will Be the 'Cheapest 5G iPhone Ever'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Kuo had previously stated that the iPhone 13, destined for this year, will be the last iPhone lineup to feature a 5.4-inch ‚Äúmini‚Äù size. Kuo reaffirmed his belief today, stating that the 2022 iPhones will only feature a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch size, with two models of each size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe low-end 6.7-inch iPhone may cost less than $900 but could lack certain features such as an under the screen Touch ID sensor to compensate for costs. The current largest 6.7-inch iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, begins at $1,099.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProviding some details about the camera improvements coming to the 2022 iPhones, Kuo says the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones will feature an improved wide-angle camera with 48 megapixels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same note, Kuo reiterated that in the first half of next year, Apple is still planning to launch an updated iPhone SE that will be the ‚Äúcheapest 5G iPhone ever.‚Äù The update to the iPhone SE will feature a similar design as the current model, with improved performance.\nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nThis article, \"Kuo: 2022 iPhones May Feature Under-Screen Touch ID\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Facebook users can also \"raise a hand\" to join a conversation, and use reactions to participate in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Live Audio Rooms is set to receive more features that Clubhouse presently lacks, including notifications when friends or followers join a room and live captioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers can discover and join Live Audio Rooms within Facebook Groups. In private groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. Meanwhile, in public groups, both members and visitors can listen to the Live Audio Room, but in private groups, only members can listen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Audio Room hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the U.S.-basd public figures with first access to Live Audio Rooms are music artist TOKiMONSTA, football quarterback Russell Wilson, Internet personality Omareloff, and entrepreneur Amanda Nguyen.

          "description": "Apple is set to receive supply priority status from pure play foundry TSMC for iPhone 13 chip orders going into the third quarter of 2021, as the Taiwanese partner grapples with orders for automative and other device chips amid a supply shortfall, according to DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nTSMC is also set to ramp up its output for the upcoming iPhone series in the third quarter, the sources indicated.\nOther chip suppliers in Apple's supply chain, including Genesys Logic and Parade Technologies, are also scaling up supply to fulfill Apple's orders for the third quarter, which are said to be 30-40% higher than second quarter levels. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå series expected to follow a more usual launch timeline this year, chipmakers are poised to see Apple's orders peak for 2021 in the fourth quarter, said DigiTimes' supply chain sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå models dropping in September are expected to look similar to the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end \"Pro\" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough major design changes aren't expected, rumors suggest camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch.

          "description": "Despite previous attempts to put the situation at rest, some iCloud users continue to experience spam calendar invitations, causing their calendars to be filled with random events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation received widespread coverage in 2016, where Apple said that it was \"actively working to address this issue\" by \"identifying and blocking suspicious senders.\" Victims are targeted in various ways. The most common method is by receiving a normal iCloud calendar invitation through their calendar app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteracting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing \"Maybe,\" lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a video posted by Apple Support, that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation. By redirecting invitations to their email, users can better manage and delete calendar invitations.

September is the usual month for Apple to unveil new iPhones, but the iPhone 12 lineup was announced in October last year due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have a smaller notch above the display, but will otherwise have a similar outward design as iPhone 12 models.\n\r\n\r\nThe devices will be powered by Apple's next-generation A15 chip manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm+ process.\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhones will be equipped with OLED displays, while the two Pro models will also feature a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother content.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have the same storage capacity options as their iPhone 12 counterparts. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models are available with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, while 12 Pro models have a 512GB option.\n\r\n\r\nThe rear camera system on all four iPhones will be equipped with sensor-shift image stabilization, a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. For the new Pro models, the Ultra Wide lens will gain autofocus.\n\r\n\r\nThe LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the Pro models.\nWith the pandemic showing signs of easing in the United States and Europe, TrendForce forecasted that annual iPhone production for 2021 will grow by around 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to 223 million units. The research firm believes the \"iPhone 12s\" lineup will account for nearly 40% of that total production volume.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: TrendForce\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"TrendForce: iPhone 13 Lineup Will Remain Limited to Maximum 512GB of Storage\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Relying on the proven FinFET transistor architecture for the best performance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness, N3 will offer up to 15% speed gain or consume up to 30% less power than N5, and provide up to 70% logic density gain.\nWhile the report doesn't offer any detail of how the new 3nm chip can be implemented into Apple products, it's safe to assume its still years away.

          "description": "Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced last year that it would embark on a two-year-long journey to transition all of its Mac computers, both desktops, and laptops, to use its own in-house processors. Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, M1. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the four Macs with ‚ÄåM1‚Äå and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\nIntel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs. Bloomberg reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as 32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics for future Mac releases.\nTags: Intel, Apple Silicon\nThis article, \"Intel Processor Market Share May Fall to New Low Next Year Due to Apple Silicon\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to Apple's announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nBased on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says \"The Shrink Next Door\" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac \"Ike\" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin \"Marty\" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.\nOver the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.\nThe project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of \"Truth Be Told,\" an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer. The series is set to return August 20, with new episodes released every Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIn season two, investigative reporter turned true crime podcaster Poppy Parnell (played by Spencer) dives into a new case that deeply involves her childhood friend turned media mogul Micah Keith (played by Kate Hudson).\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple TV+ Shares Trailer for 'The Shrink Next Door' Comedy Series Starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The scheme is intended to help students prepare for careers in hardware technology and chip design. The grants will support each university's engineering school and help expand emerging hardware technology courses. Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said in a statement: \nThe HBCU community is home to incredible Black talent and we are thrilled to work alongside these universities to enhance the opportunities for their students. We know many jobs of the future will be in innovative areas like silicon engineering and we want to help ensure the leaders of tomorrow have access to transformational learning opportunities.\n The \"innovation grants\" will also include select scholarships, fellowship opportunities, and internships at Apple, giving students the opportunity to engage with Apple engineers and learn from their experience. \nThis article, \"Apple Awarding $5 Million 'Innovation Grants' to Four Historically Black Colleges and Universities\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple is now, apparently, eyeing to use that retail space to sell its own iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Apple's own retail presence in South Korea is still relatively small, and accepting a deal with LG to sell its products at more than 400 \"LG Best Shops\" is an easy way to expand its presence.\r\n\r\nThe two companies are reportedly discussing the establishment of separate Apple corners within the shops that are directly run by Apple employees or allowing LG Best Shop employees to sell Apple products after LG Electronics acquires the right to the sale of Apple products. The two sides have yet to decide when the partnership starts, but some market experts predict that it will be some time after the end of July when LG Electronics completely pull out of the smartphone business\nAccording to the report, LG and Apple are at a disagreement over the sale of Mac computers. LG sells its own \"Gram\" laptops, and offering Apple's Mac in the store would be a disadvantage. As a result, the two sides are likely only to agree on selling iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. An LG spokesperson said in a statement to Business Korea that \"nothing has been decided yet\" and that they're \"exploring all possibilities.\" \nTags: LG, South Korea\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Wants to Sell Products in Korean LG Retail Stores\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:\nMacBook Pro (2018 and later)\n\r\n\r\nMacBook Air (2018 and later)\n\r\n\r\niMac (2019 and later)\n\r\n\r\niMac Pro (2017)\n\r\n\r\nMac mini (2020 and later)\n\r\n\r\nMac Pro (2019)\nWe've encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nTag: Apple Fitness Plus\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"macOS Monterey Brings Apple Fitness+ to the Mac With AirPlay\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple would not be permitted to sell iPhones with its own apps installed under proposed U.S. antitrust legislation that was released last week. Representative David Cicilline confirmed the self-preferencing ban in a discussion with reporters, details of which were shared by Bloomberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRather than pre-installed apps, Apple would have to offer other app options for consumers to download. Right now, iPhones come with a range of free Apple-designed apps from Messages and FaceTime to Calendar and Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It would be equally easy to download the other five apps as the Apple one so they're not using their market dominance to favor their own products and services,\" said Cicilline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventing Apple from selling iPhones with its own apps installed would drastically change the iPhone's setup process, making it considerably less streamlined, more complicated, and potentially more expensive if customers were prompted to purchase or subscribe to third-party apps and services to replicate the functionality that Apple provides at no cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Cicilline, this would also apply to Amazon Prime because Amazon's ability to sell its own products over third-party products disadvantages some sellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. House lawmakers last week debuted sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation in the form of five different bills aimed at major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The bills would apply to businesses that have a market capitalization of $600 billion and at least 50 million monthly active users in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf passed, these bills would overhaul competition laws that have not been revisited for decades and would lead to significant changes in the tech industry. The House Judiciary Committee will review the five bills at a hearing next week.\nTags: App Store, antitrust\nThis article, \"U.S. Antitrust Legislation Would Ban Apple From Pre-Installing Its Own Apps on iPhones\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today announced an investigation into the \"duopoly\" of Apple and Google on mobile ecosystems, just one day after a similar investigation was initiated in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CMA will be taking a closer look at Apple and Google's \"effective duopoly\" on the supply of operating systems, including iOS and Android, the App Store and Google Play Store, and web browsers such as Safari and Chrome. The CMA defines \"mobile ecosystems\" as \"gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services,\" meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CMA says that consumers could be \"losing out across a wide range of areas\" as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to \"reduced innovation\" and \"consumers paying higher prices.\" The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies' market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CMA was already investigating Apple's ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UK is also in the process of establishing a new \"pro-competition\" regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday, the Japan Times reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google's duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.\nTags: Google, antitrust, Japan, United Kingdom\nThis article, \"Apple and Google 'Duopoly' to Come Under Scrutiny in the UK\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple in iPadOS 15 has added the ability to access NTFS-formatted media from within the Files app. The additional support for the Windows-related format, first discovered by YouTuber Steven Fjordstr√∏m, is read-only, so like on macOS you can't modify files stored on NTFS devices, but you can at least copy any data on them for working on elsewhere on your iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Files app has also gotten a new circular progress indicator to indicate the transfer of data when moving or copying files. Tapping the graphic opens a larger progress bar showing further details on the data transferred/remaining, the estimated time remaining, and the ability to cancel the transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another notable addition to the Files app, if you're using a mouse or trackpad, it's now possible to click-hold and drag a selection box over multiple files and folders to perform batch actions, such as compress, move, copy, and so on. Lastly, you can also now use Groups as a view option, so that files and folders are arranged on the screen in separate sections according to kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the new additions to the Files app?

That promotion ends on June 30, and Apple has today updated its website to show that from July 1 the included free trial shrinks to three months with eligible device purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has frequently offered promotions or credit for users to stay subscribed to the still relatively new service. Launched in 2019, ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå continues to grow into a more mainstream streaming service; however, it still has some ways before catching up to Netflix and others. Apple offers original shows such as \"Ted Lasso,\" \"The Morning Show,\" and \"See\" on the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new three-month trial will go into effect on July 1, so customers wanting to maximize their free ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå subscription should purchase their product before the beginning of next month.

The company now appears to feel that the content offering has grown enough that a shorter trial will suffice going forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new extension comes ahead of a busy fall season for ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå, where several hit shows, such as \"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Morning Show,\" will see their second seasons debut.\nTag: Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple to Reduce Apple TV+ Free Trial to Three Months From July 1\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As listeners subscribe to more channels, the Listen Now tab expands with new rows to provide easy access to all subscription content. Listeners who subscribe to two or more channels will also see a My Channels row in the Listen Now tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs expected, Apple Podcasts has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then decided to delay its launch to ensure that the \"best experience\" is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple's 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.\nTags: Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions\nThis article, \"Apple Launches Podcasts Subscriptions\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now, the company has released a new ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the changelog for the release, spotted by 9to5Google:\r\n\r\nIn this update, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.\nIn the app's Settings menu, there is a new \"Audio Quality\" sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beta release for ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå user base on Android won't have to wait much longer to get these features, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå 7 and later, all iPad Pro models, the 6th-generation ‚ÄåiPad‚Äå or later, the iPad Air 3 and later, the fifth-generation iPad mini and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/MacBook Air, and the 2020 or later iMac.\nTags: Android, Apple Music\nThis article, \"Latest Apple Music Beta for Android Adds Spatial and Lossless Audio\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.\nWhen a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company. That's not the case here. I'll be remaining at the helm of Day One, leading the same passionate team that has been responsible for the development and design behind the app today. This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn't going away. Instead, it'll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.\nDay One's privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it's long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings. Day One Premium is priced at $3.99 per month and the app can be downloaded from the App Store.

Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:\nDrag and drop\r\n\r\nWith support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.\nTo drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that's dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.\nRelated Roundup: iOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Lets You Drag and Drop Images and Text Across Apps\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with \"dramatically improved\" speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: Jon Prosser\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Next iPad Mini Will Allegedly Feature Thinner Bezels, USB-C Port, and Touch ID Power Button\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences > Displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July.

For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location.

None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's 2021 ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end \"Pro\" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch.

There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai's Kia division, but it's not clear if that relationship has progressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment on the ‚ÄåApple Car‚Äå remains in the early stages, and Bloomberg suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Car\nRelated Forum: Apple, Inc and Tech Industry\nThis article, \"Apple Hires Self-Driving Car Startup Founder and Former BMW Exec Ulrich Kranz\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now, with ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå, ‚ÄåAirPods Pro‚Äå and ‚ÄåAirPods Max‚Äå can tap into the ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå network to relay their approximate location, even if they're out of Bluetooth range from the owner. ‚ÄåAirPods Pro‚Äå and ‚ÄåAirPods Max‚Äå will still need to be within close proximity to a ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå device, such as an iPhone, however. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚ÄåFind My‚Äå allows devices to crowdsource the location of other ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå devices, meaning even if they're relatively far away, ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå should be able to provide an approximate location.\r\n\r\nUse the ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå network to get an approximate location of your missing ‚ÄåAirPods Pro‚Äå or ‚ÄåAirPods Max‚Äå. This will help you get within Bluetooth range so you can play a sound and locate them.\nBeats headphones, also owned by Apple, added support for ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå earlier this year. ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå also gained other new features in ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå, including brand new separation alerts that notify users if a ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå compatible device is left behind, a brand new Find My widget for the Home Screen, and the ability for ‚ÄåFind My‚Äå to locate an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå even if its low on battery, or completely turned off. \nRelated Roundups: AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, iOS 15\nTag: Find My\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods Pro (Neutral), AirPods Max (Buy Now)\nRelated Forums: AirPods, iOS 15\nThis article, \"Apple's Crowdsourced Find My Network Will Soon Help You Locate Your Lost AirPods Pro or AirPods Max\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an \"evidence-based approach\" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those \"in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains \"very concerned\" about the data risks of TikTok users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden's order says collecting of data from Americans \"threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,\" and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that \"pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States.\"\nThis article, \"President Biden Signs Executive Order Revoking Trump-Era Ban on TikTok and WeChat\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå 5 in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå in the works. The current seventh-generation ‚ÄåiPod touch‚Äå was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017. \nRelated Roundup: iPod touch\nTag: Mr. White\nBuyer's Guide: iPod Touch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPod touch and iPod\nThis article, \"Unreleased iPod Touch 5 With Chamfered Edges and 30-Pin Dock Connector Shared Online\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The way it works is\nthat when you go to a website using Safari, iCloud Private Relay\ntakes your IP address to connect you to the website and then\nencrypts the URL so that app developers, and even Apple, don‚Äôt\nknow what website you are visiting. The IP and encrypted URL then\ntravels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a\n‚Äútrusted partner‚Äù. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple\nwould not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,\nbased on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on\nthe right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.\nIt‚Äôs a little weird that Apple doesn‚Äôt want to talk about who these ‚Äútrusted partners‚Äù are, because if we don‚Äôt know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them?

          "description": "Good overview of one of this week‚Äôs biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:\nApple‚Äôs iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it\nroutes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address\nfrom the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever\nmanages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is\ngenerally just one server between you and the website you‚Äôre\nvisiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ‚ÜîÔ∏é VPN\nServer ‚ÜîÔ∏é Website. Private Relay adds another server to the\nmix, which ensures that no one in the chain‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äânot even Apple‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâcan see the whole picture: You ‚ÜîÔ∏é Apple‚Äôs Ingress Server ‚ÜîÔ∏é\nContent Provider‚Äôs Egress Server ‚ÜîÔ∏é Website.\nThis is, as Apple calls it in their ‚ÄúGet Ready for iCloud Private\nRelay‚Äù WWDC Session on the topic, ‚ÄúPrivacy by Design.‚Äù\nApple made specific mention that while the ‚ÄúIngress Proxy‚Äù servers\nare run by Apple, the ‚ÄúEgress Proxy‚Äù (aka the server which\ncommunicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by\nApple and is under the control of ‚Äúa (trusted) content provider‚Äù.\nThis means that Apple doesn‚Äôt know what site(s) you‚Äôre visiting,\nand the third-party content provider doesn‚Äôt know who you are.\nI‚Äôm using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail‚Äôs new tracker privacy protection), even though I‚Äôve got an Apple One family account. I ‚Äúfixed‚Äù that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâjust figured I‚Äôd mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.\n¬†‚òÖ",

Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook‚Äôs permission.\nSounds right.

It‚Äôs not: ‚ÄúiCloud+‚Äù is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.\n\n\nAnother question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.)

          "description": "Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:\nOne of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam\nLevine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he\nwas like, ‚ÄúHave you listened to this?‚Äù And he sends me this song\nand he was really excited. He said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe what I can do\nwith this.‚Äù It‚Äôs going to be really exciting to see how this\nevolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with\nthis, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to\ndo this.\nSo we went after the labels and are going to the artists and\neducating them on it. There‚Äôs a lot of work to be done because\nwe have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a\nsimple ‚Äútake-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through\nthis software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.‚Äù This\nrequires somebody who‚Äôs a sound engineer, and the artist to sit\nback and listen, and really make the right calls and what the\nright things to do are. It‚Äôs a process that takes time, but it‚Äôs\nworth it. [‚Ä¶]\nTo me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it‚Äôs going to do for\nmusic what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch\ntelevision that‚Äôs not in HD?\nOne of the advantages music has over television is you can‚Äôt take\nan old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on\nlow-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things\nwere recorded on multiple tracks, and so it‚Äôs possible to go back\nto a lot of the songs and be able to do this.\nThe article is behind Billboard‚Äôs ‚ÄúPro‚Äù paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it seems to work even if you‚Äôre not a News+ subscriber.\n¬†‚òÖ",

In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.\nI really do love the idea of these lotteries and giveaway promotions.

          "description": "Good column (and video) from Joanna Stern on Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù. The people who use the term ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that‚Äôs not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand the walls and gates can be what makes them nice. That‚Äôs been a recurring theme in the testimony from Apple executives in the Epic trial. Asked about rules and limits on iOS that Epic presents as nefarious‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äânothing but tricks to lock users in‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâApple witnesses typically responded by presenting them as features. That iOS is wildly popular not despite the ‚Äúwalls‚Äù, but because of them.\nIt‚Äôs a trade-off, for example, that anything you can install on iOS can be trivially uninstalled just by deleting the app icon from your home screen. The downside is that iOS doesn‚Äôt support any third-party ideas that would require system-level background agents or extensions. I can name dozens of great Mac utilities that I‚Äôd enjoy, if not love, on iOS, but which can‚Äôt exist on iOS because of the rules. That sucks. But those same rules mean there‚Äôs no way to mess up your iPhone or iPad by installing something you don‚Äôt like and which is difficult to uninstall. That‚Äôs great.\nBetter than ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They‚Äôre fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They‚Äôre also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks. Public parks are great too‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâin very different ways. We should have great public parks, and we should have great open computing platforms. But not every park should necessarily be public, and not every closed computing platform would be better off open.\n¬†‚òÖ",

Good communication is to the point, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel ‚Äúunheard‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ‚úäüçÜ vibes. The ‚Äúformal requests‚Äù at the end about employees with disabilities and the ‚Äúenvironmental impact of returning to onsite [sic] in-person work‚Äù are such transparent pandering.

          "description": "Dan Moren, writing at Macworld:\nMultitasking on the iPad is, to put it generously, a mess. Split\nView and Slide Over, first introduced in 2015‚Äôs iOS 9 and refined\na couple of times over the years, have always had the feeling of a\nband-aid slapped over a mortal wound. Their limitations (like the\ndance of getting an app that‚Äôs not in your dock into Split View)\nand awkward gestures (how many times have you activated Slide Over\nwhen you meant to simply swipe) feel cumbersome, especially\ncompared to the multitasking we‚Äôve always had on the Mac.\nSo I‚Äôm hoping that 2021 is the year that Apple finally cracks\nmultitasking on the iPad. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what that looks\nlike; there are those who argue for the wholesale transplant of\nmacOS‚Äôs windowing system, but that seems as though it might be\nanother imprecise fit borne out of convenience rather than actual\nappropriateness. Fundamentally, though, the iPad has always been\nbuilt around the idea of one app on the screen at any time, and\nit‚Äôs clear that simply won‚Äôt do in a world where people expect to\nbe able to run multiple apps at once.\nIt‚Äôs amazing how often I make a slide-over Safari ‚Äúwindow‚Äù on iPad without wanting to. And then I‚Äôm stuck with a new Safari instance with no actual tabs. You can get into Slide Over inadvertently, and if you do, it‚Äôs hard to undo it. It‚Äôs like instantly creating detritus you need to clean up. iPadOS is the only GUI system I‚Äôm aware of that has ‚Äúwindows‚Äù that don‚Äôt have close buttons.\nMy wife uses her iPad Pro more than any other device. She loves it. But Slide Over was driving her nuts until I showed her how to turn it off. ‚ÄúWhy is that on by default?‚Äù she asked.\n¬†‚òÖ",

          "description": "Apple‚Äôs Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:\nThe Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the\nbiometric sensor; it doesn‚Äôt store biometric templates, perform\nbiometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,\nhaving to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).\nThe Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be\nsecurely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be\nused, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and\nmatching operations and enforces security policies in the same way\nit would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the\npairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nthat is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the\nuser if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely\npaired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure\npairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nkeyboards.\nSo I was wrong in my article on ‚Äúsecure intent‚Äù this week‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does not contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it‚Äôs paired. But this contradicts the Platform Security page about ‚Äúsecure intent‚Äù, which states: ‚Äúthe connection is a physical link‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfrom a physical button to the Secure Enclave‚Äù. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac‚Äôs Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.\nThe Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are\ncompatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch\nID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the\nSecure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand\nvice versa.\nI did not know this‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äânifty.\n¬†‚òÖ",

The removal takes effect at 9 a.m. EDT on June 28.\nGOG.com noted in a forum post Thursday that it was pulling the games on request from the publisher. Polygon has reached out to an Electronic Arts representative for additional comment. All of the games involved, except for Syndicate Wars, are currently available through EA‚Äôs Origin storefront.\nSyndicate, by Peter Molyneux‚Äôs Bullfrog Productions, launched in 1993, with an expansion pack released later that year. It was followed by Syndicate Wars in 1996. The isometric real-time strategy and tactics game was rebooted in 2012 as a first-person shooter.\nUltima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld 2: Labyrinth of Worlds launched in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Richard Garriott directed and Warren Spector produced the first game; Spector produced and Paul Neurath directed the second. The two were packaged together for sale on GOG.com in 2011.",

The original Hellblade was released in 2017, and was praised for its narrative structure as well as the performance of Melina Juergens. That game told the story of Senua, a Pict warrior who travels to the Norse plane of Helheim.",

The new version of the game was revealed during Nintendo‚Äôs E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. \nThe game takes place on the fictional Hikami Mountain where players control several different characters as they attempt to survive the notoriously supernatural mountain and the variety of hostile spirits and ghosts that occupy it. Each of the game‚Äôs protagonists lends a different prospective to the game‚Äôs overall story of Ose Kurosawa, a mysterious shrine maiden who was chosen to be part of a powerful and dark ritual. \nMaiden of Black Water is the fifth mainline game in the Fatal Frame series and was originally released in 2014 on Wii U. Just like all of the games in the series, this one focuses on a series of supernatural experiences and spirits that can only be warded off by using a special camera, called the Camera Obscura. The new version of the game will also come with new costumes and photo modes that weren‚Äôt in the original, as well as updated visuals.\nFatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X sometime later this year.",

It also seems necessary considering Microsoft is supporting two consoles and, the Xbox Series X‚Äôs backward compatibility notwithstanding, some games are in fact Series X only.\nMicrosoft has long aspired to unify its video games presence under a single brand, but it still can‚Äôt quite seal the deal.

He directed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Transformers Devastation, two of Platinum‚Äôs better games.

Not that it‚Äôs ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5‚Äôs post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.\nThe season pass content also includes Far Cry 3‚Äôs DLC Blood Dragon.\nThe revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, ‚ÄúVaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me.

The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn‚Äôt get it with one of two premium editions in the game‚Äôs October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.\nWatch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon‚Äôs Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.\nPost-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative.

The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. \n\n\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege‚Äôs Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies ‚Äî instead of the series‚Äô usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020‚Äôs pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. \nJust like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series‚Äô tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down ‚Äî or escape from ‚Äî infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege ‚Äî including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  \nRainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.",

Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.\nOne player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they‚Äôre tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It‚Äôll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it‚Äôs controlled by a skilled player.\nWhile moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It‚Äôll also be necessary to actively manage your player character‚Äôs fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.\nEvil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

          "description": "Image: Summer Game Fest 2021\n    \n\n  \nThe trailer shows a tragic backdrop to a tranquil scene\n Planet of Lana is a beautiful new cinematic puzzle adventure game from the Swedish indie studio, Wishfully. It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.\nThe story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana‚Äôs sister. Their planet ‚Äî which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature ‚Äî has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.\nWhat‚Äôs interesting though, is that this game expressly isn‚Äôt about war or conflict. ‚ÄúThis is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet ‚Äìand the journey to keep it that way,‚Äù a description from the developers said. \nThe world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. \nA release shared that the visual style ‚Äúcombines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.‚Äù The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, ‚Äúallowing its incredible artwork to come to life.‚Äù\nIn the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There‚Äôs a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. \nHowever, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It‚Äôs a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. \nPlanet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.",

          "description": "Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco\n    \n\n  \nFromSoftware and George R.R. Martin‚Äôs long-awaited game arrives in 2022\n Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday‚Äôs Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.\nThe new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date ‚Äî Jan. 21, 2022 ‚Äî and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.\nElden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren‚Äôt accustomed to: horses!\nCheck out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.\n\n\nThe last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year‚Äôs E3 as FromSoftware‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest game to-date,‚Äù and is said to be set in a ‚Äúsprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history‚Äù crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.\nMiyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be ‚Äúfull of things that we weren‚Äôt able to do in the Dark Souls series.‚Äù The game will focus ‚Äúmore heavily on RPG elements,‚Äù Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and ‚Äúwill include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.‚Äù\nFromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.\nElden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.",

Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.\nWe saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. \nThere‚Äôs an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.\nBloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021.

There‚Äôs no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.\nThe new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We‚Äôll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.\nThere are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.\nAmong Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It‚Äôs a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it‚Äôs still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.",

We got a preview of the season‚Äôs changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.\nThe largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. \nMeanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what‚Äôs next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn‚Äôt clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. \nCall of Duty: Warzone‚Äôs previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo.

          "description": "In 1715, a significant chunk of Rembrandt‚Äôs masterpiece The Night Watch, including a 2-foot-wide swath from the left side of the painting, was lopped off in order to fit the painting in a smaller space. (WTF?!) Using a contemporary copy of the full scene painted by Gerrit Lundens and an AI program for getting the colors and angles right, the Rijksmuseum has ‚Äúrestored‚Äù The Night Watch, augmenting the painting with digital printouts of the missing bits. The uncropped Rembrandt is shown above and here is Lundens‚Äôs version:\n\nI‚Äôm not an expert on art, but the 1715 crop and the shift of the principal characters from right-of-center to the center appears to have radically altered the whole feel of the painting.\nWith the addition especially on the left and the bottom, an empty space is created in the painting where they march towards. When the painting was cut [the lieutenants] were in the centre, but Rembrandt intended them to be off-centre marching towards that empty space, and that is the genius that Rembrandt understands: you create movement, a dynamic of the troops marching towards the left of the painting.\n\n\n(via @john_overholt)\nTags: art¬†¬† artificial intelligence¬†¬† Gerrit Lundens¬†¬† Rembrandt",

Well, meet dark fish: biologists suspect that up to 95% of the world‚Äôs total fish population lives in a deep layer of the ocean that is difficult to detect and we know little about.\nAn international team of marine biologists has found mesopelagic fish in the earth‚Äôs oceans constitute 10 to 30 times more biomass than previously thought.\nUWA Professor Carlos Duarte says mesopelagic fish ‚Äî fish that live between 100 and 1000m below the surface ‚Äî must therefore constitute 95 per cent of the world‚Äôs fish biomass.\n‚ÄúBecause the stock is much larger it means this layer must play a more significant role in the functioning of the ocean and affecting the flow of carbon and oxygen in the ocean,‚Äù he says.\n\n\nSee also this thread from ocean scientist Andrew Thaler:\nThere‚Äôs a globe-spanning layer of mesopelagic fish that is so dense it distorts SONAR. For decades we had no idea what created the Deep Scattering Layer or why it moved. We still know almost nothing about it.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs astounding how much we don‚Äôt know about the ocean:\nThere‚Äôs an entire family of whales with at least 22 species that we know almost nothing about.\n\n\nWe know way more about stars that are billions of light years away than about some parts of the ocean a few hundred feet below the surface of our own planet.\nSee also dark fungi: ‚ÄúBy one estimate, there are between 2.2 million and 3.8 million species of fungi ‚Äî and more than 90% of them aren‚Äôt cataloged.‚Äù.

The festival was filmed and broadcast on a local TV station, but the footage was never commercially released and so unlike that other 1969 festival, this event largely slipped from public memory.\nNow, the Harlem Cultural Festival finally gets its due in the form of Summer of Soul, a forthcoming documentary directed by Questlove that uses that old footage to great effect. I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about this movie ‚Äî it won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.

But I don‚Äôt save that enthusiasm for their prospects on society broadly. From the perspective of the built environment, there is nothing functionally different between an electric vehicle and a gasoline propelled one. The relationship is the same, and it‚Äôs unequivocally destructive. Cars, however they‚Äôre powered, are environmentally cataclysmic, break the tethers of community, and force an infrastructure of dependency that is as financially ruinous to our country as it is dangerous to us as people. In order to build a more sustainable future and a better world for humanity, we need to address the root problems that have brought us to where we so perilously lie today.\n\n\n Tags: cars¬†¬† cities¬†¬† Coby Lefkowitz¬†¬† global warming¬†¬† USA",

What a fantastic illustration of the power of constraints and the abundance of human creativity. Ok, much of the imagery is borrowed from Star Wars and other sci-fi universes, but the stuff that isn‚Äôt is delightful. Even with no explicit narrative connection between the scenes, somehow this all seems like part of one big journey. One of the simplest stories we tell is someone moving from one place to another and it doesn‚Äôt need to be The Odyssey, Fury Road, or Thelma & Louise to be compelling.\nYou can also watch a video featuring all 2400 entries (it‚Äôs 2h 45m long) and a montage from a previous challenge featuring 125 artists.\nSee also Transfiguration: An Ever-Evolving Walking Figure.

Currently, 2014 UN271 is about 22 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun (for reference, Earth is 1 AU from the Sun). That means it‚Äôs already closer than Neptune, at 29.7 AU. And it‚Äôs not stopping there ‚Äî it‚Äôs already traveled 7 AU in the last seven years, and at its closest in 2031, it‚Äôs expected to pass within 10.9 AU of the Sun, almost reaching the orbit of Saturn.\nBefore then, it‚Äôs expected to develop the characteristic coma and tail of a comet, as icy material on its surface vaporizes from the heat of the Sun.

          "description": "In a TEDx Talk from 2017, LB Hannahs talks about their experience as a transgender dad, comfort vs authenticity, and the collision of theoretical gender roles & identities with the practicalities of parenthood.\nNow, for most people, what their child will call them is not something that they give much thought to outside of culturally specific words or variations on a gendered theme like ‚Äúmama,‚Äù ‚Äúmommy,‚Äù or ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù ‚Äúpapa.‚Äù But for me, the possibility is what this child, who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult, will call me for the rest of our lives, was both extremely scary and exciting. And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called ‚Äúmama‚Äù or something like it didn‚Äôt feel like me at all. And no matter how many times or versions of ‚Äúmom‚Äù I tried, it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable. I knew being called ‚Äúmom‚Äù or ‚Äúmommy‚Äù would be easier to digest for most people. The idea of having two moms is not super novel, especially where we live. \nSo I tried other words. And when I played around with ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù it felt better. Better, but not perfect. It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in. And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments. But, before I knew it, the time had come and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do, and my new identity as a parent began. I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.\n\n\n(thx, megan)\nTags: gender¬†¬† LB Hannahs¬†¬† LGBT¬†¬† parenting¬†¬† video",

Some things that are trees evolved from things that are not trees and other things that are trees evolved into things that aren‚Äôt trees. Confused? This might clear things up.\n‚ÄúTrees‚Äù are not a coherent phylogenetic category. On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are absolutely, 100% not trees. This means that, for instance, either:\nThe common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.\n\n\nSee also there‚Äôs no such thing as a vegetable and there‚Äôs no such thing as a fish.\nWhat would the evolutionary tree of salmon, lungfish, and cows be? The answer, it appears at first glance, is simple. Salmon and lungfish, being fish, would cluster nicely together on one branch, and very non-fishy cows would be off on a separate branch. Right? Wrong. Contrary to what you might expect, what you see above is their evolutionary tree. Working up from the root, the lineage that leads to salmon branches off first. Keep tracing up the tree, and you‚Äôll see that the lineage from which the salmon branched off eventually branches into two new lineages: the one leading to lungfish and the other leading to cows. In other words, a cow and a lungfish are more closely related to one another than either is to salmon.\n\n\n(via @smorewithface)\nTags: evolution¬†¬† science¬†¬† trees",

It resulted in earthquakes, tsunamis, fireballs raining from the sky, volcanoes, atmospheric heat shocks, wildfires, global winter, and the extinction of 75% of all species on Earth, including the dinosaurs. This video by Kurzgesagt leads us through what happened that day, minute by minute.\nThis video reminded me of Peter Brannen‚Äôs eye-popping description of this event from his book The Ends of the World:\n‚ÄúThe meteorite itself was so massive that it didn‚Äôt notice any atmosphere whatsoever,‚Äù said Rebolledo. ‚ÄúIt was traveling 20 to 40 kilometers per second, 10 kilometers ‚Äî probably 14 kilometers ‚Äî wide, pushing the atmosphere and building such incredible pressu‚Ä¶",

          "description": "For the New Yorker, Hannah Fry wrote a brief history of information visualization, a quiet innovation that has changed the world:\nVan Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, ‚Äúonly a graph speaks directly to the eyes.‚Äù Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them ‚Äî and the stakes dependent on those differences ‚Äî became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, ‚ÄúIf the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.‚Äù\nVan Langren‚Äôs image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study ‚ÄúVisual Explanations‚Äù (1997), ‚ÄúMaps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.‚Äù Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error ‚Äî how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.\n\n\nVan Langren‚Äôs graph, which Fry says ‚Äúmight be the first statistical graph in history‚Äù, is pictured at the top of this post.\nTags: Hannah Fry¬†¬† infoviz¬†¬† science",

Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock & roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:\nX-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl ‚Äî some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand ‚Äî and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.\n\n\nAnd from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:\nBefore the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.\n‚ÄúUsually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,‚Äù says Sergei Khrushchev. ‚ÄúBefore the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,‚Äù says author Anya von Bremzen. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha‚Äôs brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.‚Äù\n\n\nTo learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates‚Äô book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records ‚Äî here‚Äôs Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:\n\nTags: audio¬†¬† music¬†¬† Soviet Union¬†¬† video",

          "description": "Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:\nFrom its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America‚Äôs pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation‚Äôs top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic‚Äôs collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,‚Äù Walensky said.)\n\n\nThe pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that‚Äôll change for the better in the future.\nTags: COVID-19¬†¬† Ed Yong¬†¬† USA",

In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double ‚Äî that‚Äôs three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what‚Äôs going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air ‚Äî like absurdly and spectacularly high ‚Äî and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing ‚Äî it‚Äôs like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.\nIn reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: ‚ÄúHow is that even humanly possible?‚Äù As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.\n\nSee also Who Could Jump Higher on a Trampoline, LeBron James or Simone Biles?

Blending seamlessly into the rest of the design, it should tell you everything you need to know, without you being aware of it. Despite the many restrictions that are applied to dial layout, the creativity that can be seen in typography across horology is quite staggering. To put it simply, typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. As the dial is the main point of interaction with a watch, it is arguably one of its most important parts, and certainly one that can produce the most emotion. This is why typeface can play such a vital, yet subtle, role in how we experience and feel about a certain piece.\n\n\n(via the fox is black)\nTags: design¬†¬† typography¬†¬† watches",

The secret is stamping different groove patterns into the pasta dough.\nThe solution: something Wang, Yao, and their co-authors term ‚Äúgroove-based transient morphing.‚Äù They found that stamping flat pasta sheets with different groove patterns enabled them to control the final pasta shape after cooking. According to the authors, the grooves increase how long it takes to cook that part of the pasta. So those areas expand less than the smooth areas, giving rise to many different shapes.\nThe team found that the pasta reached its maximum bending angle after about 12 minutes and retained this angle for around 20 minutes before it began to bend back. The researchers were able to produce simple helical and cone shapes, as well as more complex saddles and twists (the latter achieved by introducing double-sided grooves).\n\n\nI am assuming those grooves would also aid in holding sauce better, a topic we‚Äôve delved into recently.

          "description": "Due to recent government reports, declassified data, media interest in those data & reports, and a long-simmering interest by the public, UFOs are back in the public imagination. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who is searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, says that there‚Äôs little chance that UFOs are aliens.\nI understand that U.F.O. sightings, which date back at least to 1947, are synonymous in the popular imagination with evidence of extraterrestrials. But scientifically speaking, there is little to warrant that connection. There are excellent reasons to search for extraterrestrial life, but there are equally excellent reasons not to conclude that we have found evidence of it with U.F.O. sightings.\n\n\nIf UFOs are alien craft, we would never see them:\nThere are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently visited by aliens, why don‚Äôt they just land on the White House lawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative, perhaps best exemplified by the TV show ‚ÄúThe X-Files,‚Äù that these creatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us. But if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem surprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures technologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances between the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams at night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.\n\n\nMore people talking about a thing doesn‚Äôt make it credible. More people talking about potential evidence of a thing doesn‚Äôt make it credible. Evidence makes something credible.\nTags: Adam Frank¬†¬† aliens¬†¬† physics¬†¬† science",

And less than two months after that, he was back on the ice in the middle of a playoff series against the New York Islanders in September. A remarkable comeback for a player that has played a pivotal role on the team the most recent season.\nAfter coming back from his diagnosis and recovery, Lindblom played 50 games and earned 14 points in his supporting role.\nLindblom is the fourth member of the Flyers to win the Masterton ‚Äî Ian Lapierre (2011), Tim Kerr (1989), and Bobby Clarke (1972) have earned the honor before him as members of this organization. This season, San Jose Sharks legend Patrick Marleau was named a finalist for still playing well into his old age and passing Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL games played record, and Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba was the third finalist for continuing his presence as a co-founder of the Hockey Diversity Alliance and impacting his local community off the ice.\nAt least something pleasant has come as a result of the 2020-21 Philadelphia Flyers.",
