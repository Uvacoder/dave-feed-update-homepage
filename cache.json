          "description": "Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple's $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple's cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple's upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that's \"roughly the same\" as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.\nTags: Google, Google Pixel\nThis article, \"Google Announces Low-Cost 5G Pixel 5a Smartphone, Plans to Nix Chargers in Box Going Forward\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Eve Spectrum bills itself as the first crowd-developed monitor, and it was in the works for quite some time ahead of launch. The Eve Spectrum is now shipping out and available, so we thought we'd test it out to see if it's worth picking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\n\r\n\r\nThere are three versions of the 27-inch Spectrum display. For $459, you can get a Spectrum QHD with a 144Hz refresh rate, while a 240Hz version is available for $609. A 4K version is also available with a 144Hz refresh rate, and this top-of-the-line version costs $799. The Spectrum stand for those who aren't using a VESA mount is an additional $99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors videographer Dan Barbera has been testing the 4K 144Hz version, and he found the design to be minimal, clean, and subtle, and for video editing work, it performed well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColors were accurate and natural and viewing angles were solid, but there is some light bleed with blacks and contrast doesn't quite measure up to some other displays at this price point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay was smooth thanks to the high refresh rate, and the high contrast and peak brightness made games look great. There were times, however, that the video feed would die, and it's unclear if the issue was a cable or a port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eve Spectrum comes equipped with a single DisplayPort port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, along with an audio port. There's no Thunderbolt support, but with a 100W USB-C port, it can charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few gaming monitors with these specs and HDMI 2.1, so for those who need these features, the Spectrum may be worth checking out. Make sure to watch the full video up above to see it in action.\nThis article, \"Hands On With Eve's Spectrum 4K Display\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The move is expected to primarily affect Apple, since many popular Android devices already feature USB-C ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the European Commission tried to reach a final resolution on the issue but it failed to come into law.

The study suggested five options for a common charger, with various options that cover ports on devices and ports on power adapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, the debate was reignited as the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of a common charger, citing less environmental waste and user convenience as the main benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe executive branch of the European Union is currently drafting the legislation, according to sources speaking to Reuters, which is expected to be presented next month.\nTags: USB-C, European Union, European Commission, Lightning, Europe\nThis article, \"EU Law That Could Force the iPhone to Switch to USB-C to Be Presented Next Month\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.\nAt first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the Apple Car. One report vaguely referenced Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌Apple Car‌'s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers. Apple is reportedly committed to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ is produced in the United States, but Foxconn does not produce batteries. \nRelated Roundup: Apple Car\nTags: Foxconn, nikkei.com\nRelated Forum: Apple, Inc and Tech Industry\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier Foxconn to Begin Building Electric Vehicle Factory in the U.S. Next Year\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is reportedly changing up the way it produces camera modules for its iPhone, now opting to individually produce each of the camera lenses separately, rather than procure them together and have them pre-assembled, according to a report from The Elec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report notes that up to last year, Apple's ‌iPhone‌ camera lenses were produced by its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film. The lenses were \"pre-assembled.\" Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.\r\n\r\nUp to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film that are pre-assembled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.\nFoxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System. The new system will check whether the wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras' lenses, including their optical axis and image sensors, are correctly aligned on higher-end ‌iPhone‌ models. An incorrect alignment could result in drastically reduced image quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new changes are being done to \"save costs,\" but it remains unclear if those savings would be presented to customers. It's also unclear whether the new production methodology and Foxconn's role in camera assembly will be in practice for the upcoming iPhone 13. Given that the new iPhones are already in production, that's unlikely to be the case.\nTag: The Elec\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Using New Method to Assemble iPhone Cameras in Effort to Save Costs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Things Cloud \"Fractus\" is a new way of syncing text.

          "description": "Apple announced earlier this year that, with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the Find My Network will be able to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the AirPods to a specific Apple ID, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌'s speaker holes to remove the linked account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst spotted by 9to5Mac, iOS 15 developer beta five code has confirmed that, to work with Apple's ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else's ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner's ‌Apple ID‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device's location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods Pro, AirPods Max\nTag: Find My\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods Pro (Neutral), AirPods Max (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"AirPods Find My Network Support Includes Tethering to Apple ID and New Manual Unpairing Process\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can't track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -> Privacy & Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using \"Clear cookies and site data\" in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, there's a new \"Forget About This Site\" option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirefox 91 is available now from the Mozilla website.\nTags: Firefox, privacy\nThis article, \"Firefox 91 Update Strengthens Online Privacy With Enhanced Cookie Protection\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Last year, a judge dismissed Apple's claim that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant's copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCiting court documents, The Washington Post reports that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple's grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLikely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year launched a program that would give security researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching security vulnerabilities and exploits. \nTag: lawsuit\nThis article, \"Apple and Corellium Agree on Settlement to Bring Lawsuit to an End\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefurbished iPads are covered by Apple's standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week.

Today's preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has already reportedly booked TSMC's entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year's iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple's plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We'll be sure to let MacRumors' readers know if the new report shares anything of significance. \nTags: digitimes.com, 2022 iPhones\nThis article, \"2022 iPhones and Macs May Feature 3nm Chips\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple plans to launch a new MacBook Air with a mini-LED display and several color options around mid 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors. These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser\n\r\n\r\nKuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an \"all-new design\" with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nTags: Ming-Chi Kuo, TF International Securities\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Caution)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Kuo: Redesigned MacBook Air With Mini-LED Display and Several Color Options to Launch in Mid 2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The judge decided that PMC's patent for digital rights management is unenforceable because the company delayed its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to get more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC filed hundreds patent applications in the 1980s and 1990s, but no patents were awarded until 2010. The company took advantage of a loophole that allowed for an indefinite application process and then a patent valid for 17 years. This was addressed in 1995, but didn't apply to the patents used against Apple because they were filed earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC delayed receiving its patents until after the technology in the patent had already been adopted, letting it make more money from tech companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal documentation from PMC suggested the company had thought that Apple would be a \"natural candidate\" to target with delayed patents, along with Intel, IBM, and Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC won a $308.5 million verdict against Apple in March after a jury said that Apple infringed on DRM patents with its FairPlay technology that is used to distribute encrypted content through iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Won't Have to Pay $309M After Judge Accuses Patent Troll of Abusing System to Fleece Tech Companies\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Previously only the latter card could be used, so the addition of Mastercard means Instant Transfer is more accessible to users who want to quickly transfer money from an Apple Cash balance to a bank account without having to wait for the transaction to be processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says that beginning August 26, 2021, the cost of making an Instant Transfer will change to 1.5% (previously 1%) of the transfer amount, with a minimum fee of $0.25 and a maximum fee of $15. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf users don't want to use Instant Transfer, they can also transfer money to their bank account using ACH and receive it within one to three business days with no fee. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make an Instant Transfer, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Cash card, then tap the three-dotted icon. Tap Transfer to Bank, enter an amount, and select Instant Transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently only available in the United States, Apple Cash can be used to make and receive payments in Messages, or you can get Siri to send money to a friend or family member. \r\n\r\n\nHow to Set up an Apple Cash Card on iPhone and iPad\n\r\n\r\nWhen someone sends you money, it goes on your virtual Apple Cash card, which is stored securely in the Wallet app on your iPhone.

          "description": "As part of a class action lawsuit settlement, Zoom says it will pay $85 million to users for misleading them about offering end-to-end encryption on its videoconferencing service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to ArsTechnica, the company was accused of lying about its encryption description on its website and in a security white paper, as well as providing user data to Facebook and Google without users' permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiled at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the proposed settlement will give Zoom users around $15 or $25 each, depending on whether they had a free or paid subscription between March 30, 2016 and July 30, 2021. Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, \"designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data,\" according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by The Intercept revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys. But that level of security was not what the service offered at the time.\nTags: lawsuit, Encryption, Zoom\nThis article, \"Zoom to Pay $85 Million to Users for Misleading Encryption Claims\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

An additional part of this effort involves moving Sprint's LTE spectrum to the T-Mobile network.\nAt the current time, T-Mobile has transitioned approximately 33 percent of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network.

          "description": "One of the new App Store features coming in iOS 15 is something called ‌App Store‌ events, which will see Apple highlighting timely events within apps and games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is now experimenting with ‌App Store‌ events on ‌iOS 15‌ devices, and in the Today view of the ‌App Store‌ on iPhone, users can now see a notice about a TikTok Summer Camp event that's set to take place today. The event is also being shown on iPadOS 15, as noted by 9to5Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nListed as a card in the Today view, the first ‌App Store‌ event has a label with the time that it takes place and a link to download TikTok, which is the app that has the event going on. Tapping into it provides more information on just what the event is, and in this case, it is a Summer Camp session where creators and artists can share their expertise with fans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple, ‌App Store‌ events will be used to tell customers about game competitions, new movie premieres, livestreams, and more. Events will be shown in the Today view, but can also be found in the Games and Apps tabs, in search results, and on the app product page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‌App Store‌ events are limited to ‌iOS 15‌ devices, so the TikTok Summer Camp event does not show up on devices running iOS 14.7.1. Events will pick up as the launch of ‌iOS 15‌ approaches, and everyone will have access when ‌iOS 15‌ sees a public release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new app-related features in ‌iOS 15‌ include an ‌App Store‌ widget that lets you see stories, collections, and events in the Today View or the Home Screen, and a privacy-focused feature that tells you which apps have accessed your location, camera, microphone, and contacts during the last seven days.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: App Store\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Apple Starts Highlighting App Store Events in iOS 15\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The first episode premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday, August 20, with additional episodes to follow every Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\"Truth Be Told\" descends into the world of true crime podcasts. In season two, Spencer reprises her role as podcaster Poppy Parnell as she dives into a new case that involves her childhood friend, media mogul Micah Keith, played by Hudson. As developments unfold in the case, their lifelong friendship is put to the ultimate test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the novel by Kathleen Barber, Apple says \"Truth Be Told\" provides a \"unique glimpse into America's obsession with true crime podcasts\" and \"challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple TV+ is Apple's subscription-based service for original TV shows and films, with pricing set at $4.99 per month after a seven-day free trial or a lengthier trial with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple device.

The most notable new feature is dark mode, which Google Maps app users have long been wanting. Dark mode is an alternative to light mode and allows for a darker user interface to match other dark mode apps on iOS devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Google, dark mode is going to be rolling out \"in the coming weeks,\" and once available to you, it can be enabled in the Settings section of Google Maps. Google says that dark mode in Google Maps will save battery and \"give eyes a break.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple first introduced the Dark Mode feature with iOS 13, but it has taken Google some time to bring support to its apps. Google earlier this year began rolling out a true dark mode feature to Android users, and the iOS version of dark mode for Google Maps looks similar to the Android version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with dark mode, Google today announced the launch of new Messages integration. With this feature, Google Maps users can share their real-time location with friends in an iMessage using the Google Maps button in the Messages app. Location is shared for one hour by default, but there is an option to extend access by up to three days or stop access at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle's blog post also highlights the recently introduced widgets feature, which allows ‌iPhone‌ users to add a Google Maps widget to the Home Screen or the Today View. Widgets can be used to check traffic conditions or find nearby places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Google Maps app can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the purchase was made as part of a plan to build an independent entertainment company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no word on how much was paid for Hello Sunshine, but Reese Witherspoon and current CEO Sarah Harden will join the board of the new company and will continue to operate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Apple did not purchase Hello Sunshine, the two companies will continue to work together. Hello Sunshine is responsible for \"The Morning Show\" and it is involved in multiple upcoming Apple TV+ projects including \"Surface\" starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, \"The Last Thing He Told Me\" with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series \"My Kind of Country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent rumors have suggested that Apple is exploring other purchase opportunities and has expressed interest in film studio A24. A24 has developed hit movies like \"Hereditary,\" \"Moonlight,\" \"Lady Bird,\" and \"Midsommar,\" plus it already has a content deal with Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA24 and Apple have partnered on \"Mr. Corman\" and \"On the Rocks\" along with and upcoming films \"Sharper,\" \"The Sky is Everywhere,\" \"The Tragedy of Macbeth,\" \"Bride,\" and more.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple Decided Not to Buy Reese Witherspoon's 'Hello Sunshine' Media Company\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple must face a patent infringement lawsuit over the heart rate technology in the Apple Watch, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in 2018, Apple was sued by Omni MedSci, with the company alleging that Apple used its patented technology in the Apple Watch. Apple reportedly met with Omni MedSci between 2014 to 2016 to discuss a possible partnership, but Apple is said to have ended discussions and used technology from four Omni patents anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, Apple attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci is owned by Mohammed Islam, who has been described as a \"poster child for a patenting professional.\" He owns six companies and has collected more than 150 patents. In the past, he has used those patents to sue companies that include Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia, and Siemens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam is employed by the University of Michigan, and Apple's argument for dismissal was that his patents were owned by the university, which the University of Michigan supported on behalf of Apple. The appeals court decided that was not the case, and that Islam's employment agreement did not automatically assign his patents to the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci has claimed that Apple willfully infringed on its patents. The company is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of the Apple Watch, along with damages. Omni MedSci's attorney told Reuters that the company is \"pleased by not surprised\" by the ruling.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Can't Escape Apple Watch Heart Rate Sensor Patent Lawsuit, Court Rules\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the \"Apple Watch Edition\" collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple's retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn't stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.\r\n\r\nApple hasn't said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here's my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn't sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn't surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what's the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? \nAs Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of \"Apple Watch Edition\" models with ceramic and gold. Apple may also decide to end the titanium Apple Watch models later this fall.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nTag: bloomberg.com\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Titanium Apple Watch Series 6 Models Currently Widely Unavailable\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.\nTag: IDC\nThis article, \"Apple Shipped More Tablets Than Samsung and Amazon Did Combined Last Quarter\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit.

Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple informed employees about the change in a memo:\n\"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated.\" The company added it is making the change \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nIn addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. \"Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it,\" reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Stores\nTags: Apple retail, COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice\nThis article, \"Many U.S. Apple Retail Stores Again Require Customers to Wear Masks\" first appeared on MacRumors.com",

          "description": "Nintendo today announced that it is sunsetting Dr. Mario World for iOS, a game that launched just two years ago. According to Nintendo, service for Dr. Mario World is set to end on Monday, November 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of today, diamonds, the game's in-app currency, are no longer available for purchase. Starting on November 1, Nintendo says an end-of-service notification will be displayed and the game will not be playable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nPlayers will be able to look back at their player history in \"Dr. Mario World Memories,\" a web page that Nintendo plans to launch later this year. This website will use player history, and customers can avoid being included by deleting their save data in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Mario World is a puzzle game based on the well-known Dr. Mario Nintendo title. Players are tasked with matching capsules with viruses in order to clear out all the viruses on the board, and Nintendo characters like Peach, Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba appear in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Nintendo's other titles, Dr. Mario World is a free-to-play game that included optional in-app purchases, but apparently the game failed to catch on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBloomberg last year said that Nintendo is \"retreating\" from its mobile game plans, focusing on already-released titles rather than debuting new games. Nintendo has had success with games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, but has not been able to maintain sales momentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNintendo previously discontinued Miitomo, Pokémon Duel, and Pokémon Rumble Rush. Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost, Super Mario Run, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, and Mario Kart Tour continue to be available.\nTag: Nintendo\nThis article, \"Nintendo Discontinuing Dr. Mario World iOS Game\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the \"A18\" or the \"M5.\" While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple's sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC's manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple's first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.\nTags: TSMC, nikkei.com\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier TSMC Readies 2nm Chips for 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

If we can deliver a better product. If we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we can do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we have an ability to do something better and therefore make a better product for the user. \nCook went on to explain that the M1 chip is a great example of that. \"We have the ability within our silicon team to make a product that's appreciably better than what we could buy,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse to the ‌M1‌ chip has been \"unbelievable,\" and has been powering Mac and iPad sales that are constrained. \"That's how we look at that and whether we should enter a market or not,\" said Cook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌M1‌ chip has allowed Apple to cut ties with Intel, and Apple is no longer reliant on Intel technology or Intel release timelines.

          "description": "During today's earnings call covering the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple CFO Luca Maesteri said that Apple is expecting supply constraints to affect the iPhone and the iPad in the coming quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher in the September quarter,\" said Maestri. The constraints will impact ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ sales in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not clear if these predicted supply constraints will affect the iPhone 13 models that are expected to launch in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple CEO Tim Cook was asked whether the supply constraints will continue into the holiday quarter, but Cook said that he doesn't want to predict that. \"We're going to take it one quarter at a time,\" he said. \"We will do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt.\" Cook went on to say that the constraints that Apple is seeing are the same constraints that are impacting other companies as well.\nThe majority of the constraints are of the variety that others are seeing. I would classify it as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.\nCook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: earnings\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Expecting iPhone and iPad Supply Constraints in September Quarter\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today announced two games that are coming soon to Apple Arcade, including the classic racing game \"Asphalt 8: Airborne\" from Gameloft and a new Zelda-inspired roleplaying game \"Baldo\" from Italian game studio NAPS team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally released on the App Store in 2013, \"Asphalt 8: Airborne\" is coming to Apple Arcade, but no specific release date has been announced. The popular racing game features more than 240 real cars to select from automakers and brands such as Ferrari, Ducati, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti, Mercedes, Audi, Ford, and Chevrolet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Baldo\" is described as an action-adventure roleplaying game with puzzles, exploration, and combat, all set in a hand-drawn open world. Players will embark on a journey into a magical land full of mysteries to discover as they complete the main story quest and many side quests. The game will be available on Apple Arcade starting Friday, August 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother racing game \"Detonation Racing\" launches on Apple Arcade this Friday, with players having to navigate an environment rigged to blow up, collapse, and burst into flames at the least convenient moments. The game hails from Electric Square, the creators of another popular racing game \"Forza Street\" and the \"Hot Wheels id\" racing system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.\nTag: Apple Arcade\nThis article, \"Two New Games Coming to Apple Arcade, Including Gameloft's Racing Classic 'Asphalt 8: Airborne'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Researchers are rethinking plans to use the Apple Watch in studies after finding inconsistencies in the data gathered by the device (via The Verge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in the Apple Watch's heart rate variability data are reportedly caused by Apple tweaking the device's algorithms, meaning that data from the same time period can change without warning. Associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the Beiwe data platform, J.P. Onnela, told The Verge:\nThese algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they're not transparent. So it's impossible to know what's in them.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital exported the heart rate data from Apple Watches for the same period of time, but several months apart. The data should have been identical, but since it is filtered through an algorithm prior to export it was drastically different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple changes its algorithms regularly and without warning, so exporting the same data at different times may use different algorithms. Beyond heart rate variability, researchers looking into sleep tracking have experienced similar problems with changes to algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mostly precludes commercial devices from being used by researchers, resulting in the need for devices specifically designed to collect data for scientific studies. While this is adequate for some studies, it heavily constrains research into the medical value of commercially available products for users. Some researchers say that Apple should publicize the changes it makes to algorithms or make the Apple Watch's raw data available.\nRelated Roundups: Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch SE\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution), Apple Watch SE (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Researchers Struggle to Use Apple Watch in Studies Due to Sudden Algorithm Changes\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple's iOS 15 website lists \"improved recognition for individuals\" as one of the new Photos features, and in a machine learning blog post shared this week, Apple gave more information on what exactly that means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says that on-device machine learning improvements have led to significantly better person recognition. The iOS 15 ‌Photos‌ app is able to detect people in extreme poses, people wearing accessories, and people with occluded faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo do this, Apple uses a combination of face and upper body to match people whose faces are not visible. Apple's machine learning blog says that the new functionality improves the ‌Photos‌ experience by identifying people in situations where it was previously impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's blog post on recognizing people in photos through on-device machine learning goes into much greater detail on how Apple uses machine learning to identify people while still protecting user privacy, and it's well worth a read for those who are interested in the inner workings of ML features.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Apple Explains How the Photos People Recognition Feature Has Improved in iOS 15\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is developing an external display that includes an A13 chip with Neural Engine, according to a new rumor from 9to5Mac. The A13 chip with Neural Engine would presumably serve as an eGPU, though details are light at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a CPU/GPU built into the external display could help Macs deliver high-resolution graphics without using all the resources of the computer's internal chip. Apple could also combine the power of the display SoC with the Mac's SoC to provide even more performance for running intensive graphic tasks.\nThere were rumors back in 2016 that suggested Apple was working on a new version of the Thunderbolt display that included a graphics card, but no such display ever materialized. In fact, no Apple-branded display came out ahead of the Pro Display XDR that was introduced in 2019, and the Pro Display XDR is just a display with no GPU included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9to5Mac believes that the display with A13 chip would be a replacement for the Pro Display XDR, and it's possible that the release version of such a display would use an even more powerful chip than the A13 that was first introduced with the iPhone 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is also rumored to be working on a more affordable external monitor that would be sold alongside the Pro Display XDR, but this more affordable monitor is apparently separate from the version with a built-in A-series chip.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pro Display XDR\nTag: 9to5mac.com\nRelated Forum: Mac Accessories\nThis article, \"Apple Working on External Display With Built-In A13 Chip\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "\"Ted Lasso,\" the most watched program on Apple TV+, saw its season two opening episode debut on the streaming service today. Apple is celebrating the premiere by giving the comedy series a full-page animated takeover on its website homepage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ted Lasso\" sees Jason Sudeikis reviving his Ted Lasso character that first debuted during the 2013 NBC Sports English Premier League coverage. In the ‌Apple TV+‌ show, Sudeikis plays a small-time college football coach from Kansas who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second season has been widely anticipated and was promoted by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's April event. The show regularly takes pride of place at the top of Apple's official ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ website, and also has a line of official merchandise associated with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor its first season, \"Ted Lasso\" received a record-breaking 20 Emmy nominations, the most of any comedy in its first season. It also won multiple awards, including a Golden Globe for Jason Sudeikis, who plays the show's namesake main character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second season of the show, which consists of 12 episodes, sees Sarah Niles joining the cast. New episodes will be released every Friday on ‌‌‌‌Apple TV+‌‌‌‌. Apple has already renewed the show for a third season, which the creators of the show have hinted may be its last.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"First Episode of 'Ted Lasso' Season 2 Debuts on Apple TV+\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple will release a new version of the MacBook Air around the middle of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in note to investors seen by MacRumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upcoming ‌MacBook Air‌ will feature a 13.3-inch mini-LED display, which would make it the second Mac to gain mini-LED technology after the 2021 MacBook Pro, which is rumored to include a mini-LED display and is expected to launch later this year. Mini-LED display technology will bring a signifiant improvement in MacBook display quality, allowing for a thinner, lighter design while offering benefits like improved wide color gamut, high contrast and dynamic range, and truer blacks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo has said that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will include a mini-LED display in the past, and the rumor has also been echoed by DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior rumors have suggested the 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will have thinner bezels than the current model, and that it will adopt the same MagSafe charging technology rumored for the MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also expected to include a pair of Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, and there's also a chance that it could come in multiple colors, similar to the M1 iMacs that Apple released this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will use an upgraded version of the ‌M1‌ Apple silicon chip that's faster and more efficient. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that it will feature the same number of computing cores as the ‌M1‌ (eight), but that will offer nine or 10 GPU cores instead of seven or eight like the current model for better GPU performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo says that if component shortages improve in late 2021 and across 2022, MacBook shipments could grow to approximately 20 to 22 million units in 2022.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Kuo: Mini-LED MacBook Air Coming in Mid-2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Twitter's beta for iOS has gained \"Sign in With Apple\" functionality, with the end goal of allowing users to create Twitter accounts using their Apple ID, but still in beta, the feature is still not fully functioning properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered earlier this month that Twitter was working to port over Sign in With Apple to its service. Wong's report was based on code found within Twitter's website. With its beta app for iOS, Twitter is now properly testing the functionality, with some beta testers seeing a \"Continue with Apple\" option alongside continuing with Google or no third-party sign-up service at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its current phase, attempting to continue with Sign in With Apple may prompt some initial errors, and once through with an account made, there are some quirks. Firstly, when users use Sign in With Apple, they aren't creating a specific password for that app or service. Instead, the app links the service to a user's ‌Apple ID‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, with a Twitter account made with Sign in With Apple, it's not possible to change account information such as email and more since the app asks for a password. These are technical loopholes that will get ironed out before Twitter rolls out that feature to all users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter is also testing other new features for its iOS app, including a new edge-to-edge timeline view for photos and an internal dislike button for tweet replies.  \nTags: Twitter, Sign in with Apple\nThis article, \"Twitter Beta for iOS Gains 'Sign in With Apple' Option\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

If it's raining, for example, CARROT Weather can automatically switch over to a precipitation-focused UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's update also introduces new layouts and designs for layout components, screenshot styles, along with support for wet-bulb temperature readings. Wet-bulb temperature readings are useful for determining human survivability in extreme heat events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT Weather can be downloaded from the App Store for free, and there is an optional $4.99 per month premium tier that unlocks new weather data sources, notifications, customization, widgets, and Apple Watch complications.

Joining a network named \"%p%s%s%s%s%n\" could, in some cases, permanently disable WiFi on a device, and in many other cases, it required resetting an ‌iPhone‌ entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the beta testing process, it was discovered that the bug was no longer functional, and Apple's notes make it clear that the issue has been addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iOS and iPadOS 14.7 updates also address a number of other security vulnerabilities related to audio files, Find My, PDFs, web images, and more, so all ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users should update to the new iOS 14.7 updates as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also security fixes in macOS Big Sur 11.5, tvOS 14.7, and watchOS 7.6.

If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine sentencing based on U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO'Connor's role in the Twitter attack was previously highlighted by Krebs on Security, and in a 2020 interview with The New York Times, O'Connor claimed that he was not involved in the hack. \"They can come arrest me,\" he said. \"I would laugh at them.

Using these methods, the hackers were able to gain access to Twitter's internal tools and were able to illicitly access Twitter accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties involved hacked into accounts belonging to Apple, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and more. Tweets were sent out from these accounts soliciting Bitcoin, and scammers received more than $100,000.\nTags: hack, bitcoin\nThis article, \"22-Year-Old UK Citizen Arrested for 2020 Twitter Hack Affecting Apple\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It is used to steal login credentials, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, and execute malicious files. The malware was discovered by security researchers at Check Point Software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA server hosting the macOS version of XLoader is available to bad actors on the dark web for $49 per month. Check Point tracked XLoader for a six-month period, seeing requests from 69 countries, indicating significant use across the world. More than half of all victims were based in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormbook continues to be a prevalent threat, being part of over 1,000 malware campaigns in the last three years, and XLoader is expected to have even wider use given its cross-platform capability and greater level of sophistication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHead of Cyber Research at Check Point, Yaniv Balmas, said that macOS's growing popularity has exposed it to increasing attention from cybercriminals, who see the platform as a worthwhile target.\nWhile there might be a gap between Windows and macOS malware, the gap is slowly closing over time. The truth is that macOS malware is becoming bigger and more dangerous.\nAccording to Check Point, XLoader is stealthy enough for it to remain hidden to most users. It is possible to check for its presence by using macOS's Autorun to check the username in the OS and look into the LaunchAgents folder, where entries with suspicious filenames should be deleted.\nTag: malware\nThis article, \"Common Windows Malware Can Now Infect Macs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "A class action lawsuit that Apple was facing over \"Flexgate\" issues affecting MacBook Pro displays has been dismissed by a California federal judge, reports Law360.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiled in May 2020, the lawsuit accused Apple of knowingly concealing an alleged flex cable display defect impacting some 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. The judge overseeing the case said that because the defect appeared after the warranty period, Apple was not required to disclose it because it was not a safety issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the lawsuit has been dismissed, the judge is allowing it to be amended. Plaintiffs will need to include an argument that the ‌Flexgate‌ issue was a safety hazard, as well as providing evidence that Apple \"knew with certainty that the alleged defect would occur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌Flexgate‌ problem affected MacBook Pro models released in 2016 and 2017, some of which began exhibiting uneven lighting at the bottom of the screen after a few years. This \"stage light\" effect could lead the backlighting system to fail entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepair site iFixit found that the problem was caused by a delicate flex cable that was prone to wearing out and breaking after repeated opening and closing of the display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple updated the design of the display flex cable with the 2018 MacBook Pro, and launched a free repair program in May 2019 that covered the 13-inch MacBook Pro models from 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe now-dismissed class action lawsuit was seeking restitution for all costs attributable to repairing or replacing affected MacBook Pro models, and it called on Apple to expand the free repair program to cover 15-inch MacBook Pro models.\nTags: lawsuit, Flexgate\nThis article, \"'Flexgate' Class Action Lawsuit Over Faulty MacBook Pro Displays Dismissed by Judge\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The production hub could exceed half a million square feet in size since it needs to provide enough space to produce multiple TV shows and movies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the city's available spaces for production are said to be heavily booked for months in advance by studios that need a constant output of content, prompting companies to acquire space for themselves directly or lock-in locations with leases that reserve the space for several years at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Mosallam joined Apple in January this year as a lead production real-estate executive for Los Angeles, apparently looking to oversee the company's soundstage strategy. He previously worked as Netflix's director of production planning and studio leasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is reportedly hoping to deepen its presence in Hollywood by opening the campus. The company currently leases individual soundstages to film for ‌Apple TV+‌ in Los Angeles and other areas around the world, but a dedicated campus could streamline the production process and reinforce Apple's commitment to compete with other video streaming services.\nTags: wsj.com, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple Looking to Establish a Large Production Campus in Los Angeles for Apple TV+\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "LG has agreed to sell Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches at its \"LG Best Shops\" in South Korea from August, according to a report by the local Herald Economic Daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple products will go on sale at 400 LG stores across the country. As part of the agreement between the two parties, all Macs are excluded from the sales, since LG's laptop offerings overlap with Apple computers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news comes after initial stumbling blocks over the proposed deal appeared to make an agreement unlikely. According to the report, LG faced stiff resistance from the National Mobile Communication Distribution Association, which viewed the proposal as a direct violation of an earlier \"win-win\" competition agreement to do with the sale of mobile phones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, a \"negotiable in case of change\" clause in that agreement has been cited by the regulatory bodies to argue that it is too early to judge whether LG is in violation, given its changed position in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLG Electronics recently announced its withdrawal from the smartphone business, and when it completely withdraws from the mobile business at the end of this month, retail space previously used for marketing its handsets will be vacant. Apple meanwhile saw an opportunity to increase its retail presence in Korea, and the two companies began negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKorea's Distribution Association is reportedly awaiting LG's official statement on the matter while it renegotiates the win-win agreement once it starts selling Apple's products in its stores.\nTags: LG, Korea\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly Agrees to Deal to Sell iPhones in Korean LG Retail Stores From August\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Don't use products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Avoid getting moisture in any opening, and don't submerge your Apple product in any cleaning agents.

With no\noutside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo\nadvertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several\nother things we feel would compromise the product and community\nwe’re trying to build.\nOm: Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional\nphotographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?\nTW: It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be\nanything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone\nwith tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe\ngreat photography can come from anywhere and anyone.

          "description": "Clarifying interview, with at least one bit of news: Federighi says the heretofore unspecified “threshold” for CSAM fingerprint matches that must be reached before an iCloud account is flagged (or even can be flagged, thanks to how the shared-key cryptography is implemented) is “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images”. Right around the 3:00 mark:\n“And if, and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order\nof 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does\nApple know anything about your account and know anything about\nthose images.”\nThere’s also a WSJ news story (News+ link), co-bylined by Stern and Tim Higgins, in which Federighi emphasizes that the database of CSAM fingerprints is auditable:\nBeyond creating a system that isn’t scanning through all of a\nuser’s photos in the cloud, Mr. Federighi pointed to another\nbenefit of placing the matching process on the phone directly.\n“Because it’s on the [phone], security researchers are constantly\nable to introspect what’s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,”\nhe said. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the\nscope of this in some way — in a way that we had committed to not\ndoing — there’s verifiability, they can spot that that’s\nhappening.”\nCritics have said the database of images could be corrupted, such\nas political material being inserted. Apple has pushed back\nagainst that idea. During the interview, Mr. Federighi said the\ndatabase of images is constructed through the intersection of\nimages from multiple child-safety organizations — not just the\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He added that\nat least two “are in distinct jurisdictions.” Such groups and an\nindependent auditor will be able to verify that the database\nconsists only of images provided by those entities, he said.\n ★",

For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.\nFor everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:\nYou know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled\ndocuments open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some\nnotes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s\namazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose\nyour carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,\nbut we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and\neasier: Notes.\nNotes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you\ndon’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you\ndon’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.\nNotes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format\ninvolved. […]\nThere are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits\nyour workflow and style.\nNotes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).\nSee also:\nJason Snell, who wrote a nifty AppleScript that lets him drag an image into a Markdown file in BBEdit 14, and have it (a) upload that file to his server in the background, and (b) insert the Markdown syntax to reference that just-uploaded file.\n\n\nWatts Martin, who has a good overview of where BBEdit 14 stands compared to several popular competing programming text editors.\n\n\n\n\n ★",

It will help limit the risk of transmission at destinations where unvaccinated people travel—and, by setting norms that restrict certain privileges to vaccinated people, will also help raise the stagnant vaccination rates that are keeping both the economy and society from fully recovering.\nFlying is not a right, and the case for restricting it to vaccinated people is straightforward: The federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety. And although air-filtration systems and mask requirements make transmission of the coronavirus unlikely during any given passenger flight, infected people can spread it when they leave the airport and take off their mask.\n ★",

          "description": "Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:\nTensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.\nLess mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.\nGoogle is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone.\n“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google really means it this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.\n ★",

Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:\nMany may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and\ndistancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well\nenough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did\nwhen we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are\nless likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed\nby those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be\nfought and ignored by those who aren’t.\nHospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because\nsomeone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring\nbecause too many people are not immunized.\nThis is why I’ve advocated vaccine mandates. I don’t understand\nhow we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.\nHere’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:\nA year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an\nobviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of\n2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread\nof Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term\nsolution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the\nworld could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.\nNow those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of\nsummer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a\nmask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and\nfederal governments — should consider mandating something else\nfirst: vaccination.\nAsking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work.

If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.\n ★",

          "description": "Federico Viticci, on Twitter:\nThere’s a total of six different touch targets in the iOS 15\nbeta 4 tab bar in Safari.\nThese exclude the ability to long-press the tab bar, swipe across\nit to change tabs, and swipe it up to open the Tabs view.\nI’m … starting to think a single, small toolbar just won’t do. 😬\nI responded that there are actually nine tap targets in the new toolbar in beta 4 — Viticci didn’t count the left / right edges that can be tapped like buttons to switch to the previous / next tabs. That’s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar. (My tweet says eight, but there are two separate tappable areas to bring up the URL address bar, one on each side of the minuscule reload button.)\nApple’s own example in the HIG of a toolbar that’s too crowded has … nine items.\nCurtis Herbert:\nI really do appreciate the experimentation, but the new Safari\nfeels like something I’d take to the UI Design Labs at WWDC and\nthey’d push me to use native controls that users expect and\nalready know, have better tap targets, and stop cramming too many\nthings in a small space.\n ★",

          "description": "On iPhone:\nThe Share button is back in the toolbar, replacing the “···” don’t-call-it-a-hamburger-button. But there’s an awful lot of non-sharing stuff crammed into the Share menu — the ᴀA menu items from the current version of Safari (text size, Reader mode, disabling content blockers temporarily, etc.) are all in “Share” now. It’s better than the “···” menu in betas 1–3, but really, this is more like changing the “···” glyph to the Share glyph. It’s still two menus’ worth of features stuffed into one monolithic menu.\n\n\nThe Reload button is back. But it’s bizarrely tiny — way smaller than the minimum recommended tap target size of 44 x 44 points. And it shares space with the newly restored Reader mode button. When you load a page, if Reader mode is available, the Reader mode button shows briefly (maybe for 1–2 seconds?) along with the text “Reader Available” under the website’s domain name. But then the “Reader Available” label fades out and the Reader mode button turns into the Reload button. To enable Reader mode at this point, you either need to long-press the URL domain name to bring up a shortcut menu, or tap the — you guessed it — Share button, which has its own “Reader” item near the top.\n\n\nBookmarks are supposed to be easier to access, but I think most users accustomed to previous versions of Mobile Safari — which heretofore has always had a bookmarks button right in the main toolbar — are going to struggle to find them.\n\n\n\nApple is clearly trying to address the numerous complaints about the Safari 15 design for iPhone, but beta 4 feels like they’ve decided that the solution to finding themselves in a hole is to dig faster.\n ★",

It was based off two insights:\nPhones were growing in size, and we had opportunity to innovate in creating a gestural, spatial interface that would still be usable with one hand.\n\n\nMobile Chrome was also growing in features — but because its minimalist interface kept everything behind a “three dot” menu, these features were underutilized and hard to access.\n\n\n\nThe idea caught traction internally, eventually becoming a Chrome org priority. […]\nWe heard a mixture of reactions. The feature gained a cult following among the tech community, but for many mainstream users, the change felt disorienting. Chrome serves billions of users around the globe with varying tech literacy. Over the course of many iterations, I became increasingly convinced that launching Chrome Home would not serve all our users well.\nSo just as I strongly as I had pitched the original concept, I advocated for us to stop the launch — which took not a small amount of debate.\nReally curious to see what the next betas of Safari look like on iOS and iPadOS.

[…]\n“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”\nThere’s a lot to roll your eyes at in this brief statement, but the big one is the last clause, implying that Apple’s stance on cloud gaming has anything at all to do with pushing people to buy the “latest and most expensive devices”. Say what you want about Apple’s App Store policies, they go to great lengths to keep older devices relevant for as long as possible — including with their own library of Apple Arcade games.\nWill be interesting to see if these web app games are actually good, and if so, actually become popular.\n ★",

Or continue on  iOS 14  and still get important security updates until you’re ready to upgrade to the next major version.”\nI missed this news last month, and misspoke about it on the latest episode of my podcast, while talking about holding onto iOS 14 indefinitely if Apple doesn’t sufficiently improve the design for Safari in iOS 15.\n ★",

His email:\nYour incessant corona whinery is getting rather long in the tooth,\nbut this disgusting gloating piece takes the cake. Even though it\nprobably is fake Facebook bullshit anyway, to even imply that this\ndisgusting ‘told you so, now you’re dead’ attitude is somehow\ncommendable is just tasteless, and it reflects on you personally\nas you are sharing it.\nUnsubscribed.\nI’m a natural born gloater, I know, but there’s nothing gloating about my posts about COVID and vaccinations. These stories are heartbreaking at the micro level, and infuriating at the macro level. I am sad and I am angry about the state of vaccination denial, and the roles that powerful sources like Fox News and Facebook — neither of which should be trusted by anyone but both of which are trusted by zillions — have played in promoting it.\nYou don’t need any aptitude for numeracy at all to look at numbers like these from Texas to see that if you can get vaccinated for COVID, you should, as soon as possible.

While stressing about it constantly isn’t\nnecessarily helpful, the goal of the Breathable widget is to\nprovide a quick, glanceable answer to a new daily question: Is it\nsafe to go outside?\nBreathable can use AQI data from two services: IQAir.com and,\noptionally, AirNow.gov (in the USA). Both of these services offer\nfree accounts and API access for personal use. Breathable uses the\nUnited States Air Quality Index for all values world-wide.\nThe entire point of Breathable is to offer widgets — the app itself just lets you configure how the widgets look. Brilliantly simple, and in a way, fun, with its clever “emoji scale”. I started using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but only because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather app — Philadelphia generally doesn’t have air quality issues. I should have known better. Turns out, the whole world now has air quality issues.\nBreathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the proceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.\n ★",

So we\nshould act like it.\nFDA formal approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn’t the entirety of his argument, but it comes first because it’s so obvious.

A common reason to do so is to inform the user that they\nhave made changes to the document which they might wish to save\nbefore closing the window.\nWhen your application uses proxy icons, it should inform the\nWindow Manager when a document has unsaved changes. When you do\nso, the Window Manager displays the document’s proxy icon in a\ndisabled state and prevents the user from dragging the proxy icon.\nDisabled proxy icons cannot be dragged because unsaved documents\ncannot be moved or copied in a manner predictable to the user.\nFigure 1-3 shows a proxy icon in a document window with unsaved\nchanges.\nKatz tweeted::\n@gruber I found this Mac OS 8.5 proxy icon documentation a great\nread.

On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.\nIn addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.\nSenior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year. It has yet to release for current generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, where it is only playable in compatibility mode.\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.

That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.\nBehaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.\nThat’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.\nBehaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.\nDead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.",

On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.\nFirst, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. \n\n\nSecond, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.\n\n\nFinally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.\n“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”\nMonday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way. CD Projekt promises more details on Aug. 17 during a live Twitch stream.\nCyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.",

Wavelengths is a DLC addition to True Colors, and it doesn’t seem to touch at all on the main mystery of Gabe Chen. Instead, we’re in the shoes of Steph, a young DJ who’s looking to make a mark in the world. Steph’s story plays out over four seasons, and we get to find out more about her and her life before we head into the main plot.\nTrue Colors stars Alex Chen, a young woman who moves to a new city and ends up investigating the death of her brother. Alex is accompanied on her investigation by a supporting cast, which includes Steph, who also showed up in Before the Storm. Wavelengths gives us a little more background on who Steph is, and that may influence the choices players make throughout the story of True Colors.\nThe soundtrack includes songs from Girl in Red, Alt-J, Portugal, The Man, Foals, Hayley Kiyoko, and Maribou State. As Steph becomes more comfortable as a DJ, the player gets to see other aspects of her life. This includes running a D&D game with a friend, using the D20 to give callers advice on the radio, and swiping left or right on profiles during Pride month. \nThe entire DLC looks incredibly cozy, and it’ll be interesting to see how it adds to the main story. True Colors is set to be released on Sept. 10; Wavelengths will release soon after on Sept. 30.",

Now that the Sentinels of Light have put down the Ruined King and saved the world, things should be pretty peaceful, right? Well, the event left a lot of loose threads hanging, like the fate of characters like Karma, Shyvana, or Thresh. On Thursday, Riot released a new cinematic that answers at least a few of those questions.\nThe cinematic stars Thresh, who is a spectral warden from the Shadow Isles. In the Sentinels of Light event, he gathered up all of the power from Viego’s scary invasion and used it to craft himself a different form. With this new, mostly human form, Thresh is free to wander the world. This cinematic is an immediate follow-up that shows us what he’s doing with his freedom, and it’s nothing good! He’s back to shackling and torturing souls inside his scary lantern, but at least he’s appointing middle management to help out. In this case, that’s an unfortunate tavern keep called Bort with a crab claw for an arm.\nThis cinematic also shows Thresh in a different light than his in-game splash art. Instead of having his sick abs out for everyone to admire, he appears much more sinister and skeletal in this one. Even when he’s just in the tavern, pretending to be a normal guy, you can tell there’s something off there. It’s a great rendition of the character, and it’ll be intriguing to see where his story leads.",

This remains unconfirmed, but the remastered version of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are rumored to arrive on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and mobile devices.\nKotaku’s report suggests that the games will be “a mix of new and old graphics,” akin to a “heavily-modded version of a classic GTA title.” The UI of the games will be updated for clarity as well, though it’ll remain the classic visual style. Gameplay is expected to remain as close as possible to the original iterations.\nThese three titles are part of the “3D universe” of Rockstar Games, which include the PS2 era of Grand Theft Auto before the series moved into high definition with Grand Theft Auto 4. While these games aren’t quite as fleshed out or involved as Rockstar’s modern titles, they still remain classics. Lines from San Andreas, like CJ’s iconic “Ah, shit, here we go again,” remain a popular part of the zeitgeist.\nKotaku says Rockstar Dundee, a Scottish studio, is heading up development on these remastered titles. It’s unclear when they might be released, especially due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it seems as though it will likely be in one bundle.\nRockstar also reportedly has plans for a Red Dead Redemption remaster.\nWe’ve reached out to Rockstar for comment, and will update this story should it respond with additional information.",

Williams returns as ‘Irish’ from Battlefield 4\n Battlefield 2042 won’t feature a traditional narrative single-player campaign, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carry over storytelling elements from previous games — or that it won’t tell stories of its own. In a newly released short film titled “Exodus,” developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts set up the story of Battlefield 2042 and confirm the return of a beloved character: Battlefield 4’s Kimble “Irish” Graves, once again played by Michael K. Williams.\nThe nine-minute film appears to confirm a canonical ending for 2013’s Battlefield 4: that Irish, not Huang “Hannah” Shuyi, survives the events of that game’s campaign. As such, Irish will be a playable “No-Pat” Specialist in Battlefield 2042. \n“Exodus” also introduces a new character to Battlefield lore named Oz. He clashes with Irish over the future of the No-Pats — 2042’s nickname for the non-patriated soldiers who fight in the upcoming game’s global conflict. EA said in a news released that the story of Battlefield 2042 will “continue to evolve over time” and will be told through future playable specialists — not unlike how EA’s Apex Legends or Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch handle their storytelling.\nIrish is the fifth confirmed specialist coming in Battlefield 2042, following Casper, Mackay, Boris, and Falck, who were revealed in June. Battlefield 2042 is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.",

Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards.

In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.\nIt also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her.

Metal Slug Tactics is all about approaching fights strategically and placing your troops in the correct positions for special bonuses. The game also adds roguelike elements to help keep each run fresh. \nBut not everything about Metal Slug Tactics is new. The game still keeps the pixel-art graphics fans are used to from the Metal Slug franchise, along with some of its characters like Marco, Tarma, Fio, and Eri.

It’s the Dragonborn. \nThanks to a new mod that adds Link’s paraglider from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Skyrim, you can now float across the land just like the hero of time would. The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. \nThe “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. \nIn the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.\nSimilar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. \nThe mod doesn't add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!",

State Farm and Coca Cola are two of the League’s seven sponsors listed on their website, along with IBM, Xfinity, Cheez-It, Pringles, and TeamSpeak.\nBrand deals are one of the ways to measure success for a competitive ecosystem like the Overwatch League. The League lost T-Mobile as a sponsor on Tuesday, and it appears as though others may soon follow.\nIn a statement to the Post, a representative of State Farm said that the insurance provider was “reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League” and the company has requested that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.” A spokesperson for Coca-Cola shared a similar sentiment, saying that the company is “aware of the allegations” and are working to “take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.”\nJ. Allen Brack, the head of Blizzard Entertainment, stepped down from his position on Tuesday, with Jen ONeal and Mike Ybarra taking his place as co-leaders. Jesse Meschuk, SVP and senior people officer at Activision-Blizzard, also reportedly left the company this week.

This update will roll out free to those who already own Art of Rally on PC, and be included in the new console versions at their launch on Aug. 12.\nFunselektor said back in May that it expects a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5 release this summer also, but it does not yet have a launch date to share.\nThe Kenya Update adds four new cars, two new songs, six more stages with locations referencing Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, a free-roaming map set in the Kenya environment, and even local wildlife. Zebras, giraffes, and elephants will highlight the wide-open savanna.\nArt of Rally launched Sept. 23, 2020 on Windows PC and MacOs via Steam. It’s a semi-top down (mostly isometric, though the camera can be changed) approach to rally/road racing, and Funselektor has created an homage to the great FIA competition groups of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including the gloriously reckless Group B of 1982 to 1987. Art of Rally’s cars are all fictitious, but they’re very well done homages to the recognizable chassis of their times. (My favorite is the German-engineered Das Whip.)",

The game was previously scheduled to launch at the end of August, but the new release date is Sept. 28, 2021. \nThis is the most recent of multiple delays for the game. “We know that this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer,” the developers said. “But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.” The team cited feedback from the closed beta as a factor in pushing back the game. \nYou can read the full statement on New World’s Twitter page here.\nA message from the New World team. pic.twitter.com/oAZdK7dxTn\n— New World (@playnewworld) August 4, 2021\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned delays started in April, where the studio cited problems created by the coronavirus lockdowns. In July 2020, the studio announced that the game would be delayed to spring 2021. Then, in February 2021, the studio delayed it once more to August, 2021. The original target date was May, 2020. \nNew World is an MMO where you’re tasked with colonizing a fictional landmass in the Atlantic. The game features 50-on-50 fights where entire groups clash to take the land. Amazon previously hosted a preview event with thousands of players to gather feedback. Then, it became a chaotic attempt to simulate mid-1600s war. \nNew World is one of three PC games announced by Amazon Game Studios at TwitchCon 2016. However, delays and cancellations have impacted all three titles. Their multiplayer brawler Breakaway was canceled during development. Their other title, Crucible launched in May 2020, only for the studio to un-release the game and bring it back into a closed beta. The team later ceased development of Crucible in October.",

Capcom promises to reveal more details about Luke before his release in November.\nTwo other fighters are coming to Street Fighter 5 sooner: Oro from Street Fighter 3 and Akira Kazama from Capcom’s Rival Schools series will be released as paid DLC on Aug. 16. You can get an in-depth look at those new DLC fighters in Capcom’s Street Fighter 5 summer update video below.\n\n\nThose three DLC characters are included in Street Fighter 5’s season 5 pass, and each one can be purchased separately for MSRP $5.99 or 100,000 Fight Money, SF5’s earnable in-game currency.\nLuke “will help expand the world of Street Fighter and provide fans with a glimpse into the future,” Capcom teased in a news release. That’s likely a reference to the next Street Fighter, which is reportedly due sometime in 2022, based on details leaked from a ransomware attack on Capcom in 2020. That leak outed references to Street Fighter 6 arriving in the third quarter of 2022, followed by Super Street Fighter 6 and Ultra Street Fighter 6 in the years following. Capcom has not officially announced any of those projects, and plans may have changed since then.\nThe latest version of Capcom’s flagship fighting game series, Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.",

On top of that, it’s even possible that this new broadcast signal could be teasing some kind of mind-control Killstreak, but we’ll have to wait for more information to find out. \nWith season 5 on the way soon, Treyarch and Raven Software will probably tease new features over the next several days before everything is revealed early next week.",

A new update adds a new car, two new tracks, and streets filled with zombies (and zombie cows) to plow through. Wreckfest’s latest tournament borrows its visuals from the original Carmageddon, a pixelated mess by modern standards, which gives it a sense of charm.\nWreckfest players will be able to race through two vintage Carmageddon tracks (Bleak City and Death Canyon) and ride in the sawblade-adorned Eagle R car, which appeared in 2016’s Carmageddon: Max Damage.\nThe action is certainly less sadistic than the original Carmageddon, which awarded players bonus points for running over innocent pedestrians. Wreckfest’s version of vehicular homicide is more about cleaning up the streets of undead, with palatable splashes of green, pixelated blood splashing across the screen.\nWreckfest is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. We called its brand of destruction-filled racing some of the most fun we had in 2019. The Carmageddon series kicked off in 1997, with Stainless Games’ original game for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows PC.

Monday’s announcement said Containment is “inspired by the upcoming game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction,” which was re-titled from Rainbow Six Quarantine during an E3 2021 reveal in June.\nContainment will take place on a reworked version of the Consulate map. In-game, the building is overrun by the Chimera parasite, whose outbreak forms the narrative context of Extraction. It was also the basis of Operation Chimera, an expansion for Siege that launched in 2018, which introduced a cooperative event called Outbreak.\nContainment’s new playlist is called Nest Destruction. Players will get a look at REACT, the faction that will be doing most of the cleanup in Extraction. In Nest Destruction, the Attackers are REACT agents (a news release in July said Rainbow operators Ash, Mira, and Thermite formed this squad). The Defenders are alien shapeshifters who look like REACT teammates, but can only use melee attacks. Attackers are there to destroy the nest, Defenders are there to destroy the Attackers.\nContainment will offer 33 unique items, including uniforms and weapon skins, for operators IQ, Ace, Blackbeard, Amaru, Zero, Aruni, Jager, Kaid, Mira, and Warden. These items are available in Siege’s shop for 1680 R6 credits, or in Containment Packs that run 300 R6 credits or 12,500 renown.\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally expected to launch Sept. 16, but in mid-July, Ubisoft announced it was postponing that release until January 2022. Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions on Amazon Luna and Google Stadia.",

The cat-centric gameplay looks impressively authentic; as the titular stray cat, you’ll knock things over to solve puzzles and create new pathways, leap through a strange city with feline grace, and claw up furniture because you despise humans’ material investments.\nMost of what you’ll do in Stray draws upon the real-world abilities of a cat. But you also have a helpful companion, a drone named B-12, who offers other gifts. B-12 will helpfully interact with objects in the world and communicate with the city’s robotic inhabitants. The cat will also have to avoid danger from rat-like creatures, but with the help of B-12, it appears the cat can turn the tables and kill them en masse with a purple light.\nThe cat can also very believably lick its butt, as seen in the GIF below.\nStray is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC sometime in early 2022.",

Solar Ash is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.\nHeart Machine first revealed Solar Ash in 2019 (as Solar Ash Kingdom). Players take on the role of Rei, a Voidrunner who will journey through a colorful, stylized world as she fights to save her planet from the Ultravoid. The developer promises fluid controls, with rail-grinding, grappling, and cloud surfing. \n“Solar Ash is Heart Machine’s vision of the adventure platformer,” game designer Alx Preston said of Solar Ash earlier this year. “The giant spaces, the feel of movement, the flow of combat, and the high stakes battles atop enormous beasts all come together to bring players something we think is incredibly unique, and more importantly, fun.”\nIn our review of the developer’s Hyper Light Drifter, we praised the top-down action game for its combination of story and gameplay: “It replaces traditional narrative structures with moods, but punctuates those contemplative, quiet moments with constant scenes of breakneck, pitch-perfect action. Getting those two elements to not only coexist but thrive together is a needle that Hyper Light Drifter confidently threads.”",

The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.\nIt started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. \nSome held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. \nAs it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.\nPolygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.",

His hair, beard, and eyebrows eat up another 3.5 million.\nIn another demo, The Coalition showcases the real-time lighting and reflection technology, called Lumen, in Unreal Engine 5, and Nanite, “which allows for unlimited triangle budget.” Epic Games announced those UE5 features in May 2020, as part of a showcase of the game engine running on PlayStation 5 hardware, but here’s another sun-baked, particle-rich, and glowing-mirrored-obelisk look at the graphics tech in action:\n\n\nThe Coalition announced in May that it was winding down development on Gears of War 5, and shifting to new, unannounced projects using Unreal Engine 5. The Coalition said it will be developing with UE5 “for multiple new projects in the coming years.”\nEpic announced Unreal Engine 5 last year, and made the technology available in preview form in early 2021. A full release is slated for late 2021. Unreal Engine 5 will be available for both current-generation and last-generation consoles, as well as Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows PC. UE5 is being developed with forward compatibility in mind, Epic says, letting developers create games in Unreal Engine 4 and move them to the next-generation engine later.\nFor a full look at The Coalition’s Unreal Engine 5 tech demos, check out the developer’s hourlong GDC 2021 presentation on YouTube.",

          "description": "Image: Respawn Entertainment/EA Games\n    \n\n  \nTrailer shows off Seer and the new Rampage gun\n World’s Edge is getting a massive makeover in Apex Legends’ newest season. Respawn Entertainment released a trailer on Monday to show off the newly destroyed version of the map along with some of the other features of the Apex Legends season 10: Emergence, including Seer, the game’s new Legend, and the new Rampage weapon.\nWorld’s Edge was already filled with the lava and all sorts of other hazards, but the new “decimated” version of the map seems to make it more treacherous than ever. Lava is expanding into new parts of the map, as buildings and terrain are destroyed by some kind of calamity. In one of the earlier trailers, there’s even an avalanche of some kind for players to outrun. The trailer only gives quick glimpses of areas of the map, but it seems like large portions will be totally changed when the new season is released. \nThe new map update isn’t the only change that Respawn is bringing with season 10 either. Seer already seems like one of the game’s most exciting Legends and he gets another spotlight in this trailer. We see him shooting down enemies as well as tracking them with his various nanotech abilities, including his Ultimate, which places a dome over a small area of the map and tracks anyone moving quickly inside. \nThe Emergence update will also include a new weapon called Rampage, which seems to be a slow-firing but very powerful rifle. Of course, there will also be a battle pass to go along with the new season that includes character and weapon skins for players to unlock as they play. \nApex Legends season 10 and all of its additions are set to go live on Aug. 3.",

Other arenas included a castle and a strange, larger-than-life-size child’s bedroom.\nKnockout City launched May 25 on all current platforms except for mobile devices. The full game is free for anyone to play, up to Street Rank 25, which is a good six or so hours of progression. That’s partly why the new game has been able to draw an audience of about 5 million players so far.\nThe game is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC via Steam and Origin, Xbox One and Xbox Series X. All versions are cross-play and cross-progression compatible.",

They can also be pretty big, like raising the height limit for settlements, building CAMPs in previously restricted places, summoning big monsters, or jumping as high as you like.\nThe Fallout Worlds update will add two modes to Fallout 76: Public Worlds and Custom Worlds. Public Worlds are a rotating series of custom servers available to all players. These are fun, wacky, curated experiences. Fallout 1st subscribers will be able to create their own Custom Worlds and invite their friends over (including ones without a subscription).\nAs of Tuesday, Fallout Worlds is available for testing on Fallout 76’s public test server, and Bethesda said it will continue to add new sliders, options, and abilities in the future.

In Mini Motorways, the player is tasked with setting up their own little cities. Automated civilians build their own houses and little car parks, and the player has to be the civic planner who links it all together. Ideally, they achieve this by creating an efficient little system of roads and paths to connect the city. However, nothing is stopping anyone from building a nightmare city in which every road is as ridiculous as possible.\nMini Motorways is an excellent chill-out game, and there’s enough variety to keep things interesting. Players can choose between different cities: Los Angeles, Beijing, Tokyo, Dar es Salaam, Moscow, and Munich. The game is colorful and minimalistic enough to have a very Zen garden feeling to it.\nIf you have an iOS phone, it might be worth giving Mini Motorways a look on there, because the Apple Arcade version is receiving an update called Round Trip.

          "description": "Image: Digital Extremes\n    \n\n  \nThe enemy of my enemy is my friend\n Warframe’s main quest and biggest antagonists will return to the game later this year with the release of a new content expansion, The New War. \nLore-wise, The New War is a continuation of an ancient conflict between a group of AI known as the Sentients and the player-controlled space ninjas known as Tenno.\nFor the first time, however, players won’t be flipping and dodging in their usual Warframes. Instead, players can take the role of characters from around the Origin System who usually don’t get the spotlight. Grineer Soldier Kahl-175, Corpus Engineer Veso, and long-time NPC ally Teshin all showed up as playable characters in an upcoming New War quest.\n\n\nDuring TennoCon, players could watch the digital stream on Twitch or show up in game and go to a special Relay. There, Digital Extremes loaded in scenes and moments from the story so far to help remind everyone what The New War is about. It’s hard to explain much without going into spoilers, but fans are excited because this story has been building for years. Everyone wants to see what happens to characters like Lotus, aka Space Mom.\nThe New War will come out later this year, along with cross-progression and cross-play across all consoles.",

          "description": "Image: Ubisoft\n    \n\n  \nXDefiant brings together the Splinter Cell, Division, and Ghost Recon series\n Ubisoft is making a new free-to-play shooter set in the Tom Clancyverse called Tom Clancy’s XDefiant. It’s pitched as a “high-octane,” 6v6 multiplayer first-person arena shooter — it’s “fast-paced firefights meets punk-rock moshpit,” said XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin and creative director Jason Schroeder in a reveal video.\nDeveloped by Ubisoft San Francisco, Tom Clancy’s XDefiant promises realistic gunplay with personalized classes, represented as factions with special abilities. Those factions (Echelon, Outcasts, Cleaners, and Wolves) are inspired by other Tom Clancy games, like the Splinter Cell, The Division, and Ghost Recon series.\nOn top of deep personalization and customization, gunplay is a “top priority,” Rubin said. XDefiant will feature “an ever-growing arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments,” Rubin explained, boasting that Ubisoft San Francisco is crafting “every weapon attachment for precise, satisfying gunplay.”\nAn early gameplay test for Tom Clancy’s XDefiant will launch Aug. 5. Interested players can register at the game’s official website. The game is still early in development, its creators said, adding that “your feedback is essential to make this game great.” Schroeder said that Ubisoft plans to add to the game’s “diverse cast” with new characters, and Rubin said that Ubi SF is “committed to creating a welcoming game based on fair play and transparency.”\nTom Clancy’s XDefiant is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions for Amazon Luna and Google Stadia. Ubisoft promises cross-platform play. XDefiant was previously outed as Battlecat, back in June.",

The latest of Apex’s always-excellent Stories from the Outlands cinematics tells the tale of Seer, a child with cursed, glowing eyes, and the next Legend to join the Apex Games.\nAccording to the trailer, Seer’s eyes are more than just a piercing blue: They’re also so special they can reduce kings to beggars and oceans to deserts, whatever that means in the context of a battle royale game. While it’s not totally clear what his abilities will be just yet, his description in the season preview on the Apex Legends website may offer some clues: \nWith microdrones and an artist’s eye, Seer spots opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seizes them in the most beautiful way he can.\n\nWhatever his powers are it seems that he’ll feature plenty of style and maybe even have a few unique, hat-themed skins — which is exciting, because Apex currently has a distinct lack of good hats. \nAnother change coming to Apex Legends in the new season, which is called Emergence, is the new Rampage light machine gun and the arrival of Ranked mode for Arenas. This season will also include some major changes to the World’s Edge map, but we’ll have to wait until EA Play Live on July 22 to find out exactly what those changes will be, as well as what else Emergence will have in store. \nApex Legends’ new Emergence season will be available starting on Aug. 3 for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

The retailer will restock over 100 stores with a small supply of GeForce RTX 30-series cards on July 20. While Best Buy didn’t clarify which cards in the RTX 30-series will be available, some stores will likely have RTX 3060s, RTX 3070s, and RTX 3080s in stock.\nOn Tuesday morning, fans can line up in front of their local Best Buys in hopes of grabbing a ticket from an employee. Starting at 7:30 a.m. in that store’s time zone, Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer until they run out. The ticket guarantees the recipient an opportunity to buy an RTX 30-series card. A retail priced RTX 3060 can run players around $329, while the more powerful RTX 3080 cards go for $699. The middle card, the RTX 3070, will run players $499. \nBuyers likely won’t know which cards Best Buy has in stock until employees start handing out tickets.

During the event, the developer shared some previews of upcoming content, but the biggest change I’m excited for takes place under the hood. Cross-save, cross-progression, and cross-play are coming to the game, as well as a new mobile version.\nAll future updates, including the upcoming The New War, will now launch simultaneously across all consoles. Warframe is currently available for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.\n\n\nThis is, needless to say, a huge benefit to people who have sunk a ton of time into Warframe. I have about 1,000 hours on my main account, which means I could never get into a console version of the game. How could I give up my guns, gear, and frames? Now, I don’t have to make such a brutal choice. I’ll be able to play Warframe in bed on the Switch, which is the best possible change.\nThere is currently no launch date for Warframe on mobile devices; the port is “actively in development,” Digital Extremes said. We’ll likely learn more about cross-play and cross-progression as we get closer to The New War expansion, which is planned for a 2021 release.",

A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”\n\n\nYou can follow Wick’s continuing photo adventures on Instagram.\nTags: Alan Taylor   Bob Wick   photography",

          "description": "In The Hidden Melodies of Subways Around the World, the NY Times takes a look at an often overlooked aspect of transit design: the door closing sounds on the subway. My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: \nIn Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”\nIn Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)\n\n\nYou can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.\nTags: audio   cities   music   subway   Ted Green",

          "description": "For The Atlantic, Katherine Wu writes about the difficulty of communicating how vaccines work and how they protect individuals and communities from disease: Vaccines Are Like Sunscreen… No, Wait, Airbags… No, Wait…\nUnfortunately, communal benefit is harder to define, harder to quantify, and harder to describe than individual protection, because “it’s not the way Americans are used to thinking about things,” Neil Lewis, a behavioral scientist and communications expert at Cornell, told me. That’s in part because communal risk isn’t characteristic of the health perils people in wealthy countries are accustomed to facing: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer. Maybe that’s part of why we gravitate toward individual-focused comparisons. Slipping into a pandemic-compatible, population-based frame of mind is a big shift. In the age of COVID-19, “there’s been a lot of focus on the individual,” Lewis told me. That’s pretty at odds “with how infection works.”\n\n\nAs someone who has struggled with analogizing the virus & vaccines, I was nodding my head a lot while reading this. Something I’ve noticed in recent years that Wu didn’t get into is that readers desire precision in metaphors and analogies, even though metaphor is — by definition! — not supposed to be taken literally. People seem much more interested in taking analogies apart, identifying what doesn’t work, and discarding them rather than — more generously and constructively IMO — using them as the author intended to better understand the subject matter. The perfect metaphor doesn’t exist because then it wouldn’t be a metaphor.\nTags: Covid-19   Katherine Wu   language   medicine   science   vaccines",

          "description": "In an issue of his newsletter, The Convivial Society, L.M. Sacasas posed 41 questions that we should ask ourselves about technologies to help us “draw out the moral or ethical implications of our tools”. Here are a few of the questions:\n3. How will the use of this technology affect my experience of time?\n\n\nSacasas recently joined Ezra Klein on his podcast to talk through some of the answers to these questions for certain technologies.\nEZRA KLEIN: I’m gonna group the next set together. So what was required of other human beings, of other creatures, of the earth, so that I might be able to use this technology? When you ask that, when you think of that, what comes to mind?\nMICHAEL SACASAS: So I recently wrote a piece, and its premise was that sometimes we think of the internet, of digital life, as being immaterial, existing somewhere out in the ether, in the cloud, with these metaphors that kind of suggest that it doesn’t really have a material footprint. But the reality of course — I think as most of us are becoming very aware — is that it very much has a material reality that may begin in a mine where rare earth metals are being extracted in inhumane working conditions at great cost to the local environment.\nBut that’s very far removed from my comfortable experience of the tablet on my couch in the living room. And so with regards to the earth, the digital realm depends upon material resources that need to be collected. It depends on the energy grid. It leaves a footprint on the environment.\nAnd so we tend not to think about that by the time that it gets to us and looks so shiny and clean and new, and connects us to this world that isn’t physically necessarily located anywhere in our experience. And so I think it is important for us to think about the labor, the extraction cost on the environment, that go into providing us with the kind of world that we find so amusing and interesting and comfortable.\n\n\n Tags: Ezra Klein   L.M.

          "description": "One of the many effects of human-driven climate change is that, on average, the bodies of animals are getting smaller — birds, fish, deer, frogs, rodents, insects. And these changes could have large and unpredictable consequences.\n“That’s the problem with human-driven climate change. It’s the rate of change that’s just orders of magnitude faster than what the natural world has had to deal with in the past. Size is really important to survival, and you can’t just change that indefinitely without consequence. For one thing, I don’t think it’s feasible that species are going to be able to continue to get smaller and maintain things like a migration from one hemisphere to another.”\nAnd since smaller bodies can hold fewer eggs, they result in fewer offspring, and a lower population size in the long run. For amphibians who need to keep their skin wet in order to breathe, shrinking can mean higher chances of drying out in a drought because their bodies absorb and hold smaller quantities of water.\nBut the more concerning consequences have to do with how this could destabilize relationships between species. Because shrinking plays out at different rates for different species, predators might have to eat more and more of shrinking prey, for example, throwing a finely-tuned ecosystem off balance.\n\n\n Tags: global warming   science   video",

Imagine that you’re all at the top of a mountain, she told them, but you all have broken bones, so you can’t help each other. You each have to find your own way down.\nIt was a helpful metaphor, one that may have saved the McIlvaines’ marriage.

This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.\n3. Stress Tolerance. This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.\n\n\nThey also identified four types of curious people: The Fascinated, Problem Solvers, Empathizers, and Avoiders.

          "description": "In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.\nCognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.\nThe power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.\n\n\nI particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:\nDaily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.\n\n\nFor more information on how caffeine enabled the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, check out Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses.\nTags: books   drugs   Michael Pollan   This Is Your Mind on Plants",

It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.\nAnton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.\nSteven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.\n\n\n Tags: Tim Harford",

For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.\n“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”\n\n\nArmanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:\nThose distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”\n\n\n(thx, pete)\nTags: 2020 Summer Olympics   Lizzie Armanto   Nathan Fitch   Olympic Games   skateboarding   sports   video",

In contrast to things like planets or stars they have no physical size limit, and can literally grow endlessly.

In a review of Angie Schmitt’s 2020 book Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America for the New York Review of Books, Peter Baker explores why America is increasingly hostile to pedestrians. Part of the reason is the rise of SUVs (and one would assume, trucks) in the US:\nIn the 1980s SUVs were a rarity. It was only in 2015 that they started outselling sedans.

I remember coming home from school that day and watching the events unfold on television, completely shocked at how quickly it had all happened. Politics & protests had been pushing the Eastern Bloc countries toward more openness for years, but before watching this video, I’d never heard that the catalyst for that world-changing event was a short mistaken statement at the end of an otherwise boring press conference. From the BBC:\nEast German leaders had tried to calm mounting protests by loosening the borders, making travel easier for East Germans. They had not intended to open the border up completely.\nThe changes were meant to be fairly minor — but the way they were delivered had major consequences.\nNotes about the new rules were handed to a spokesman, Günter Schabowski — who had no time to read them before his regular press conference. When he read the note aloud for the first time, reporters were stunned.\n“Private travel outside the country can now be applied for without prerequisites,” he said. Surprised journalists clamoured for more details.\nShuffling through his notes, Mr Schabowski said that as far as he was aware, it was effective immediately.\nIn fact it had been planned to start the next day, with details on applying for a visa.\nBut the news was all over television — and East Germans flocked to the border in huge numbers.\n\n\nHow did the Berlin Wall fall? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\nTags: Berlin Wall   Cold War   Germany   politics   video",

The canoe is usually leaned over to the side to help the boat turn sharply and efficiently and paddle strokes are taken on either side of the canoe depending on the individual move. Balance, paddle placement and turn initiation are a few keys to this control. Since the movements seem dance-like, some practice this art timed to music, which is the ultimate in control.\n\n\nThe vest & bow tie, the choice of music (The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh), his control of the canoe — it’s all perfect.\nSee also It’s Reflective Fjord Season, Watch As a Master Woodworker Turns a Giant Log into an Elegant Dugout Canoe, and Kayaking Down a Drainage Ditch.

The ladles pour the molten metal into these molds. Once the metal is poured and cooled, the sand molds get placed into a shake-out machine that shakes the sand away from the pan, and then into an enormous drum to shake off the rest. The pans are finally put on a giant conveyor belt to be sorted and inspected. Any pans that are not up to muster get thrown back into the original scrap heap to be melted down again and remade into another pan.\n\n\nIn comparison, here’s how Borough Furnace makes their cast iron pans by hand in their much smaller workshop:\n\nVery similar process, down to the sand molds, just on a much smaller and more hands-on scale.\nTags: cooking   how to   video",

          "description": "Before this morning, I had never heard of Lusia Harris and now she’s one of my favorite basketball players. Playing in the 1970s, before the enforcement of Title IX in athletics, the 6’3” Harris dominated in high school, led a small university to three consecutive national basketball championships in the first 5 years of the program (while averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds per game), scored the first basket in Olympics women’s basketball history, is the only woman ever officially drafted by an NBA team, and was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. And those aren’t even her proudest achievements — you’ll have to watch the video for that.\nFor an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals — but Harris’s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot’s “The Queen of Basketball,” Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.\n\n\nThis video is part of the NY Times’ Almost Famous series, which also includes stories about radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell and actress/singer Kim Hill.\nTags: basketball   Ben Proudfoot   Lusia Harris   sports   video",

          "description": "This is fantastic: for more than 60 years beginning in 1899, Lora Webb Nichols captured and collected about 24,000 photographs of life in a small copper-mining town in Wyoming.\nOn October 28, 1899, Lora Webb Nichols was at her family’s homestead, near Encampment, Wyoming, reading “Five Little Peppers Midway,” when her beau, Bert Oldman, came to the door to deliver a birthday present. The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.\n\n\nYou can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.\nTags: Lora Webb Nichols   photography",

The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:\nThis was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.\n\n\nAfter more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now. When the rest of the world is teeming with the virus, it becomes more likely over time that even the most organized and protected systems are going to be vulnerable.\nTags: Covid-19   Ed Ou   Taiwan   video",

          "description": "Using dozens of bot accounts, The Wall Street Journal did an investigation and determined that TikTok’s algorithm needs only one piece of information to determine what you want to watch: the amount of time you spend watching individual videos. Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.\nAs someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.\nTags: TikTok   video",

In 1967, while she was working on her doctoral research with her advisor Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell Burnell (then Jocelyn Bell) discovered a new and unusual kind of object, the pulsar. In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.\nIn 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.\nIt’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.\nTags: Antony Hewish   astronomy   Ben Proudfoot   Jocelyn Bell Burnell   Nobel Prize   physics   science   sexism",

          "description": "For Vox, Emily Stewart writes about the shortcomings of the, er, system we’ve developed here in America of outsourcing public needs to private industry: Corporations aren’t going to save America.\nAcross various segments of American life, the private sector has begun to take on tasks big and small that one might think should be tackled by the public sector. Domino’s filled in potholes. Dawn’s dish soap saved ducks. American Express pitched in on historic preservation. Walmart started selling low-priced insulin. A slew of companies help workers pay for school. Much of America’s health care system is still handled through private insurers and your job. As people lose faith in government to act on sweeping issues such as climate change and guns, they’re increasingly looking to corporate America and asking whether there’s something they can do about it. If Congress won’t tackle gun violence, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods can try.\nIt’s not a bad thing for brands and companies to try to make the world better. Starting a business often involves identifying a problem to solve, and it’s much better for companies to help than to do harm. Corporate social responsibility is fine. There are, however, limits.\n“Of course we want businesses to be responsible,” said Suzanne Kahn, managing director of research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. But she emphasized that this does not constitute a plan for how to organize society. “Private companies don’t, can’t, or won’t plan with the same values that we demand and expect the government to.”\n\n\n(via the morning news)\nTags: business   Emily Stewart   USA",

Their latest endeavor takes place in NYC, perhaps the best place on Earth for exposing random strangers to positive pranks. A man in an orange vest places a “Stand Here for Dance Party” sign on the ground and then walks away. A brave soul steps onto the sign and, well, you might guess what happens next.\nI found this via Rob Walker’s newsletter about his book, The Art of Noticing. I love what he wrote about it:\nNow that you’ve seen it, you know that once someone did stand on the decal, a squad of Improv Everywhere operatives, with boom boxes and impressive dance moves, converted the public space into (as promised) an open-air dance party. Very fun.\nBut here’s what makes this work: Not just the planning and the expert performers and the slick choreography and the clever subversion of social-distance design. None of that matters unless somebody stands on the decal. What activates this entire operation is curiosity.\n\n\nHe continues, describing the woman who gets the party started:\nThis woman is my hero! I love everything about her, her body language, her openness, the thrilling sense she radiates that anything could happen and she’s up for it. And if you’ve watched the video, you know that she in fact unleashed an experience that she (and many strangers nearby) will never forget.\nWhat’s not in the video, but we know is true, is some huge majority of people not even noticing, or actively ignoring, the invitation to an impromptu, on-the-spot dance party. As always, attention is the first step.\n\n\nCuriosity. Attention. There are those words again, the universe trying to tell me something.\nTags: dance   Improv Everywhere   NYC   Rob Walker   video",

          "description": "This piece by Wright Thompson on how the murder of Emmett Till has been remembered and forgotten is a difficult, compelling, and important read. The story centers around the still-little-known barn where Till was tortured and murdered by a group of several white men in 1955.\nBut the way Till’s name exists in the firmament of American history stands in opposition to the gaps in what we know about his killing. No one knows, for instance, how many people were involved. Most historians think at least seven were present. Only two were tried: half brothers J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Another half brother, Leslie Milam, was there that night too. He lived in an old white farmhouse a few dozen steps from the barn, next to where Jeff Andrews’s house now stands.\nIn 1955 an all-white, all-male jury, encouraged by the defense to do their duty as “Anglo-Saxons,” acquitted J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Because the defendants couldn’t be tried again, they got paid to make a confession to a national magazine — a heavily fictionalized account stage-managed by their lawyers — and Leslie Milam and his barn were written out of the story. Ask most people where Till died and they’ll say Money, Mississippi, the town where Till whistled at Bryant’s wife outside the family’s store. An Equal Justice Initiative monument in Montgomery says Money. Wikipedia does too. The Library of Congress website skips over the barn, which is just outside the town of Drew, about 45 minutes from the store.\nI learned about the barn last year and have since made repeated visits, alone and with groups, once with members of Till’s family. Over and over, I drove from my home in the Mississippi hill country back into the gothic flatland where I was born. The barn’s existence conjures a complex set of reactions: It is a mourning bench for Black Americans, an unwelcome mirror for white Americans. It both repels and demands attention.\n\n\n Tags: crime   Emmett Till   murder   racism   USA   Wright Thompson",

The smoke drifted thousands of miles to the eastern seaboard and turned the skies hazy, the Sun orange, and the air dangerous for some people to breathe. But there’s good news: your Covid mask works for air pollution too!\nDr. Commane said people should avoid going outdoors in high-pollution conditions, and especially avoid strenuous exercise. She also suggested that wearing filtered masks can provide protection for those who can’t avoid the outdoors.\n“A lot of the masks people have been wearing for Covid are designed to capture PM2.5,” she said, referring to N95-style masks. “That’s the right size to be very useful for air quality.”\n\n\nIt’s always nice when your apocalyptic dystopias match up so nicely.\nTags: Covid-19   global warming",

          "description": "Sarah Miller, author of this 2019 article on Miami real estate & rising oceans, recently wrote this resonant piece, All The Right Words On Climate Have Already Been Said.\nI told her I didn’t have anything to say about climate change anymore, other than that I was not doing well, that I was miserable. “I am so unhappy right now.” I said those words. So unhappy. Fire season was not only already here, I said, but it was going to go on for at least four more months, and I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself. I didn’t know how I would stand the anxiety. I told her I felt like all I did every day was try to act normal while watching the world end, watching the lake recede from the shore, and the river film over, under the sun, an enormous and steady weight.\nThere’s only one thing I have to say about climate change, I said, and that’s that I want it to rain, a lot, but it’s not going to rain a lot, and since that’s the only thing I have to say and it’s not going to happen, I don’t have anything to say.\n\n\nMiller continued:\nAlso, for what? Let’s give the article (the one she was starting to maybe think about asking me to write that I was wondering if I could write) the absolute biggest benefit of the doubt and imagine that people read it and said, “Wow, this is exactly how I feel, thanks for putting it into words.”\nWhat then? What would happen then? Would people be “more aware” about climate change? It’s 109 degrees in Portland right now. It’s been over 130 degrees in Baghdad several times. What kind of awareness quotient are we looking for? What more about climate change does anyone need to know? What else is there to say?\n\n\nThis is where I am on the climate emergency most days now (and nearly there on the pandemic). Really, what the fuck else is there to say?\nTags: global warming   journalism   Sarah Miller",

I have to really understand what I’m doing and then I think through almost every possibility and eventuality, like a mind map on steroids. And I plan. When people say things like: “Who could have imagined XYZ would happen?” about some entirely predictable outcome, my most common response is “I could”. I have realised that for most people I am an overthinker, but for me, it is others who underthink. I just think.\n\n\nI have taken my foot off the overthinking pedal in recent years, but that paragraph more or less describes me to a T. My anxiety and overthinking used to feel like a handicap, like something to be overcome, but Oliver Burkeman’s persuasive argument in The Antidote convinced me to think about my anxiety as useful and even a little bit of a superpower, as long as it doesn’t spiral out of control.\nTags: Annalisa Barbieri",

          "description": "This piece by Susan Matthews is really helpful for those of us who are vaccinated and trying to figure out what their risks are regarding the much more transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is endemic now — how do we live with that? What reasonable actions should we take to keep ourselves, our communities, and our loved ones safe?\nAll of this is making people — yes, probably mostly vaccinated people — rethink the basic questions they thought their vaccine had answered for them: Can I go to restaurants and bars unmasked? Can I go back to the office? Can I see my grandma? Can I go on vacation? Can I unmask at my people-facing job? Can I have a wedding, or a party? The answer to those questions is not quite as easy as “yes, if you’re vaccinated.” It depends partly on how many in your group are vaccinated, but the actual answer is basically the same as it’s been all pandemic: It depends on your risk tolerance, it depends on what is happening with case counts locally (though, as more people travel, this might become a less reliable tool), and it depends on any unique risk factors in your group. Kass’ perspective felt novel to me: She said she suspects that in the end, a lot of people are going to end up boosting their immunity by suffering through a mild case of COVID. So no one should feel that bad about getting sick after they’re vaxxed. What matters is getting the order right: “If everyone who gets vaccinated still gets COVID but doesn’t die, that’s a success,” she said. The issue is that it doesn’t feel like a success for vaccinated people. Plus, “if you get infected after you’re vaxxed, it’s all you talk about,” she said. And right now, that’s understandably freaking out a lot of vaccinated people who thought they were in the clear.\n\n\nLong Covid isn’t mentioned anywhere in here though — surely that has to be part of the conversation here (although anecdotally it doesn’t seem like too much of a worry).\nTags: Covid-19   medicine   science   Susan Matthews",

In a recent Facebook post, Cobia shares that people are willing to get vaccinated after having to watch an unvaccinated member of their family die from Covid.\nI’ve made a LOT of progress encouraging people to get vaccinated lately!!! Do you want to know how? I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious COVID infections. One of the last things they do before they’re intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell them that I’m sorry, but it’s too late. A few days later when I call time of death, I hug their family members and I tell them the best way to honor their loved one is to go get vaccinated and encourage everyone they know to do the same. They cry. And they tell me they didn’t know. They thought it was a hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn’t get as sick. They thought it was ‘just the flu’. But they were wrong. And they wish they could go back. But they can’t. So they thank me and they go get the vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a small prayer that this loss will save more lives.\n\n\nHeartbreaking.\nTags: Brytney Cobia   Covid-19   medicine   vaccines",

It anchored the flight into the heavens, tethering it to the persistence of racial inequality, and pulling it out of the abstract, universal realm in which we like to place our technical achievements. Though I still think the hunger for the technological sublime crosses racial boundaries, it destabilized the ease with which people could use “our” in that kind of sentence.

After docking, Eagle was jettisoned and the three astronauts returned to Earth in Columbia. It was presumed that Eagle orbited the Moon until eventually crashing into the surface, but a recent analysis shows that the spacecraft may have entered a stable orbit and is still circling the Moon decades after the end of the mission, a priceless artifact of an historic achievement.\nMost spacecraft in lunar orbit suffer from instability in their orbits due to the ‘lumpy’ nature of the lunar gravity which tends to cause the orbits to eventually get so elliptical that they hit the moon.\nHowever, an amateur space fan wanted to narrow down the possible impact location and used orbit modelling software to propagate the orbit forwards in time until it hit the moon. He was surprised to find that it didn’t hit the moon, and remained in a stable orbit for decades, this suggests that the Eagle may still be orbiting the moon over 5 decades after being left there.\n\n\nThe paper detailing the analysis suggests that if Eagle has survived, it should be detectable by radar.\nTags: Apollo   Apollo 11   astronomy   space",

          "description": "Michael Buckley:\nmacOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.\nThis is the primary reason Retrobatch isn't sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I've considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can't bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.\nEvery year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.\nSee also this really old radar: rdar://13006144: Sandbox and limitation on number of files that can be opened from a user.",

          "description": "Photo by Carlee Calfee/NHLI via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nA bit of housekeeping is complete. \n We’re deep into August and things are pretty quiet on the hockey news front, at least for the Flyers, but they still have a few loose ends that needed (or might need) tying up, and they knocked out one of those today. \nThe Flyers announced this afternoon that they’ve signed their 2021 second round pick Samu Tuomaala to a three-year entry level contract. Tuomaala spent the 2020-21 season with Kärpät’s U20 team, where he put up 31 points (15 goals and 16 assists) in 30 regular season games, and four points (1G, 4A) in five playoff games. He also represented Finland in the U18 World Championship, and he recorded 11 points (5G, 6A) in seven games, leading his team in scoring. \nIn short: he’s good, gang! Here’s what Flyers’ AGM Brent Flahr and Director of European Scouting Joakim Grundberg had to say about him. \n“He’s a guy we targeted. We kind of thought he would probably go at the end of the first or somewhere in the 20s and he fell. A real talented winger. Great skater. Real dynamic speed. Loves to shoot the puck. Talented kid. He’s going to take a little time to get stronger and put on a little weight. A talented kid that has real good offensive upside.” - Flahr\n“Obviously very excited getting him. He was rated as a first round talent. We were able to get him in the middle of the second round, so we’re really excited about that. To us, he has elite speed and high skill. Very good shot. High-offensive upside. There’s things he’s got to work on like his overall game and obviously getting stronger. We’re really excited. We see a lot of upside there.” - Grundberg\nNow, it may still be a little while before we see Tuomaala make the jump over to North America. He’s slated to join Kärpät (Liiga) next season, and this ELC can slide to allow that to happen. But he’s locked in with the Flyers all the same, and it’s a bit of housekeeping taken care of.",

At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.\nHe was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. \nSeeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.",

          "description": "Photo by Len Redkoles/NHLI via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nChuck Fletcher adds another depth piece.\n Continuing a very busy, yet simultaneously quiet free agency for the Flyers, the Orange & Black have signed former New York Ranger Adam Clendening to a one year, two-way deal, and if the other two-way deals signed today are any indication, his NHL salary will be something in the $700-$750k range. With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.\nClendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. \nPhiladelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.",

The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange & Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.\nThompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.\nWith this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.",

          "description": "Photo by Rocky W. Widner/NHL/Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nWell, there’s your backup goalie.\n After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.\nJones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.\nSince the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.\nThis article may be updated.",

He didn’t pick up any points in that span, but getting that opportunity in the first place is no small accomplishment. And between that and McLaughlin’s scoring numbers at the high school level, there’s a whole lot that’s interesting about his profile. And coming in the seventh round, it’s a really nice low risk pick with the potential for a high reward. \nWe also cannot resist mentioning that he’s pretty close to a Philly local, hailing from Spring City, PA. \nPer Flyers AGM Brent Flahr, McLaughlin will be going to Sioux City of the USHL next season, but once he moves on to the NCAA level, he’s committed to play at Penn State, and should be a nice addition to their program there.",

While the Flyers’ first two pickups of the day on defense brought a bit more of a dynamic offensive game, Samson falls more into the mold of a defensive-defenseman. He was able to get a bit of power play time this season on top of his even strength and penalty kill responsibilities, and was still able to bring a bit of scoring to the table, with 12 points in his 22 games played. So there is a bit of offensive upside there, but it’s really Samson’s defensive game that stands out. \nHe has a good motor and brings a nice bit of physicality. He anticipates plays well and brings a good defensive awareness, and we see that working well both in the defensive zone and at the blue line, as he works on breaking up entries. But he also still skates and passes well, so there is still a good bit of dynamic skill to his game, it’s not as though he’s just a one trick defensive pony, if you will. \nAnd the pipeline fills out further at defense!",

Murchison put up modest scoring numbers in his draft year, with three goals and two assists in 23 games played (USHL) and seven goals and eight assists in 48 games played (USDP). He brings good size (6’2”, 192 pounds), but could still stand to get a little stronger. And while there’s still some polishing that needs to go into his game, all told, there’s a lot to like. He’s a smooth skater, and strong passer, and can transition the puck well. He brings a quick shot that he can get through traffic well, and that’s made him particularly effective on the power play. His defensive game needs some polishing, but his instincts are generally good, and he’s able to make use of good stick work to break up plays. The fundamentals are good. \nAnd we have two fun facts!\nTy Murchison, just picked up by the Flyers is a converted inline player. Headed to Arizona State next season.

Kolosov brings very good quickness, and also generally good positioning on top of that. He’s economic in his movements, angles well, and flexes quite solid rebound control. There’s a definite calmness to his play, both in his ability to maintain control of his movements when he does have to move quickly, but also in how he rarely seems to get rattled when the game may not be going his way. \nCertainly there’s still a good bit of work that needs to be done to clean up and develop his game, but the Flyers seem willing to give him the time to develop, and are hoping to add a nice bit of organizational depth and further bolster their goaltender prospect pipeline.",

The Flyers lose a bit of the scoring game that they had with Voracek, but they gain a stronger play driver. Atkinson and Voracek are the same age, and while Atkinson is signed for four more years (one more than Voracek), his cap hit is just $5.875 million, so the Flyers do free up $2.375 million in cap space. \nAnd, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t also mention in the locker room implications of this move. There has been talk for a while about the mix with this Flyers team, in the locker room, not being right somehow, and the core being in need of a shake-up. And, well, moving out one of the team’s longest tenured players certainly achieves just that. \nWhat’s more, Atkinson was part of the leadership group in Columbus, and while it may not be fair to assume that he’ll immediately step into a similar role in Philadelphia, he remains a new voice with that leadership experience, and that hardly seems like a bad thing. \nIt’s been a busy offseason, to be sure, and next season’s new look Flyers are continuing to evolve.",

With just one year remaining on his contract that gives him a cap hit of $5.4-million, this is certainly swinging big and gambling on a decent improvement if he isn’t subject to the league’s best forwards coming at him. Who knows if that will even happen.\nWith Ristolainen’s contracts on their books, the Flyers now sit around $8.4 million to re-sign Carter Hart, Travis Sanheim and fill out the depths of their roster.\nMore to come.",

It’s been clear for a while now that the Flyers and Gostisbehere were no longer a good match, and giving the Coyotes a second-round pick allowed the Flyers to move Gostisbehere without retaining any salary.\nNow more than ever cap space comes at a premium, and the Flyers had to give up a significant asset in order to get out of Gostisbehere’s contract. Paying a team with draft picks to take Ghost wasn’t how anybody thought his time here in Philly would end back when he was tearing up the league in his rookie season, but a combination of injuries, poor performance, and poor usage led us here. \nArizona will be hoping Gostisbehere can find his game in the desert, and for Gostisbehere’s sake, the move hopefully leads to an uptick in power-play minutes as well less time watching AHL defensemen from the press box.",
