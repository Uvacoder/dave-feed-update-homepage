          "description": "Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the ‌AirPods‌ 3 on September 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple's third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods, iPhone 13\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forums: AirPods, iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 to Launch on September 17, AirPods 3 on September 30, Claims Report\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFitbit Charge 5\n179 USDhttps://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x\n— Snoopy (@_snoopytech_) August 22, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nEvery device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there's no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that's expected to be announced in the next month or so.\nTag: Fitbit\nThis article, \"Fitbit Charge 5 Tracker Design and Features Leaked in New Video\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. \"Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980,\" read Jobs' note.\nJulian recalls, \"I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests.

He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care.\"\nRR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also auctioned off other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices.

According to Bloomberg, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple's store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then reinstated mask mandates at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple had also planned to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since pushed back those plans because of the prevalence of the delta variant.\nTag: Apple Store\nThis article, \"Apple Closes South Carolina Store After COVID-19 Exposure, Other Stores Cutting Hours Due to Staff Shortages\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Images of an aluminum cutout allegedly based on the upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini have surfaced online. The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn't very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It's also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros. \nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: DuanRui\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Aluminum Cutout Allegedly Based on iPad Mini 6 Showcases Thinner Bezels, Larger Camera, Touch ID in Power Button\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The baseline update sits at the lower end of the ‌iPad‌ lineup and is tailored for customers needing an affordable ‌iPad‌ for day-to-day use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the 9th generation model, Apple is likely to continue with the current design featuring Touch ID and a Home Button. The updated model will feature a faster processor with improved performance and graphics and a thinner form factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe updated ‌iPad‌ joins a busy fall season for Apple, as the company is also expected to be preparing a more significant update to the iPad mini. The new iPad mini is rumored to feature a larger display with smaller bezels, improved performance, and an updated overall design.

          "description": "Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple's $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple's cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple's upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that's \"roughly the same\" as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.\nTags: Google, Google Pixel\nThis article, \"Google Announces Low-Cost 5G Pixel 5a Smartphone, Plans to Nix Chargers in Box Going Forward\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The ‌iCloud‌ for Windows app is designed to let Windows users access their ‌iCloud‌ files, photos, emails, and more from Windows devices.\nTag: iCloud for Windows\nThis article, \"Apple Releases iCloud 12.5 for Windows With iCloud Keychain Password Manager App\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Mobile gaming enthusiasts may remember that the game had soft launched on the App Store in Canada back in 2019, but it was removed less than a year later. No specific release date has been announced for its Apple Arcade return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe side-scrolling action game will feature a lineup of iconic characters from the popular gothic video game series, including Alucard, Simon Belmont, Charlotte, Shanoa, Maria, and more to come. Players will be tasked with blasting their way through Dracula's army using a variety of attacks, weapons, and unique character moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original trailer for the game from 2019 can be watched below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, a trio of Apple Arcade games have recently been updated, with a new mini-game and new quests added to The Oregon Trail, five new songs added to Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat, and 200 new levels added in Simon's Cat - Story Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

The Eve Spectrum is now shipping out and available, so we thought we'd test it out to see if it's worth picking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\n\r\n\r\nThere are three versions of the 27-inch Spectrum display. For $459, you can get a Spectrum QHD with a 144Hz refresh rate, while a 240Hz version is available for $609. A 4K version is also available with a 144Hz refresh rate, and this top-of-the-line version costs $799. The Spectrum stand for those who aren't using a VESA mount is an additional $99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors videographer Dan Barbera has been testing the 4K 144Hz version, and he found the design to be minimal, clean, and subtle, and for video editing work, it performed well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColors were accurate and natural and viewing angles were solid, but there is some light bleed with blacks and contrast doesn't quite measure up to some other displays at this price point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay was smooth thanks to the high refresh rate, and the high contrast and peak brightness made games look great. There were times, however, that the video feed would die, and it's unclear if the issue was a cable or a port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eve Spectrum comes equipped with a single DisplayPort port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, along with an audio port. There's no Thunderbolt support, but with a 100W USB-C port, it can charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few gaming monitors with these specs and HDMI 2.1, so for those who need these features, the Spectrum may be worth checking out.

All of these features have been rumored previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for pricing, TrendForce believes the iPhone 13 series will be priced similarly as the iPhone 12 series, assuming that Apple is able to effectively control manufacturing costs, due to the lack of many significant hardware upgrades. While the iPhone 12 series was announced in October last year, likely due to pandemic-related delays, the research firm said Apple will return to a September release for the iPhone 13 series this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrendForce said iPhone shipments will likely maintain a growth trajectory in the third quarter of 2021 following the launch of the iPhone 13 series.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: TrendForce\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Models Said to Launch in September With Larger Batteries, mmWave 5G in Additional Countries, and More\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.\nAt first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the Apple Car. One report vaguely referenced Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌Apple Car‌'s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers.

The lenses were \"pre-assembled.\" Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.\r\n\r\nUp to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film that are pre-assembled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.\nFoxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System.

The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Things Cloud \"Fractus\" is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Things Cloud \"Fractus\", however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings 3.14 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $49.99 and from the iOS App Store. The iPad version is priced at $19.99 [Direct Link] while the iPhone version (which includes Apple Watch support) is priced at $9.99.

This means that even if a user connects someone else's ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner's ‌Apple ID‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device's location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods Pro, AirPods Max\nTag: Find My\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods Pro (Neutral), AirPods Max (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"AirPods Find My Network Support Includes Tethering to Apple ID and New Manual Unpairing Process\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefurbished iPads are covered by Apple's standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week.

          "description": "The 2022 iPhones and Macs may feature chips built on the 3nm process, as Apple's leading chip supplier, TSMC, is planning to begin mass production for 3nm chips destined for Apple in the second half of next year, according to a preview of an upcoming report by DigiTimes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paywalled preview of the full report, which will be published tomorrow, reads: \r\n\r\nTSMC is on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022 for Apple's devices, either iPhones or Mac computers, according to industry sources.\nEarlier in June, TSMC was reportedly beefing up capacity to begin production of 3nm chips, but DigiTimes at the time refrained from mentioning Apple as a potential initial beneficiary of the new process. Today's preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has already reportedly booked TSMC's entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year's iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple's plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We'll be sure to let MacRumors' readers know if the new report shares anything of significance. \nTags: digitimes.com, 2022 iPhones\nThis article, \"2022 iPhones and Macs May Feature 3nm Chips\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple plans to launch a new MacBook Air with a mini-LED display and several color options around mid 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors. These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser\n\r\n\r\nKuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an \"all-new design\" with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nTags: Ming-Chi Kuo, TF International Securities\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Caution)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Kuo: Redesigned MacBook Air With Mini-LED Display and Several Color Options to Launch in Mid 2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The judge decided that PMC's patent for digital rights management is unenforceable because the company delayed its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to get more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC filed hundreds patent applications in the 1980s and 1990s, but no patents were awarded until 2010. The company took advantage of a loophole that allowed for an indefinite application process and then a patent valid for 17 years. This was addressed in 1995, but didn't apply to the patents used against Apple because they were filed earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC delayed receiving its patents until after the technology in the patent had already been adopted, letting it make more money from tech companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal documentation from PMC suggested the company had thought that Apple would be a \"natural candidate\" to target with delayed patents, along with Intel, IBM, and Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMC won a $308.5 million verdict against Apple in March after a jury said that Apple infringed on DRM patents with its FairPlay technology that is used to distribute encrypted content through iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Won't Have to Pay $309M After Judge Accuses Patent Troll of Abusing System to Fleece Tech Companies\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, which is estimated to manufacture around 80 percent of the world's iPhones, has raised its new hires bonus to a record high of 10,200 yuan (U.S. $1,578).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, Lens Technology has doubled its bonus 5,000 yuan in February to 10,000 yuan in May, while Luxshare Precision's factory in Guangdong has doubled its internal referral bonus from 2,500 yuan in April to 5,000 yuan in May, with a top-up bonus of 3,800 yuan for returning workers who previously left the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past three years, Apple has added more new suppliers from mainland China to its vendor list than any other country, but simultaneously the growth of China's labor force has peaked as factory jobs have started to lose their appeal and more workers move out of industrial labor, leading to companies having to lure in workers with more attractive pay packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current aggressive hiring spree seeks to combat increasingly ramped-up production for the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTags: Foxconn, scmp.com, Luxshare\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Suppliers Struggling to Hire Enough Workers Ahead of iPhone 13 Launch\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Last year, Cook was paid compensation of $133.7 million, but ranked second after Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was paid $595.3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook has overseen Apple's rise to become the most profitable company in the world this year with revenue of $274.515 billion and profit of $57.411 billion, according to the Fortune Global 500 rankings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Cook was surpassed in terms of pay by the COO of Oak Street Health, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, the CEO of Opendoor Technologies, and the Co-CEOs of GoodRX Holdings. Elon Musk again overwhelmingly topped the list with compensation amounting to $6.658 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast month, it was alleged that Musk demanded to become the CEO of Apple as part of early discussions around a potential Apple acquisition of Tesla, though Musk denies this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's Senior Vice President of Retail and People Deirdre O'Brien and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams also made the list in 93rd and 96th place, with pay of $45 million each.

Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, \"designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data,\" according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by The Intercept revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys.

With this feature, Google Maps users can share their real-time location with friends in an iMessage using the Google Maps button in the Messages app. Location is shared for one hour by default, but there is an option to extend access by up to three days or stop access at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle's blog post also highlights the recently introduced widgets feature, which allows ‌iPhone‌ users to add a Google Maps widget to the Home Screen or the Today View.

Apple reportedly met with Omni MedSci between 2014 to 2016 to discuss a possible partnership, but Apple is said to have ended discussions and used technology from four Omni patents anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, Apple attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci is owned by Mohammed Islam, who has been described as a \"poster child for a patenting professional.\" He owns six companies and has collected more than 150 patents. In the past, he has used those patents to sue companies that include Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia, and Siemens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam is employed by the University of Michigan, and Apple's argument for dismissal was that his patents were owned by the university, which the University of Michigan supported on behalf of Apple. The appeals court decided that was not the case, and that Islam's employment agreement did not automatically assign his patents to the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmni MedSci has claimed that Apple willfully infringed on its patents. The company is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of the Apple Watch, along with damages. Omni MedSci's attorney told Reuters that the company is \"pleased by not surprised\" by the ruling.\nTag: Patent lawsuits\nThis article, \"Apple Can't Escape Apple Watch Heart Rate Sensor Patent Lawsuit, Court Rules\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The iPhone 13 is widely expected to come with Wi-Fi 6E capabilities, and while it may seem rather nuanced to the average consumer, with only improved speeds and being \"up to date\" in the realm of Wi-Fi technology, it's actually a fairly significant improvement, laying the groundwork for much of what we know the future holds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo truly understand Wi-Fi 6E, MacRumors sat down for an exclusive interview with Kevin Robinson, senior vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, to discuss the new generation of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi's relationship with 5G, and what new experiences it will enable. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a group few have probably heard of, but as Kevin describes it, it's a crucial part of the Wi-Fi puzzle, consisting of a \"who's who\" in the connectivity space.\nAll of these c…",

          "description": "Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the \"Apple Watch Edition\" collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple's retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn't stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.\r\n\r\nApple hasn't said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here's my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn't sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn't surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what's the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? \nAs Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of \"Apple Watch Edition\" models with ceramic and gold. Apple may also decide to end the titanium Apple Watch models later this fall.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nTag: bloomberg.com\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Titanium Apple Watch Series 6 Models Currently Widely Unavailable\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely.

Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They're IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for iPhone licenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang & Olufsen's website and in Bang & Olufsen retail stores. \nTag: Bang & Olufsen\nThis article, \"Bang & Olufsen Announces First Noise-Canceling True Wireless Earbuds\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple informed employees about the change in a memo:\n\"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated.\" The company added it is making the change \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nIn addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. \"Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it,\" reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Stores\nTags: Apple retail, COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice\nThis article, \"Many U.S. Apple Retail Stores Again Require Customers to Wear Masks\" first appeared on MacRumors.com",

Starting on November 1, Nintendo says an end-of-service notification will be displayed and the game will not be playable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nPlayers will be able to look back at their player history in \"Dr. Mario World Memories,\" a web page that Nintendo plans to launch later this year. This website will use player history, and customers can avoid being included by deleting their save data in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Mario World is a puzzle game based on the well-known Dr. Mario Nintendo title. Players are tasked with matching capsules with viruses in order to clear out all the viruses on the board, and Nintendo characters like Peach, Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba appear in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Nintendo's other titles, Dr. Mario World is a free-to-play game that included optional in-app purchases, but apparently the game failed to catch on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBloomberg last year said that Nintendo is \"retreating\" from its mobile game plans, focusing on already-released titles rather than debuting new games. Nintendo has had success with games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, but has not been able to maintain sales momentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNintendo previously discontinued Miitomo, Pokémon Duel, and Pokémon Rumble Rush.

          "description": "Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the \"A18\" or the \"M5.\" While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple's sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC's manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple's first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.\nTags: TSMC, nikkei.com\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier TSMC Readies 2nm Chips for 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

I would classify it as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.\nCook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: earnings\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Expecting iPhone and iPad Supply Constraints in September Quarter\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The popular racing game features more than 240 real cars to select from automakers and brands such as Ferrari, Ducati, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti, Mercedes, Audi, Ford, and Chevrolet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Baldo\" is described as an action-adventure roleplaying game with puzzles, exploration, and combat, all set in a hand-drawn open world. Players will embark on a journey into a magical land full of mysteries to discover as they complete the main story quest and many side quests. The game will be available on Apple Arcade starting Friday, August 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother racing game \"Detonation Racing\" launches on Apple Arcade this Friday, with players having to navigate an environment rigged to blow up, collapse, and burst into flames at the least convenient moments. The game hails from Electric Square, the creators of another popular racing game \"Forza Street\" and the \"Hot Wheels id\" racing system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.\nTag: Apple Arcade\nThis article, \"Two New Games Coming to Apple Arcade, Including Gameloft's Racing Classic 'Asphalt 8: Airborne'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Researchers are rethinking plans to use the Apple Watch in studies after finding inconsistencies in the data gathered by the device (via The Verge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in the Apple Watch's heart rate variability data are reportedly caused by Apple tweaking the device's algorithms, meaning that data from the same time period can change without warning. Associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the Beiwe data platform, J.P. Onnela, told The Verge:\nThese algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they're not transparent. So it's impossible to know what's in them.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital exported the heart rate data from Apple Watches for the same period of time, but several months apart. The data should have been identical, but since it is filtered through an algorithm prior to export it was drastically different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple changes its algorithms regularly and without warning, so exporting the same data at different times may use different algorithms. Beyond heart rate variability, researchers looking into sleep tracking have experienced similar problems with changes to algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mostly precludes commercial devices from being used by researchers, resulting in the need for devices specifically designed to collect data for scientific studies. While this is adequate for some studies, it heavily constrains research into the medical value of commercially available products for users. Some researchers say that Apple should publicize the changes it makes to algorithms or make the Apple Watch's raw data available.\nRelated Roundups: Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch SE\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution), Apple Watch SE (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Researchers Struggle to Use Apple Watch in Studies Due to Sudden Algorithm Changes\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Get vaccinated or stay home.\nThe vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty, the FDA said in its announcement on Monday.\nI don’t care what they call it, but that’s a bad name. Looks like someone spilled a drink on the keyboard while trying to type “Cormac McCarthy”.\n(Moderna has secured “Spikevax” for their vaccine, an excellent name.)\n ★",

I saw the tradeoffs firsthand around\nhaving to design for engagement versus people using the product.\nThat experience made me want to build something different. […]\nWe intentionally didn’t raise venture capital. We didn’t want to\nmake the compromises that I saw earlier in my career. With no\noutside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo\nadvertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several\nother things we feel would compromise the product and community\nwe’re trying to build.\nOm: Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional\nphotographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?\nTW: It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be\nanything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone\nwith tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe\ngreat photography can come from anywhere and anyone.

Right around the 3:00 mark:\n“And if, and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order\nof 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does\nApple know anything about your account and know anything about\nthose images.”\nThere’s also a WSJ news story (News+ link), co-bylined by Stern and Tim Higgins, in which Federighi emphasizes that the database of CSAM fingerprints is auditable:\nBeyond creating a system that isn’t scanning through all of a\nuser’s photos in the cloud, Mr. Federighi pointed to another\nbenefit of placing the matching process on the phone directly.\n“Because it’s on the [phone], security researchers are constantly\nable to introspect what’s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,”\nhe said. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the\nscope of this in some way — in a way that we had committed to not\ndoing — there’s verifiability, they can spot that that’s\nhappening.”\nCritics have said the database of images could be corrupted, such\nas political material being inserted. Apple has pushed back\nagainst that idea. During the interview, Mr. Federighi said the\ndatabase of images is constructed through the intersection of\nimages from multiple child-safety organizations — not just the\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He added that\nat least two “are in distinct jurisdictions.” Such groups and an\nindependent auditor will be able to verify that the database\nconsists only of images provided by those entities, he said.\n ★",

For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.\nFor everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:\nYou know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled\ndocuments open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some\nnotes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s\namazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose\nyour carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,\nbut we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and\neasier: Notes.\nNotes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you\ndon’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you\ndon’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.\nNotes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format\ninvolved. […]\nThere are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits\nyour workflow and style.\nNotes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).\nSee also:\nJason Snell, who wrote a nifty AppleScript that lets him drag an image into a Markdown file in BBEdit 14, and have it (a) upload that file to his server in the background, and (b) insert the Markdown syntax to reference that just-uploaded file.\n\n\nWatts Martin, who has a good overview of where BBEdit 14 stands compared to several popular competing programming text editors.\n\n\n\n\n ★",

It will help limit the risk of transmission at destinations where unvaccinated people travel—and, by setting norms that restrict certain privileges to vaccinated people, will also help raise the stagnant vaccination rates that are keeping both the economy and society from fully recovering.\nFlying is not a right, and the case for restricting it to vaccinated people is straightforward: The federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety. And although air-filtration systems and mask requirements make transmission of the coronavirus unlikely during any given passenger flight, infected people can spread it when they leave the airport and take off their mask.\n ★",

And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.\nLess mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.\nGoogle is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone.\n“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google really means it this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.\n ★",

I don’t understand\nhow we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.\nHere’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:\nA year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an\nobviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of\n2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread\nof Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term\nsolution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the\nworld could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.\nNow those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of\nsummer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a\nmask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and\nfederal governments — should consider mandating something else\nfirst: vaccination.\nAsking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. The backlash is growing.\n ★",

If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.\n ★",

That’s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar.

But there’s an awful lot of non-sharing stuff crammed into the Share menu — the ᴀA menu items from the current version of Safari (text size, Reader mode, disabling content blockers temporarily, etc.) are all in “Share” now. It’s better than the “···” menu in betas 1–3, but really, this is more like changing the “···” glyph to the Share glyph. It’s still two menus’ worth of features stuffed into one monolithic menu.\n\n\nThe Reload button is back. But it’s bizarrely tiny — way smaller than the minimum recommended tap target size of 44 x 44 points. And it shares space with the newly restored Reader mode button. When you load a page, if Reader mode is available, the Reader mode button shows briefly (maybe for 1–2 seconds?) along with the text “Reader Available” under the website’s domain name. But then the “Reader Available” label fades out and the Reader mode button turns into the Reload button. To enable Reader mode at this point, you either need to long-press the URL domain name to bring up a shortcut menu, or tap the — you guessed it — Share button, which has its own “Reader” item near the top.\n\n\nBookmarks are supposed to be easier to access, but I think most users accustomed to previous versions of Mobile Safari — which heretofore has always had a bookmarks button right in the main toolbar — are going to struggle to find them.\n\n\n\nApple is clearly trying to address the numerous complaints about the Safari 15 design for iPhone, but beta 4 feels like they’ve decided that the solution to finding themselves in a hole is to dig faster.\n ★",

The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.\nThe Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.\nThe Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.\nThe studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.\nThe Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.",

It’s Doom, but you’re a wizard casting spells and firing off magical bolts instead of firing a gun. \nIn Into the Pit, you play a member of a family of mystics. Your cousin has gone missing, and it probably has something to do with the demonic pit she uncovered in her search for occult power. From there, the player has to run through a roguelite dungeon, mixing and matching runes and spells to become better at killing demons.\nInto the Pit is set to release on PC and Xbox One on Oct. 19, which makes it a perfect pre-Halloween experience for those who enjoy old school FPS gameplay. The game will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.",

On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.\nStaten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.\n“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”\nCo-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning.

Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.\nIt’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands. The Elder Scrolls 6 remains elusive, but fans will be able to tuck into Skyrim once again and enjoy all of their old quests — as well as a new spin, thanks to fishing.",

But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.\nDuring a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.\n“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”\nCall of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division; Captain Wade Jackson, from the U.S.’s Scouting Squadron Six; and Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs of Australia’s 20th Battalion. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s preview.\nAt the same time that Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.\nTreyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. \nTreyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map.

The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.\nIn addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.\nSenior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with.

          "description": "Photo: Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nHorror game’s next chapter may summon Pinhead\n Horror game Dead by Daylight’s next chapter will apparently bring the Hellraiser film franchise into the fold, based on a series of teases from developer Behaviour Interactive. That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.\nBehaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.\nThat’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.\nBehaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.\nDead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.",

          "description": "Image: CD Projekt Red/CD Projekt\n    \n\n  \nPatch 1.3 is expected soon\n Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is expected to launch soon. On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.\nFirst, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. \n\n\nSecond, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.\n\n\nFinally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.\n“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”\nMonday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way. CD Projekt promises more details on Aug. 17 during a live Twitch stream.\nCyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.",

This year’s entry in the franchise, which is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games, will be called Call of Duty: Vanguard and send players back to World War II, according to images of the game that leaked earlier this week.\nThe victory scene is new for season 5 of Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which went live on Friday. The cutscene shows the winning team being extracted from the battlefield — that is until, a red-haired woman in a Soviet World War II uniform shoots the last player with an old-school wooden sniper rifle. The soldier’s attire and weapon seem to support the aforementioned leaks, which suggested that 2021’s Call of Duty game will take place in WWII. \nWhat’s more is that the character herself resembles a person depicted in leaked images of Vanguard — further seeming to confirm prior information, and that the victory scene is a reference to the upcoming game. \nThe leaks also contained details on Vanguard’s Ultimate Edition and information about three bundles for the game.

Wavelengths is a DLC addition to True Colors, and it doesn’t seem to touch at all on the main mystery of Gabe Chen.

Wavelengths gives us a little more background on who Steph is, and that may influence the choices players make throughout the story of True Colors.\nThe soundtrack includes songs from Girl in Red, Alt-J, Portugal, The Man, Foals, Hayley Kiyoko, and Maribou State. As Steph becomes more comfortable as a DJ, the player gets to see other aspects of her life. This includes running a D&D game with a friend, using the D20 to give callers advice on the radio, and swiping left or right on profiles during Pride month. \nThe entire DLC looks incredibly cozy, and it’ll be interesting to see how it adds to the main story.

Now that the Sentinels of Light have put down the Ruined King and saved the world, things should be pretty peaceful, right? Well, the event left a lot of loose threads hanging, like the fate of characters like Karma, Shyvana, or Thresh. On Thursday, Riot released a new cinematic that answers at least a few of those questions.\nThe cinematic stars Thresh, who is a spectral warden from the Shadow Isles. In the Sentinels of Light event, he gathered up all of the power from Viego’s scary invasion and used it to craft himself a different form. With this new, mostly human form, Thresh is free to wander the world. This cinematic is an immediate follow-up that shows us what he’s doing with his freedom, and it’s nothing good! He’s back to shackling and torturing souls inside his scary lantern, but at least he’s appointing middle management to help out. In this case, that’s an unfortunate tavern keep called Bort with a crab claw for an arm.\nThis cinematic also shows Thresh in a different light than his in-game splash art. Instead of having his sick abs out for everyone to admire, he appears much more sinister and skeletal in this one. Even when he’s just in the tavern, pretending to be a normal guy, you can tell there’s something off there. It’s a great rendition of the character, and it’ll be intriguing to see where his story leads.",

          "description": "Image: Rockstar Games\n    \n\n  \nAnother chance to meet Clyde, Tommy, and CJ\n Rockstar Games may be releasing remasters of three classic Grand Theft Auto Games, according to a report from Kotaku. This remains unconfirmed, but the remastered version of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are rumored to arrive on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and mobile devices.\nKotaku’s report suggests that the games will be “a mix of new and old graphics,” akin to a “heavily-modded version of a classic GTA title.” The UI of the games will be updated for clarity as well, though it’ll remain the classic visual style. Gameplay is expected to remain as close as possible to the original iterations.\nThese three titles are part of the “3D universe” of Rockstar Games, which include the PS2 era of Grand Theft Auto before the series moved into high definition with Grand Theft Auto 4. While these games aren’t quite as fleshed out or involved as Rockstar’s modern titles, they still remain classics. Lines from San Andreas, like CJ’s iconic “Ah, shit, here we go again,” remain a popular part of the zeitgeist.\nKotaku says Rockstar Dundee, a Scottish studio, is heading up development on these remastered titles. It’s unclear when they might be released, especially due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it seems as though it will likely be in one bundle.\nRockstar also reportedly has plans for a Red Dead Redemption remaster.\nWe’ve reached out to Rockstar for comment, and will update this story should it respond with additional information.",

Williams returns as ‘Irish’ from Battlefield 4\n Battlefield 2042 won’t feature a traditional narrative single-player campaign, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carry over storytelling elements from previous games — or that it won’t tell stories of its own. In a newly released short film titled “Exodus,” developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts set up the story of Battlefield 2042 and confirm the return of a beloved character: Battlefield 4’s Kimble “Irish” Graves, once again played by Michael K. Williams.\nThe nine-minute film appears to confirm a canonical ending for 2013’s Battlefield 4: that Irish, not Huang “Hannah” Shuyi, survives the events of that game’s campaign. As such, Irish will be a playable “No-Pat” Specialist in Battlefield 2042. \n“Exodus” also introduces a new character to Battlefield lore named Oz. He clashes with Irish over the future of the No-Pats — 2042’s nickname for the non-patriated soldiers who fight in the upcoming game’s global conflict. EA said in a news released that the story of Battlefield 2042 will “continue to evolve over time” and will be told through future playable specialists — not unlike how EA’s Apex Legends or Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch handle their storytelling.\nIrish is the fifth confirmed specialist coming in Battlefield 2042, following Casper, Mackay, Boris, and Falck, who were revealed in June. Battlefield 2042 is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.",

On Wednesday, Riot Games released an animated trailer revealing the next set of champions and locations from League of Legends to come to the franchise’s card game. Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards. This includes 9 new champions, including some from outside Bandle City like the Piltover sheriff Caitlyn.\nThe new expansion will also have new keywords that reflect the whimsical nature of the Yordles. In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.\nIt also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her. However, the bulk of the Bandlewood expansion should focus on yordles and their mischief. Beyond the Bandlewood is set to release on Aug. 25.",

The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. \nThe “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. \nIn the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.\nSimilar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. \nThe mod doesn't add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!",

Coca-Cola and State Farm are re-considering their partnerships with the League in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the state of California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of widespread sexual harassment and discrimination.\nAs reported by the Washington Post, two of the Overwatch League’s major sponsors are “re-assessing” their relationship with the League. State Farm and Coca Cola are two of the League’s seven sponsors listed on their website, along with IBM, Xfinity, Cheez-It, Pringles, and TeamSpeak.\nBrand deals are one of the ways to measure success for a competitive ecosystem like the Overwatch League. The League lost T-Mobile as a sponsor on Tuesday, and it appears as though others may soon follow.\nIn a statement to the Post, a representative of State Farm said that the insurance provider was “reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League” and the company has requested that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.” A spokesperson for Coca-Cola shared a similar sentiment, saying that the company is “aware of the allegations” and are working to “take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.”\nJ. Allen Brack, the head of Blizzard Entertainment, stepped down from his position on Tuesday, with Jen ONeal and Mike Ybarra taking his place as co-leaders. Jesse Meschuk, SVP and senior people officer at Activision-Blizzard, also reportedly left the company this week. Activision-Blizzard employees have been organizing in the face of the company’s response to the lawsuit, including 2,600 signatures on an open letter from past and present employees, and a staged a walkout at Blizzard’s California office and online.\nPolygon has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment and will update this post should we receive new information.",

Players will need to complete their various tasks while the secretly selected, titular double agents will need to sabotage the match. The investigator player will need to put the clues together to help the rest of the operatives survive.\nImage: Treyarch/Activision\n  \nMultiplayer also sees the return of the Demolition game mode. Season 5 will feature five maps as part of its multiplayer update, including some players have seen before: Echelon, Slums, Showroom, Drive-In, and Zoo. \nWarzone will get some new features as well. Players can play the new Clash game mode, which features Quad squads battling it out deathmatch-style. New points of interest, including Broadcast Stations, will appear around the map as well, and the Gulag is getting a makeover. Warzone will also see two new perks with Tempered and Combat Scout.\nThe Zombies mode will see a major update with season 5. Players will get their hands on a grapple gun, a tank, and a new region called Collateral. Players can also check out a new game mode called Transport. The update includes a new perk, Death Perception, and a new field upgrade called Tesla Storm.\nFinally, season 5 will add five new weapons: the EM2 assault rifle, the TEC-9 SMG, a new handgun called the Marshall, a cane, and a new scorestreak that comes in the shape of a flamethrower. As always, season 5 will add a variety of operators, a new battle pass, and a mid-season event. \nSeason 5 starts Aug. 12.",

Finally, there’s the Investigator, who will get special clues to help them determine the double agents and can put out Wanted Orders on players they suspect have betrayed their allies. \nThe mode will feature a variety of extra features, including weapons that players can collect throughout the early stages of a match, and certain extra tools for the double agents, to help give them a leg up on their targets. The mode will also heavily use voice chat to help players identify who among them seems the most suspicious. \nDouble Agent will be part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s season 5 update, which is set to be released on Aug. 12.",

This update will roll out free to those who already own Art of Rally on PC, and be included in the new console versions at their launch on Aug. 12.\nFunselektor said back in May that it expects a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5 release this summer also, but it does not yet have a launch date to share.\nThe Kenya Update adds four new cars, two new songs, six more stages with locations referencing Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, a free-roaming map set in the Kenya environment, and even local wildlife. Zebras, giraffes, and elephants will highlight the wide-open savanna.\nArt of Rally launched Sept. 23, 2020 on Windows PC and MacOs via Steam.

The game was previously scheduled to launch at the end of August, but the new release date is Sept. 28, 2021. \nThis is the most recent of multiple delays for the game. “We know that this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer,” the developers said. “But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.” The team cited feedback from the closed beta as a factor in pushing back the game. \nYou can read the full statement on New World’s Twitter page here.\nA message from the New World team. pic.twitter.com/oAZdK7dxTn\n— New World (@playnewworld) August 4, 2021\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned delays started in April, where the studio cited problems created by the coronavirus lockdowns. In July 2020, the studio announced that the game would be delayed to spring 2021. Then, in February 2021, the studio delayed it once more to August, 2021. The original target date was May, 2020. \nNew World is an MMO where you’re tasked with colonizing a fictional landmass in the Atlantic. The game features 50-on-50 fights where entire groups clash to take the land. Amazon previously hosted a preview event with thousands of players to gather feedback. Then, it became a chaotic attempt to simulate mid-1600s war. \nNew World is one of three PC games announced by Amazon Game Studios at TwitchCon 2016. However, delays and cancellations have impacted all three titles. Their multiplayer brawler Breakaway was canceled during development. Their other title, Crucible launched in May 2020, only for the studio to un-release the game and bring it back into a closed beta. The team later ceased development of Crucible in October.",

You can get an in-depth look at those new DLC fighters in Capcom’s Street Fighter 5 summer update video below.\n\n\nThose three DLC characters are included in Street Fighter 5’s season 5 pass, and each one can be purchased separately for MSRP $5.99 or 100,000 Fight Money, SF5’s earnable in-game currency.\nLuke “will help expand the world of Street Fighter and provide fans with a glimpse into the future,” Capcom teased in a news release. That’s likely a reference to the next Street Fighter, which is reportedly due sometime in 2022, based on details leaked from a ransomware attack on Capcom in 2020. That leak outed references to Street Fighter 6 arriving in the third quarter of 2022, followed by Super Street Fighter 6 and Ultra Street Fighter 6 in the years following. Capcom has not officially announced any of those projects, and plans may have changed since then.\nThe latest version of Capcom’s flagship fighting game series, Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.",

On top of that, it’s even possible that this new broadcast signal could be teasing some kind of mind-control Killstreak, but we’ll have to wait for more information to find out. \nWith season 5 on the way soon, Treyarch and Raven Software will probably tease new features over the next several days before everything is revealed early next week.",

These missions can be acquired from open world contacts, and sometimes they can go peacefully, but other times cowboys might need to apply a little bit of violence.\nFinally, a new game mode will launch on Aug. 10 called Call to Arms, in which players protect local townsfolk by fighting off waves of enemies.

A new update adds a new car, two new tracks, and streets filled with zombies (and zombie cows) to plow through. Wreckfest’s latest tournament borrows its visuals from the original Carmageddon, a pixelated mess by modern standards, which gives it a sense of charm.\nWreckfest players will be able to race through two vintage Carmageddon tracks (Bleak City and Death Canyon) and ride in the sawblade-adorned Eagle R car, which appeared in 2016’s Carmageddon: Max Damage.\nThe action is certainly less sadistic than the original Carmageddon, which awarded players bonus points for running over innocent pedestrians. Wreckfest’s version of vehicular homicide is more about cleaning up the streets of undead, with palatable splashes of green, pixelated blood splashing across the screen.\nWreckfest is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Monday’s announcement said Containment is “inspired by the upcoming game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction,” which was re-titled from Rainbow Six Quarantine during an E3 2021 reveal in June.\nContainment will take place on a reworked version of the Consulate map. In-game, the building is overrun by the Chimera parasite, whose outbreak forms the narrative context of Extraction. It was also the basis of Operation Chimera, an expansion for Siege that launched in 2018, which introduced a cooperative event called Outbreak.\nContainment’s new playlist is called Nest Destruction. Players will get a look at REACT, the faction that will be doing most of the cleanup in Extraction. In Nest Destruction, the Attackers are REACT agents (a news release in July said Rainbow operators Ash, Mira, and Thermite formed this squad). The Defenders are alien shapeshifters who look like REACT teammates, but can only use melee attacks. Attackers are there to destroy the nest, Defenders are there to destroy the Attackers.\nContainment will offer 33 unique items, including uniforms and weapon skins, for operators IQ, Ace, Blackbeard, Amaru, Zero, Aruni, Jager, Kaid, Mira, and Warden. These items are available in Siege’s shop for 1680 R6 credits, or in Containment Packs that run 300 R6 credits or 12,500 renown.\nRainbow Six Extraction was originally expected to launch Sept. 16, but in mid-July, Ubisoft announced it was postponing that release until January 2022. Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions on Amazon Luna and Google Stadia.",

          "description": "Image: Turn 10 Studios/Xbox Game Studios\n    \n\n  \nOwn the game? You won’t lose it.\n Forza Motorsport 7 is a relatively young game, having only been released in 2017. Today, Microsoft announced that the game is about to reach “End of Life” status, which means it’ll be unavailable to purchase on the Microsoft Store or through Xbox Game Pass after Sept. 15. Players who already own the game will be able to download and play the game as normal, including multiplayer and other online services. Microsoft will also continue to run Rivals esports events with partners.\nPlayers who own DLC for the game but access the main game through Xbox Game Pass will not be locked out of the game either. Microsoft explains how these cases will be handled. The post reads, in part:\nFor any Xbox Game Pass players who previously purchased DLC for the game, but not the game itself, we have good news! You will receive a token for the game through the Xbox Message Center so that you can continue playing Forza Motorsport 7. Token distribution will be through August 2. However, if after that date you have not received your token, please contact Xbox Support here. (Unused tokens will expire on September 15, 2023.)\nIf you know someone who has yet to play Forza Motorsport 7, we are offering a discount on the game in the Microsoft Store through September 15.\nThe next game in the series, which is simply called Forza Motorsport, currently has no release date, although it will come to Xbox Game Pass on day one.",

          "description": "Image: Square Enix\n    \n\n  \nIt’s a start\n Fans don’t like the teeny, tiny font in the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, but that’s not stopping them from fixing it.\nOn Wednesday Square Enix released the Pixel Remasters of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 2, and Final Fantasy 3 on Android, iOS, and Windows PC. The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.\nIt started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. \nSome held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. \nAs it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.\nPolygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.",

Psyonix said in a news release that more of James Bond’s vehicle fleet will be made available later this year. This is all presumably a tie-in with No Time to Die, the latest Bond flick, which was originally due to premiere in 2020 but was delayed repeatedly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film, Daniel Craig’s last as Bond, will be released Sept. 30.\nIn Rocket League, the Aston Martin DB5 uses the Octane hitbox. It does not come equipped with pop-out machine guns, a rotating license plate, a rear-window bullet shield, or an ejection seat. But it does have a rocket boost, and it drives around with the real DB5’s signature engine note.\nThe car is part of a bundle that includes 007’s Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, although they can only be equipped on this car. Buyers also get the Reel Life Decal.\nRocket League last crossed over with Hollywood in June with a three-car Fast & Furious bundle, each of which also offered a Reel Life Decal.",

After hitting it hard here during the first year of the pandemic1 — especially in the first several months — I’ve slowed up a bit this summer to give myself some space to recuperate and reconnect with other areas of my life. That’s been nice & necessary and I’m thankful to have a work situation that allows me to do that, but I plan to be back here in September with a renewed vigor. I hope you have a nice rest of your summer (or winter — I see you southern hemisphere) and I’ll see you back here soon. Stay safe, everyone.\n\n“The first year of the pandemic” — even just writing that tightens the chest.↩\n\nTags: kottke.org",

With the much more contagious Delta variant in play and an increasing number of breakthrough infections, the efficacy of these vaccines that we thought were amazing maybe aren’t? (Or maybe we just need to readjust our expectations?) But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing & preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:\n\nEven with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention. These vaccines work, we’re lucky to have them, and we need to get as many people worldwide as we can vaccinated as quickly as we can.

          "description": "Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.\nThe painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.\nBut when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.\nFollowing further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.\n\n\nThere is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?\nTags: art   Johannes Vermeer",

Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States — and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours — life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years.

I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother.

Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.\nEmbracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?\n\n\nYou can order the book from Bookshop. (via colossal)\nTags: architecture   books   Evergreen Architecture",

The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”\n\n\nThe Debt Project is also available in book form.\nTags: Brittany Powell   finance   Margaret Talbot   photography",

A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”\n\n\nYou can follow Wick’s continuing photo adventures on Instagram.\nTags: Alan Taylor   Bob Wick   photography",

My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: \nIn Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”\nIn Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)\n\n\nYou can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.\nTags: audio   cities   music   subway   Ted Green",

          "description": "For The Atlantic, Katherine Wu writes about the difficulty of communicating how vaccines work and how they protect individuals and communities from disease: Vaccines Are Like Sunscreen… No, Wait, Airbags… No, Wait…\nUnfortunately, communal benefit is harder to define, harder to quantify, and harder to describe than individual protection, because “it’s not the way Americans are used to thinking about things,” Neil Lewis, a behavioral scientist and communications expert at Cornell, told me. That’s in part because communal risk isn’t characteristic of the health perils people in wealthy countries are accustomed to facing: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer. Maybe that’s part of why we gravitate toward individual-focused comparisons. Slipping into a pandemic-compatible, population-based frame of mind is a big shift. In the age of COVID-19, “there’s been a lot of focus on the individual,” Lewis told me. That’s pretty at odds “with how infection works.”\n\n\nAs someone who has struggled with analogizing the virus & vaccines, I was nodding my head a lot while reading this. Something I’ve noticed in recent years that Wu didn’t get into is that readers desire precision in metaphors and analogies, even though metaphor is — by definition! — not supposed to be taken literally. People seem much more interested in taking analogies apart, identifying what doesn’t work, and discarding them rather than — more generously and constructively IMO — using them as the author intended to better understand the subject matter. The perfect metaphor doesn’t exist because then it wouldn’t be a metaphor.\nTags: Covid-19   Katherine Wu   language   medicine   science   vaccines",

          "description": "In an issue of his newsletter, The Convivial Society, L.M. Sacasas posed 41 questions that we should ask ourselves about technologies to help us “draw out the moral or ethical implications of our tools”. Here are a few of the questions:\n3. How will the use of this technology affect my experience of time?\n\n\nSacasas recently joined Ezra Klein on his podcast to talk through some of the answers to these questions for certain technologies.\nEZRA KLEIN: I’m gonna group the next set together. So what was required of other human beings, of other creatures, of the earth, so that I might be able to use this technology? When you ask that, when you think of that, what comes to mind?\nMICHAEL SACASAS: So I recently wrote a piece, and its premise was that sometimes we think of the internet, of digital life, as being immaterial, existing somewhere out in the ether, in the cloud, with these metaphors that kind of suggest that it doesn’t really have a material footprint. But the reality of course — I think as most of us are becoming very aware — is that it very much has a material reality that may begin in a mine where rare earth metals are being extracted in inhumane working conditions at great cost to the local environment.\nBut that’s very far removed from my comfortable experience of the tablet on my couch in the living room. And so with regards to the earth, the digital realm depends upon material resources that need to be collected. It depends on the energy grid. It leaves a footprint on the environment.\nAnd so we tend not to think about that by the time that it gets to us and looks so shiny and clean and new, and connects us to this world that isn’t physically necessarily located anywhere in our experience. And so I think it is important for us to think about the labor, the extraction cost on the environment, that go into providing us with the kind of world that we find so amusing and interesting and comfortable.\n\n\n Tags: Ezra Klein   L.M.

          "description": "One of the many effects of human-driven climate change is that, on average, the bodies of animals are getting smaller — birds, fish, deer, frogs, rodents, insects. And these changes could have large and unpredictable consequences.\n“That’s the problem with human-driven climate change. It’s the rate of change that’s just orders of magnitude faster than what the natural world has had to deal with in the past. Size is really important to survival, and you can’t just change that indefinitely without consequence. For one thing, I don’t think it’s feasible that species are going to be able to continue to get smaller and maintain things like a migration from one hemisphere to another.”\nAnd since smaller bodies can hold fewer eggs, they result in fewer offspring, and a lower population size in the long run. For amphibians who need to keep their skin wet in order to breathe, shrinking can mean higher chances of drying out in a drought because their bodies absorb and hold smaller quantities of water.\nBut the more concerning consequences have to do with how this could destabilize relationships between species. Because shrinking plays out at different rates for different species, predators might have to eat more and more of shrinking prey, for example, throwing a finely-tuned ecosystem off balance.\n\n\n Tags: global warming   science   video",

This is the prototype of curiosity — the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.\n2. Deprivation Sensitivity. This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.\n3.

          "description": "The YouTube channel In Depth Cine has been looking at how directors like Spike Lee, Alfonso Cuarón, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson shoot films at three different budget levels, from the on-a-shoestring films early in their careers to later blockbusters, to see the similarities and differences in their approaches. For instance, Wes Anderson made Bottle Rocket for $5 million, Rushmore for $10 million, and Grand Budapest Hotel for $25 million:\n\nSteven Spielberg shot Duel for $450,000, Raiders of the Lost Ark for $20 million, and Saving Private Ryan for $70 million:\n\nChristopher Nolan did Following for $6,000, Memento for $9 million, and Inception for $160 million:\n\nYou can find the full playlist of 3 Budget Levels videos here. (This list really needs some female directors — Ava DuVernay, Sofia Coppola, and Kathryn Bigelow would be easy to do, for starters. And Chloé Zhao, after The Eternals gets released.)\nTags: Christopher Nolan   film school   movies   Steven Spielberg   video   Wes Anderson",

          "description": "In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.\nCognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.\nThe power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.\n\n\nI particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:\nDaily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.\n\n\nFor more information on how caffeine enabled the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, check out Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses.\nTags: books   drugs   Michael Pollan   This Is Your Mind on Plants",

          "description": "For the FT, Tim Harford writes about things that could have been invented far sooner than they actually were.\nConsider the bicycle. It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.\nAnton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.\nSteven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.\n\n\n Tags: Tim Harford",

Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. \nIt is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.\n\n\nKurzgesagt founder Philipp Dettmer is publishing a companion book to the series, Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive; it’s out in late September.\nI have read a lot about the human immune system over the past 18 months, but this video was still helpful in understanding how it all fits together.

          "description": "The 2020 Summer Olympics are over, but it’s never too late to find inspiration in the athletes who competed. For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.\n“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”\n\n\nArmanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:\nThose distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”\n\n\n(thx, pete)\nTags: 2020 Summer Olympics   Lizzie Armanto   Nathan Fitch   Olympic Games   skateboarding   sports   video",

But practically, how big is the biggest, heaviest black hole in the universe? (A: More massive than the entire Milky Way.)\nThe largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like planets or stars they have no physical size limit, and can literally grow endlessly. Although in reality specific things need to happen to create different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single things in the universe. So how do black holes grow and how large is the largest of them all?\n\n\nVideos about space are where Kurzgesagt really shines. I’ve seen all their videos about black holes and related objects, and I always pick up something I never knew whenever a new one comes out.

In a review of Angie Schmitt’s 2020 book Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America for the New York Review of Books, Peter Baker explores why America is increasingly hostile to pedestrians. Part of the reason is the rise of SUVs (and one would assume, trucks) in the US:\nIn the 1980s SUVs were a rarity. It was only in 2015 that they started outselling sedans.

I remember coming home from school that day and watching the events unfold on television, completely shocked at how quickly it had all happened. Politics & protests had been pushing the Eastern Bloc countries toward more openness for years, but before watching this video, I’d never heard that the catalyst for that world-changing event was a short mistaken statement at the end of an otherwise boring press conference. From the BBC:\nEast German leaders had tried to calm mounting protests by loosening the borders, making travel easier for East Germans. They had not intended to open the border up completely.\nThe changes were meant to be fairly minor — but the way they were delivered had major consequences.\nNotes about the new rules were handed to a spokesman, Günter Schabowski — who had no time to read them before his regular press conference. When he read the note aloud for the first time, reporters were stunned.\n“Private travel outside the country can now be applied for without prerequisites,” he said. Surprised journalists clamoured for more details.\nShuffling through his notes, Mr Schabowski said that as far as he was aware, it was effective immediately.\nIn fact it had been planned to start the next day, with details on applying for a visa.\nBut the news was all over television — and East Germans flocked to the border in huge numbers.\n\n\nHow did the Berlin Wall fall? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\nTags: Berlin Wall   Cold War   Germany   politics   video",

The canoe is usually leaned over to the side to help the boat turn sharply and efficiently and paddle strokes are taken on either side of the canoe depending on the individual move. Balance, paddle placement and turn initiation are a few keys to this control. Since the movements seem dance-like, some practice this art timed to music, which is the ultimate in control.\n\n\nThe vest & bow tie, the choice of music (The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh), his control of the canoe — it’s all perfect.\nSee also It’s Reflective Fjord Season, Watch As a Master Woodworker Turns a Giant Log into an Elegant Dugout Canoe, and Kayaking Down a Drainage Ditch.

The ladles pour the molten metal into these molds. Once the metal is poured and cooled, the sand molds get placed into a shake-out machine that shakes the sand away from the pan, and then into an enormous drum to shake off the rest. The pans are finally put on a giant conveyor belt to be sorted and inspected. Any pans that are not up to muster get thrown back into the original scrap heap to be melted down again and remade into another pan.\n\n\nIn comparison, here’s how Borough Furnace makes their cast iron pans by hand in their much smaller workshop:\n\nVery similar process, down to the sand molds, just on a much smaller and more hands-on scale.\nTags: cooking   how to   video",

Playing in the 1970s, before the enforcement of Title IX in athletics, the 6’3” Harris dominated in high school, led a small university to three consecutive national basketball championships in the first 5 years of the program (while averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds per game), scored the first basket in Olympics women’s basketball history, is the only woman ever officially drafted by an NBA team, and was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. And those aren’t even her proudest achievements — you’ll have to watch the video for that.\nFor an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals — but Harris’s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot’s “The Queen of Basketball,” Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.\n\n\nThis video is part of the NY Times’ Almost Famous series, which also includes stories about radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell and actress/singer Kim Hill.\nTags: basketball   Ben Proudfoot   Lusia Harris   sports   video",

The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.\n\n\nYou can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.\nTags: Lora Webb Nichols   photography",

The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:\nThis was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.\n\n\nAfter more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now.

Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.\nAs someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.\nTags: TikTok   video",

The picture is a little more muddy when you look at the rates at the county level:\n\nThe “conservatives are unvaxxed” trend is still there, but a lack of access and education around the vaccines in counties with large Black and Latino populations also plays a large role in whether people are vaccinated or not.\nTags: Charles Gaba   Covid-19   infoviz   politics   vaccines",

          "description": "As I’ve written before, in the history of astronomy and astrophysics, women have made major discoveries and played a significant role in advancing our understanding of the universe but have often not gotten the recognition their male peers enjoy. In 1967, while she was working on her doctoral research with her advisor Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell Burnell (then Jocelyn Bell) discovered a new and unusual kind of object, the pulsar. In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.\nIn 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.\nIt’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.\nTags: Antony Hewish   astronomy   Ben Proudfoot   Jocelyn Bell Burnell   Nobel Prize   physics   science   sexism",

          "description": "For Vox, Emily Stewart writes about the shortcomings of the, er, system we’ve developed here in America of outsourcing public needs to private industry: Corporations aren’t going to save America.\nAcross various segments of American life, the private sector has begun to take on tasks big and small that one might think should be tackled by the public sector. Domino’s filled in potholes. Dawn’s dish soap saved ducks. American Express pitched in on historic preservation. Walmart started selling low-priced insulin. A slew of companies help workers pay for school. Much of America’s health care system is still handled through private insurers and your job. As people lose faith in government to act on sweeping issues such as climate change and guns, they’re increasingly looking to corporate America and asking whether there’s something they can do about it. If Congress won’t tackle gun violence, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods can try.\nIt’s not a bad thing for brands and companies to try to make the world better. Starting a business often involves identifying a problem to solve, and it’s much better for companies to help than to do harm. Corporate social responsibility is fine. There are, however, limits.\n“Of course we want businesses to be responsible,” said Suzanne Kahn, managing director of research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. But she emphasized that this does not constitute a plan for how to organize society. “Private companies don’t, can’t, or won’t plan with the same values that we demand and expect the government to.”\n\n\n(via the morning news)\nTags: business   Emily Stewart   USA",

So Nissan teamed up with sound designers at Bandai Namco, the gaming company known for Pac-Man and Tekken, to replace those warning noises with something more musical.\n\nI had a car once that beeped really sharply and loudly whenever the temperature dropped to 37°F as a warning for potential slippery roads and it scared the shit out of me every time.

          "description": "Since 2001, performance art group Improv Everywhere have been staging events in public, aiming to “surprise and delight random strangers through positive pranks”. Their latest endeavor takes place in NYC, perhaps the best place on Earth for exposing random strangers to positive pranks. A man in an orange vest places a “Stand Here for Dance Party” sign on the ground and then walks away. A brave soul steps onto the sign and, well, you might guess what happens next.\nI found this via Rob Walker’s newsletter about his book, The Art of Noticing. I love what he wrote about it:\nNow that you’ve seen it, you know that once someone did stand on the decal, a squad of Improv Everywhere operatives, with boom boxes and impressive dance moves, converted the public space into (as promised) an open-air dance party. Very fun.\nBut here’s what makes this work: Not just the planning and the expert performers and the slick choreography and the clever subversion of social-distance design. None of that matters unless somebody stands on the decal. What activates this entire operation is curiosity.\n\n\nHe continues, describing the woman who gets the party started:\nThis woman is my hero! I love everything about her, her body language, her openness, the thrilling sense she radiates that anything could happen and she’s up for it. And if you’ve watched the video, you know that she in fact unleashed an experience that she (and many strangers nearby) will never forget.\nWhat’s not in the video, but we know is true, is some huge majority of people not even noticing, or actively ignoring, the invitation to an impromptu, on-the-spot dance party. As always, attention is the first step.\n\n\nCuriosity. Attention. There are those words again, the universe trying to tell me something.\nTags: dance   Improv Everywhere   NYC   Rob Walker   video",

          "description": "Michael Buckley:\nmacOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.\nThis is the primary reason Retrobatch isn't sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I've considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can't bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.\nEvery year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.\nSee also this really old radar: rdar://13006144: Sandbox and limitation on number of files that can be opened from a user.",

          "description": "Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nFinally, no more uncertainty.\n After a long, arduous battle over the stipulations of his new contract this offseason, Travis Sanheim finally agreed to a new contract with the Flyers: two years at a $4.675 million AAV. This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.\n\n\nSanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.\nImage via Evolving-Hockey.com\n      Sanheim’s three year player card.\n  \nThe Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:\nBarring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That's the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can't fit 23 without moving somebody out.\n— Charlie O'Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021\n\n\n\nWith the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.",

Tuomaala spent the 2020-21 season with Kärpät’s U20 team, where he put up 31 points (15 goals and 16 assists) in 30 regular season games, and four points (1G, 4A) in five playoff games. He also represented Finland in the U18 World Championship, and he recorded 11 points (5G, 6A) in seven games, leading his team in scoring. \nIn short: he’s good, gang! Here’s what Flyers’ AGM Brent Flahr and Director of European Scouting Joakim Grundberg had to say about him. \n“He’s a guy we targeted. We kind of thought he would probably go at the end of the first or somewhere in the 20s and he fell. A real talented winger. Great skater. Real dynamic speed. Loves to shoot the puck. Talented kid. He’s going to take a little time to get stronger and put on a little weight. A talented kid that has real good offensive upside.” - Flahr\n“Obviously very excited getting him. He was rated as a first round talent. We were able to get him in the middle of the second round, so we’re really excited about that. To us, he has elite speed and high skill. Very good shot. High-offensive upside. There’s things he’s got to work on like his overall game and obviously getting stronger. We’re really excited. We see a lot of upside there.” - Grundberg\nNow, it may still be a little while before we see Tuomaala make the jump over to North America. He’s slated to join Kärpät (Liiga) next season, and this ELC can slide to allow that to happen. But he’s locked in with the Flyers all the same, and it’s a bit of housekeeping taken care of.",

At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.\nHe was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. \nSeeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.",

With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.\nClendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. \nPhiladelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.",

The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange & Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.\nThompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.\nWith this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.",

Widner/NHL/Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nWell, there’s your backup goalie.\n After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.\nJones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.\nSince the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.\nThis article may be updated.",

[The Athletic]\n*Chuck’s done a lot of adding on the back end, a little tweaking to the top end, but what are we looking at in the middle? [BSH]\n*Anyway, let’s talk about Cam Atkinson. Let’s let his excitement infect us all. [BSH]\n*Oh yeah by the way, the Capitals signed Alex Ovechkin to five more years. Dude’s 100% definitely getting that record. It’s going to be so neat. [Japers’ Rink]\n*The Vegas Golden Knights traded Marc-Andre Fleury — he just won the Vezina, in case you forgot — for... nothing. Nothing. [Knights On Ice]\n*And finally, a new Flyperbole!
