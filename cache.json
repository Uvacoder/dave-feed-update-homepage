This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible. We still recommend you start using node-version: \"16\" in your .github/workflows/update-feed.yaml today to get the performance/security improvements from the newer node. See example\nChore: Reorganize to monorepo with npm workspace.",
