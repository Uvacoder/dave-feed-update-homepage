Rumors about the ‚ÄåApple Car‚Äå have suggested that leadership issues and internal strife have impacted the project, which is perhaps no surprise given what a massive undertaking it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to bringing the Apple Watch to fruition, Lynch worked at Adobe and helped create Creative Cloud, plus he has worked on Apple's healthcare strategy team, so he has a diverse background. Business Insider says that his title will not change and he will continue to be involved with both the Apple Watch and Apple's health initiatives, but he is stepping back from Jeff Williams' health care staff and will be replaced by director of health software engineering Evan Doll on that team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is now at a stage where it is sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the ‚ÄåApple Car‚Äå, requiring more hands-on help from experienced executives within Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork on an ‚ÄåApple Car‚Äå is still in the early stages and multiple sources have said that a finished self-driving vehicle could be released sometime between 2025 to 2028.

          "description": "Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that it will begin mass production operations at its new factory in Arizona in 2024, Nikkei Asia reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC Chairman Mark Liu announced that the company's $12 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona, which is currently under construction, will begin mass production in the first quarter of 2024. While the 2024 timeframe had previously been rumored by Bloomberg, TSMC's announcement serves as a confirmation and indicates that the project is on track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first batch of engineers hired to staff the new U.S. factory arrived in Taiwan in late April this year for training, and the company is looking to accelerate its schedule for the facility as much as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility will mass-produce chips fabricated with a 5nm process. TSMC has been gradually miniaturizing its process over the years, going from a 16nm A10 chip in iPhone 7 models, to a 7nm A13 chip in iPhone 11 models, and most recently a 5nm process for the iPhone 12's A14 chip. Likely clients for the chips made in the Arizona factory include Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple. The new Arizona plant will make it theoretically possible for Apple's 5nm custom silicon chips, such as the A14 or M1 chip, to be manufactured within the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTSMC's main factories are located in Taiwan, but it already operates a factory in Camas, Washington, as well as design centers in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California, meaning that the Arizona facility will be its second manufacturing site in the United States. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside the news about the Arizona factory, TSMC also said that it was looking into chip production sites in Japan, likely for chips destined for Sony devices, and set out the intention to build up overseas manufacturing capacity to ensure long-term competitiveness.\nTags: TSMC, Arizona\nThis article, \"Apple's Chip Partner TSMC to Begin Mass Production of 5nm Chips at New Arizona Factory in 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As pandemic-related restrictions ease in the United States, the Chicago-based research firm said increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Apple did very well as it emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Josh Lowitz, a CIRP co-founder. \"Increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models as they retired older phones and shopped more at Apple's own retail locations to buy those iPhones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shift to more expensive models resulted in the iPhone's average selling price in the United States rising to $869 in the June 2021 quarter, added Lowitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research note also indicates that Apple experienced a significant increase in iPhone sales through its retail operations, including both physical stores and online. In the June 2021 quarter, 27% of iPhone sales in the United States were completed through Apple, compared to a previous high of 21% in September 2020, according to CIRP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRP bases its findings on its survey of 500 customers in the United States who purchased an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch in the April-June 2021 period.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro\nTag: CIRP\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 12 (Caution), iPhone 12 Pro (Caution)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 12 Pro Max Seeing Strong Demand in U.S. as Consumer Spending Rises\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "ElevationLab, known for its range of useful accessories for Apple's devices, today introduced the MagBase, which is designed to increase the functionality of Apple's MagSafe Charger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $9.95, the MagBase is a small attachment that fits onto the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger. It has a micro air suction surface at the bottom, which ElevationLab has used in prior products. This micro air suction is not adhesive, but it's quite strong and is able to keep the MagBase securely attached to a desk or a table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagBase has multiple functions when used with a ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger. If you pull upwards on an iPhone that's on the MagBase, the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå charger will come up, which is useful if you need to check something while still continuing to charge. When you're done, it can be set right back in the MagBase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to pick up the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and leave the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger attached to the MagBase, you can use a quick slide gesture to remove the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå, which leaves the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger right where it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of the MagBase adds on an additional 3-ft USB-C cord that attaches to the USB-C end of the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger, so you have more cord to work with when using it at a desk. It increases the length of the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger cable from three feet to six feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the MagBase is barely larger than the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger, it takes up minimal space while on a desk while also providing a useful and versatile base for housing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagBase can be purchased from the ElevationLab website for $9.95.\nThis article, \"ElevationLab's 'MagBase' Docks Your MagSafe Charger to Your Desk\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Tabs were also all arranged at the top of the display to minimize the space taken up at the top of a Safari window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ‚ÄåmacOS Monterey‚Äå, Apple has walked this back. There's a dedicated URL/search bar at the top of the Safari window, with the tabs arranged below it. Clicking on a tab makes it the active window and it's easier to drag tabs for rearranging or opening in a new window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's still quite far off from the current Safari design in ‚ÄåmacOS Big Sur‚Äå, but it's certainly an improvement over the initial ‚ÄåmacOS Monterey‚Äå design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new and separate tab bar is enabled by default when upgrading to ‚ÄåmacOS Monterey‚Äå beta three, but Apple has included an option to revert to the original Monterey design.

This technology allows for enhanced augmented reality experiences and other unique capabilities, such as the ability to measure a person's height instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple introduced the LiDAR scanner on the iPad Pro in March 2020, and later expanded it to the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. Since then, there have been conflicting rumors about whether Apple will bring the feature to all iPhone 13 models in 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DigiTimes report in January first suggested this was part of Apple's plans for its next flagship lineu‚Ä¶",

The updated ‚ÄåiPad Air‚Äå features no Home Button and an-all screen design. Gurman says the ‚ÄåiPad mini‚Äå 6 will feature a design \"similar\" to the current latest ‚ÄåiPad Air‚Äå.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple leaker Jon Prosser recently shared renders of what he claims to be the upcoming ‚ÄåiPad mini‚Äå. According to the leaker, the ‚ÄåiPad mini‚Äå will feature a Touch ID sensor embedded into the power button, a hardware change first introduced in the ‚ÄåiPad Air‚Äå. He also claims it will feature an A14 chip and a USB-C port rather than a Lightning port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is said to be releasing multiple products this fall, which alongside the annual iPhone and Apple Watch revamp, we're also expecting redesigned MacBook Pros and the sixth-generation ‚ÄåiPad mini‚Äå.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: Bloomberg\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Sixth-Generation iPad Mini With Smaller Bezels, Larger Display, and Improved Performance Expected to Launch This Fall\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In November, five months before Apple announced its new iPad Pro, the account stated that Apple would bring the M1 chip to its next-generation iPad, which turned out to be accurate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days before Apple's \"Spring Loaded\" event, which included the release of the redesigned 24-inch ‚ÄåiMac‚Äå, the account posted that the new Mac would feature an ‚ÄåM1‚Äå chip, rather than an upgraded \"M1X\" iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore recently, the account claimed that the \"M2\" chip will debut in updated and colorful MacBook Airs next year.

The NFL is looking to get more money when establishing a new deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESPN parent company Disney is said to be interested in acquiring the rights for the ESPN streaming service, and according to The Information, Apple is not seen as a serious contender for the rights because it has been reluctant to invest money in entertainment programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, Apple has an ongoing relationship with the National Football League, and in 2020, hired James DeLorenzo to run a sports division for ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå. DeLorenzo previously negotiated Amazon's deal with the NFL to stream live games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple previously held talks with the Pac-12 conference about live streaming college sports, but nothing ever came of those talks and there continues to be little sports-related content on ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquiring the rights to the NFL's Sunday Ticket package would draw a wider audience to ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå, appealing to those who live away from their favorite football teams.\nTags: NFL, Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple in Talks With NFL for Sunday Ticket Streaming\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The gift card is available on Apple's website in digital and physical versions, with the physical card sent by mail including a collectible Apple logo sticker available in five designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gift card's availability in Canada was alerted to us by MacRumors reader Basic Apple Guy, while 9to5Mac noticed Australia was added too.

The dates for each state differ, and the selection of states this year is relatively small. Only purchases made during a state's specific holiday are free of state sales tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy around each state also varies. Alabama, for example, which is holding its sales-free tax holiday between July 16 and 18, requires that the total sales price of all items must remain under $750. Apple products, including Macs, iPad, and the iPod touch, are eligible, alongside accessories such as keyboard, mice, the Apple Pencil, and more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMissouri, which is running its holiday between August 6 and 8, has a higher limit of $1500 and the addition of more accessories, including printers, routers, RAM upgrades, the Apple TV, and more. South Carolina, sharing a holiday with Missouri, has no limit and includes tax-free purchases of earbuds, headphones, and flash drives, however only for students. Virginia consists of a limit of only $60 for cell phone chargers and batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information on Apple's sales tax holiday, participating states and products, can be found on Apple's website. \nTag: Apple Store\nThis article, \"Apple Participating in Sales Tax Holiday for Select U.S. States\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

He then backs up his truck off the street, walks with his dog to a large haystack, and taps on a button in the Apple Watch's Control Center to ping his iPhone, which results in the iPhone playing a sound to help pinpoint its location if misplaced nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An iPhone that's lost is easily found,\" says Apple. \"Relax, it's iPhone + Apple Watch.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use this feature on the Apple Watch, swipe up to open Control Center and tap the Ping iPhone button, which will make the device chime. You can also touch and hold the Ping iPhone button to make the iPhone flash as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, if your iPhone isn't in range of your Apple Watch, you can track its location using the Find My app on another Apple device or iCloud.com.\nTag: Apple ads\nThis article, \"Rancher Uses Apple Watch to Find iPhone 12 in a Haystack in Apple's Latest Ad\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The domain name was previously owned by payments startup Mobeewave, which Apple acquired last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMobeewave created a system that lets shoppers tap a credit card or smartphone on another phone to process a payment. The technology works with NFC, which is built into all modern iPhones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple typically buys startups to turn their technology into features of its products, and the functionality could in future allow iPhones to be used as payment terminals with no additional hardware required. Apple hired the whole Mobeewave team, which includes dozens of employees, and the company is continuing to work from Montreal where it is based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the acquisition, Mobeewave demonstrated the simplicity of its technology by showing users inputting a transaction amount into an app and tapping an NFC-enabled card on the back of a smartphone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFull contact information on the domain transfer is redacted for privacy, but the record's domain information lists Apple's nameservers.

According to ITV, the match was watched by as many as 27.6 million people, making it one of the most-watched moments in the UK since the London 2012 Olympics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPortions of the tense second half of the match between England and Denmark were unwatchable on the ‚ÄåApple TV‚Äå due to a problem that repeatedly kicked viewers out of the stream. Upon attempting to reconnect, the app played a number of ads before resuming and being kicked out again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSo, the adverts play OK, but then #itvhub decides that it doesn't want to go. Then try again and same result... Good job there's nothing important on tonight, like say a sporting event.. pic.twitter.com/RNZilb3Urc\n‚Äî Steve Steer (@Somst_Fruitcake) July 7, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITV was the only way for UK viewers to watch the game, which likely resulted in unusually large numbers of people trying to join the stream via ITV Hub. Nevertheless, streaming from ITV Hub on other devices appeared to be unaffected. ITV has since apologized to viewers over the experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic Euro 2020 final between England and Italy will be streamed via both BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub in the UK on Sunday, which should reduce the load on the stream, and at least provide viewers with an alternative if one of them suffers from issues.

Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Nanoleaf Thread border router support also means Android users will be able to control the Essentials devices, too.

The Leather Cover is meant to slide over a ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger, providing a more attractive design for those who use Apple's charging solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leather Cover for ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå is available in rustic brown and black Horween leather, and each cover has a soft microfiber exterior that does not do any damage to the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNomad designed the Leather Cover to fit snugly to the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger, but it does add a little bit of extra size, which Nomad says makes the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charger easier to grip and remove from an iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike all of Nomad's leather products, the Leather Cover for ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå will develop a rich, unique patina over time with use. These Leather Covers also match well with Nomad's Leather ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå cases because it's the same material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNomad's Leather Cover for ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå is priced at $24.95 and can be purchased from the Nomad website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Nomad.

It's made from materials like plastic, aluminum, and a stitched fabric, and it feels like it has a durable build quality. The different pieces of the dock connect magnetically together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a Qi-based charging station for the iPhone and the ‚ÄåAirPods‚Äå, featuring a vertical Qi wireless charging spot for the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and a flat spot for the ‚ÄåAirPods‚Äå or AirPods Pro. Since this is just Qi, either of these spots can also be used for other devices too. For iOS devices, charging maxes out at 7.5W, but 10W charging is available for Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the side, there's a USB-C and and a USB-A port for charging additional devices, and you can use these with the laptop and tablet stand of the StudioCaddy. A MacBook or an iPad can fit into one of the StudioCaddy's storage slots, charging through the attached cables, which are sold separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tablet/laptop stand works with any size MacBook, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is convenient if you need an overnight storage spot. You can leave the StudioCaddy's pieces attached together magnetically or separate them out across your desk for a custom setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKensington is charging $179 for the StudioCaddy, which is expensive, but it is a solid multi-device charging station for those who need an all-in-one solution.

Described as a \"summer camp for billionaires,\" the annual media conference is hosted by private investment firm Allen & Company and allows media and tech moguls to negotiate deals in between leisure activities such as golfing and whitewater rafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook at a previous Sun Valley Conference\n\r\n\r\nVariety previously revealed the guest list for this year's conference. In addition to Cook and Zuckerberg, notable invitees included billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone, \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan, Dell CEO Michael Dell, and others. However, the report noted that not everyone on the guest list chooses to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being canceled last year due to the pandemic, the Sun Valley Conference returns this year with health and safety measures in place, with attendees required to present a negative PCR test result obtained within 72 hours prior to arrival, according to Vanity Fair. The report added that many presentations and events will take place outdoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook has attended the Sun Valley Conference multiple times, often alongside Apple's services chief Eddy Cue. While details are typically kept under wraps, it was recently reported that during a private meeting at the conference in 2019, Cook urged Zuckerberg to delete all user information Facebook had collected from third-party apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith so many media executives gathering in one place, the Sun Valley Conference likely provides Cook with an opportunity to negotiate Apple TV+ content deals.

          "description": "Twitter is considering letting users post select tweets for \"Trusted Friends\" only. That's the name of a feature the social media platform is testing that would allow users to limit the audience for specific content to a smaller circle of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on design concepts shared by the company (via TechCrunch), Trusted Friends could be a toggle that lets you indicate whether a tweet should be made public or be shown to just a handful of users. The idea is similar to Instagram's \"Close Friends\" feature, which lets users share personal Stories more privately. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing the option to Twitter would allow users who have multiple Twitter accounts separating their personal and professional lives to tweet from a single account and have greater control of who sees what on their timeline. It could also mean some users no longer have to toggle between public and protected tweets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter recently announced new ways for creators and influencers to deliver content to specific users who pay to access its \"Super Follow\" feature, and Trusted Friends feels like an experimental extension of the idea that would be available to all users. But it's just a concept for now, and there's no guarantee Twitter will ever take it live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther concepts Twitter says it is looking into include \"Facets,\" which would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all a user's tweets, or only those about the \"facet\" they're interested in, and an ability for users to list specific phrases that they don't want to see in replies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with Trusted Friends, neither of these features are currently in active development and Twitter is simply seeking feedback to gauge whether they're worth pursuing or not.\nTag: Twitter\nThis article, \"Twitter Considers Letting Users Tweet to 'Trusted Friends'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Salaries will remain constant regardless of where an employee is working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants in the Retail Flex program are being asked to participate for at least six months, with the initiative to ramp up from September to December when new devices are set to launch. Employees will be reimbursed for some internet expenses and will receive $100 to put toward office equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor corporate employees, Apple is implementing a work schedule that will see them returning to the office for three days a week starting in September. Some employees petitioned Apple for a more remote friendly work environment that would allow them to work from home permanently, but Apple's retail and people lead Deirdre O'Brien clarified that Apple's in-person work schedule is non-negotiable as in-person work is \"essential\" to Apple product development and company culture.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Stores\nTag: Apple retail\nRelated Forum: Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice\nThis article, \"Apple Developing Hybrid 'Retail Flex' Work From Home Program for Apple Store Employees\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The larger size of this bulb is necessitated by the need for additional passive cooling measures as the LED produces more heat when emitting more light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Philips Hue is seeking to expand its filament range of bulbs by introducing new E27 filament shapes in the White Ambiance range, with a maximum brightness of 550 lumens. There will also be a brand new E14 Hue White filament bulb for the European market, which will become the smallest filament lamp in the range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to hueblog.com, the new products will be officially unveiled at the end of August or the beginning of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the company is said to be exploring new Hue products with its Gradient lighting technology.

Obviously, Windows 11 won't be supported on Mac computers, but as is normal, some Mac users run virtualized desktops on their Mac with Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs reported by iMore, Parallels has confirmed that it is waiting to dig into Windows 11, once all of its features, such as Teams integration and Android apps, are released and part of the Windows 11 Preview build before they starting working on Mac compatibility. As per the report:\r\n\r\n\"Since Windows 11 has just been announced recently, the Parallels Engineering team is waiting for the official Windows 11 Insider Preview build to start studying changes introduced in the new OS to deliver full compatibility in future Parallels Desktop updates,\" Nick Dobrovolskiy, SVP of Engineering and Support told iMore. Microsoft's first Insider preview build came out on Monday, but the rollout was a bumpy one and it doesn't include all of the new features that are coming to Windows 11 later this year such as Microsoft Teams integration or support for Android apps.\n No specifics were given, but Parallels did say that it \"will surely do everything that's possible to make it happen.\" On Intel-based Mac computers, users can natively run Windows using Boot Camp, as well as through virtualization. However, running Windows natively through Boot Camp is no longer possible on all Apple silicon Macs, leaving virtualization to be the only option.\nTag: Parallels\nThis article, \"Windows 11 for Mac in the Works, Says Parallels Desktop\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In our experience, and based on other accounts from people who have tested the service, there's latency, sometimes bad and sometimes just sporadic. The lag doesn't make most games unplayable, but it does affect competitive online shooters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLatency can depend on connection, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming is fine if you have stellar internet speeds, but most reports so far suggest that it needs to be further refined for games where latency is a dealbreaker. We found we could adjust to the very slight delays for sports games and other titles, but with shooters, gameplay was hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the latency issues, we wouldn't recommend the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription strictly for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but if it's something that you already have, it's a great bonus feature. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate provides access to more than 100 games on Xbox, PCs, and mobile devices, plus same day release access to Xbox Game Studios titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can pay $1 to get three months of access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. After that three-month period, the subscription is priced at $14.99 per month.\nTags: Microsoft, Xbox\nThis article, \"Hands-On With Microsoft's Browser-Based Xbox Cloud Gaming Service on an iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Additionally, the company held its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where it announced major updates to all of its platforms coming to users this fall.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the second quarter, Apple recorded a March quarter record of $89.6 billion in revenue, while its Mac and Services business reached an all-time new high. As has been normal for the past year, Apple is not providing guidance for the June quarter given the instability fueled by the global health crisis. However, during the earnings call last quarter, Apple's CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects a \"sequential revenue decline\" for the June quarter.\r\n\r\nJune quarter revenues to grow strong double digits year over year, but we believe sequential revenue decline from March to June will be greater than prior years. First, due to later launch timing and strong demand, ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå only achieved supply/demand balance during the March quarter. Steeper sequential decline than usual. Supply constraints will have revenue impact of $3-4 billion.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern.

Since that report, however, Apple has seemed to change its outlook on the situation, potentially realizing that demand for the 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and expected demand for the upcoming MacBook Pro may exceed the capabilities of a single supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing its launch, Apple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå was rather limited in stock, with shipping times at the time of launch in April reaching mid and late July. Due to continued disruptions thanks to the global health crisis and global chip shortage, a similar scenario may be in practice with upcoming MacBook Pros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå was the first Apple product to feature the company's Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED, rather than traditional LCD or OLED.

Currently, mmWave ‚ÄåiPhone 12‚Äå models are only available in the United States, but this fall, Apple is planning a larger expansion of mmWave iPhones to more countries worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmmWave technology has increased in adoption in cities; however, with the ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå expanding the technology to more customers, it may push countries to adopt mmWave infrastructure faster. DigiTimes reports that Apple is planning to boost the ratio of 5G mmWave iPhones to as many as to 60% of its 2021 iPhone lineup, with shipments reaching 90 million units. \r\n\r\nApple is expected to sharply boost the ratio of 5G mmWave devices to 60% of its new ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup in 2021, with such models estimated to approach 90 million units, the sources said, adding that each mmWave ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå will require four AiP modules, significantly driving up demand for AiP substrates.\nThe ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå, expected to be announced between September and October, is rumored to include other significant features such as an improved display, improved cameras, and faster performance.

As of mid-May, Apple was reportedly on track to spend around $300 million on Google cloud storage services this year, which would represent an increase of roughly 50% from all of 2020.

Built into Xcode 13, Xcode Cloud offers a fast and simple way for developers and teams of all sizes to build, test, and deliver high-quality apps even more efficiently. Xcode Cloud can automatically build apps in the cloud to free up developers' Macs for other tasks. Parallel testing in the cloud means developers can test on a simulated version of every current Apple device, then easily deploy a build of the app for internal testing, or deliver to external beta testers through TestFlight for instant feedback.\nApple has been allowing developers to sign up for the Xcode Cloud waitlist prior to now, and there are multiple reports on Twitter from developers who have been granted beta access. All developers who are Account Holders in the Apple Developer Program as of June 7, 2021 are eligible to sign up for Xcode Cloud, though a Mac with the latest beta version of Xcode 13 is required.\nTags: Xcode, Apple Developer Program\nThis article, \"Apple Now Offering Developers Access to Xcode Cloud\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "We're just a few months away from when Apple is expected to reveal the 2021 iPhone, dubbed the \"iPhone 13.\" In preparation for its launch, it has been pulling in shipments of different components needed to produce the new iPhones, according to a report from DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn years past, Apple released its latest ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, alongside a new Apple Watch, during a September event at Apple Park. Due to the global health crisis last year, the company was forced to delay the launch of the iPhone 12 to October, one month off its typical release schedule. Despite the delay last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones on time in September, according to well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple operates under dozens of suppliers based in China, the United States, Vietnam, and India to produce its devices. Lockdowns crippled many of Apple's supplier's ability to produce and assemble devices. TSMC, one of Apple's largest suppliers, has reportedly already started producing the A15 chip for the 2021 iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iPhone 12 featured several changes, such as an updated flat-edged design, the introduction of LiDAR for the high-end Pro models, and improved cameras. Above all, however, Apple's largest selling point for the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå was the inclusion of 5G technology. For the upcoming iPhones, Apple may instead focus on marketing other aspects of the device, including an all-new always-on display with 120Hz ProMotion technology, improved cameras, and more. Check out our roundup to learn more about everything we're expecting. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: digitimes\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Begins Preparation for iPhone 13 Production Ahead of Fall Launch\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple and Asustek were tied for fifth place in IDC's rankings for computer brands in India in the quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a January earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that its India online store had received a \"tremendous\" response since opening, and that it had doubled Apple's smartphone share in the country to 4% in the December quarter. Cook said that as a result of the success, Apple was bringing forward plans to launch brick-and-mortar retail stores in the country. \nTags: digitimes.com, India\nThis article, \"Apple's Online Store in India Drives Significant Shipment Growth in Q1 2021\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

They're unlikely for next year‚Äîwith Apple's attention on a redesigned iPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022‚Äîand it's possible they never come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for many people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines between tablet and laptop.\nThe current iPad Pro comes in 11-inch and 12.9-inch display sizes. In a previous Bloomberg report, Gurman and Debby Wu said Apple is testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back that would support wireless charging for release in 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLarger display sizes would help further blur the lines between the iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro, which is available with up to a 16-inch display. However, many customers still believe iPadOS does not take full advantage of the iPad Pro's hardware, and Gurman opined that Apple ultimately needs to allow Mac apps and Mac-like multitasking with more flexible arrangements of app windows on the iPad Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last updated the iPad Pro in April with its custom-designed M1 chip, Thunderbolt support, 5G connectivity on cellular models, a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model, up to 2TB of storage, up to 16GB of RAM, and more. \nRelated Roundup: iPad Pro\nTag: Mark Gurman\nBuyer's Guide: 11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now), 12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Mark Gurman: Apple Exploring iPads With Larger Displays\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Despite recommendations to create strong, complicated, and advanced passwords for hotspot connections, many users continue to use simple passwords that may be easily guessed. WPA3 specifically targets such use cases, as it uses \"more resilient, password-based authentication\" that offers \"stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS and ‚ÄåiPadOS 15‚Äå are currently being tested with developers, with a public beta being planned for later this summer.

However, the company says it should be widely available \"over the coming weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the VPN, users can stream, browse, and download over an encrypted, private connection, which is especially important for unsecured public Wi-Fi.

Exclusive to paying iCloud+ subscribers, Private Relay is not being advertised as a VPN by Apple nor is it a like-for-like replacement for one, but it does encrypt Safari browser traffic and uses multiple relay \"hops\" or proxies to securely route that data and keep it private.\nTags: Google, Google Fi\nThis article, \"Google Fi VPN Starts Rolling Out to iPhone Users\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Following his company's reveal of Windows 11, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern to discuss the next generation of Windows and the possibility of Apple bringing some of its services, such as iMessage, to Windows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne major theme of Windows 11 is its openness to third-party app marketplaces and Microsoft's end goal of making the platform a center of creativity outside the bounds of its own Microsoft App Store. Windows 11 will allow users to run Android apps, but the integration with Windows and iPhone is lacking. In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would \"love to make sure that it works better,\" referencing the iPhone and Windows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives revealed that at one point in time, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform \"would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage. \nTags: iMessage, Windows\nThis article, \"Microsoft CEO Would 'Welcome' Apple to Bring iMessage to Windows\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Microsoft today held an event where it unveiled Windows 11, the next generation of Windows with a new design, new versatility capabilities, gaming improvements, and more. One notable announcement was that, starting with Windows 11, PCs will be able to run Android apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogically, Microsoft would partner with the Google Play Store to offer Android apps on its platforms. However, the company is taking a different route, partnering with Amazon to open Windows 11 to Android apps. As reported by The Verge, users will search for an Android app offered through the Amazon app marketplace directly within the newly redesigned Microsoft App Store. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroid apps will run on the platform using Intel's \"bridge technology.\" Like traditional Windows apps, Android apps can be added to the new centered Windows taskbar, pinned, and snapped to different multitasking modes. Specific details remain unknown, such as hardware requirements and developers' need to make their Android apps runnable on Windows 11. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's announcement draws comparisons to Apple's announcement with macOS Big Sur last year and its transition to Apple silicon. Thanks to Apple silicon and the common architecture shared among Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, macOS can now run ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå apps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite Apple's best intentions, the experience of running iOS apps on Apple silicon Macs has been rough due to Mac's input being fully trackpad and keyboard-based, compared to the direct touch experience the apps were initially designed for. Apple has attempted to solve the issue by introducing touch alternatives, which turn the Mac trackpad into a \"virtual touch screen.\" \nTag: Windows\nThis article, \"Windows 11 Will Run Android Apps From Amazon Appstore\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple may have tested \"Smart Bands\" for the Apple Watch, according to a new image of a prototype device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe image, shared by developer and prototype collector Giulio Zompetti, shows two metal contacts inside an Apple Watch Series 3 prototype's band slot, either side of the diagnostic port. Zompetti postulated that the \"two unusual pads are exposed to the band,\" and may be a kind of iPad-like \"Smart Connector,\" much like those from various iPad models, used to accommodate a \"Smart Band.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has filed a large number of patents around smart Apple Watch bands, indicating that it is something that the company has actively considered. Some patents showed how features such as biometric authentication, self-tightening, and LED progress indicators could be integrated into a band, while others explained a modular approach with batteries, displays, cameras, blood pressure sensors, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch's hidden diagnostic port was once speculated to facilitate Smart Bands. At the time, the diagnostic connector, which is purportedly based on the design of the Lightning connector, was said to be capable of supporting future accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird-party accessory makers were able to develop an external battery band that could charge the Apple Watch through the diagnostic port, but changes to the Apple Watch's software prevented the strap from ever coming to market. However, other smart bands not reliant on the diagnostic port have become available in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, Zompetti has shared images of prototype versions of the original Apple Watch, first-generation iPad, third-generation iPod touch, and iPhone 12 Pro.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Watch Series 3 Prototype May Show Contacts for Potential 'Smart Bands'\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now though, upon activating Google's Privacy Screen feature in v3.2.0 of the app, Face ID or ‚ÄåTouch ID‚Äå is needed in order to show newly generated codes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authentication requirement can be set to show immediately, after 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes.

Recently leaked battery capacities suggest that the entire lineup will feature larger batteries, possibly due in part to the higher power consumption needed for the higher variable refresh rate on the Pro models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones in September, in line with years prior to the global health crisis. Apple recently filed upcoming models of the iPhone into the EEC database, and Apple's suppliers are beginning to ramp up efforts to improve device production. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: Sonny Dickson\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Dummy Models Depict Repositioned Camera Modules\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Facebook users can also \"raise a hand\" to join a conversation, and use reactions to participate in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, Live Audio Rooms is set to receive more features that Clubhouse presently lacks, including notifications when friends or followers join a room and live captioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers can discover and join Live Audio Rooms within Facebook Groups. In private groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. Meanwhile, in public groups, both members and visitors can listen to the Live Audio Room, but in private groups, only members can listen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Audio Room hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the U.S.-basd public figures with first access to Live Audio Rooms are music artist TOKiMONSTA, football quarterback Russell Wilson, Internet personality Omareloff, and entrepreneur Amanda Nguyen.

The most common method is by receiving a normal iCloud calendar invitation through their calendar app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteracting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing \"Maybe,\" lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a video posted by Apple Support, that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation.

September is the usual month for Apple to unveil new iPhones, but the iPhone 12 lineup was announced in October last year due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have a smaller notch above the display, but will otherwise have a similar outward design as iPhone 12 models.\n\r\n\r\nThe devices will be powered by Apple's next-generation A15 chip manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm+ process.\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhones will be equipped with OLED displays, while the two Pro models will also feature a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother content.\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhones will have the same storage capacity options as their iPhone 12 counterparts. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models are available with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, while 12 Pro models have a 512GB option.\n\r\n\r\nThe rear camera system on all four iPhones will be equipped with sensor-shift image stabilization, a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. For the new Pro models, the Ultra Wide lens will gain autofocus.\n\r\n\r\nThe LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the Pro models.\nWith the pandemic showing signs of easing in the United States and Europe, TrendForce forecasted that annual iPhone production for 2021 will grow by around 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to 223 million units. The research firm believes the \"iPhone 12s\" lineup will account for nearly 40% of that total production volume.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: TrendForce\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"TrendForce: iPhone 13 Lineup Will Remain Limited to Maximum 512GB of Storage\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Relying on the proven FinFET transistor architecture for the best performance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness, N3 will offer up to 15% speed gain or consume up to 30% less power than N5, and provide up to 70% logic density gain.\nWhile the report doesn't offer any detail of how the new 3nm chip can be implemented into Apple products, it's safe to assume its still years away. Apple's 14 chip, currently in the iPhone 12 series and iPad Air, is based on the 5nm process. The M1 Apple silicon also shares the same 5nm architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe smaller process provides improved performance and energy efficiency and offer more freedom with product design, thanks to their smaller overall footprint. \nTags: TSMC, digitimes\nThis article, \"Apple Supplier TSMC Readies 3nm Chip Production for Second Half of 2022\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced last year that it would embark on a two-year-long journey to transition all of its Mac computers, both desktops, and laptops, to use its own in-house processors. Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, M1. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the four Macs with ‚ÄåM1‚Äå and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\nIntel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs. Bloomberg reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as 32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics for future Mac releases.\nTags: Intel, Apple Silicon\nThis article, \"Intel Processor Market Share May Fall to New Low Next Year Due to Apple Silicon\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to Apple's announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nBased on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says \"The Shrink Next Door\" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac \"Ike\" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin \"Marty\" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.\nOver the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.\nThe project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other ‚ÄåApple TV+‚Äå news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of \"Truth Be Told,\" an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer. The series is set to return August 20, with new episodes released every Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIn season two, investigative reporter turned true crime podcaster Poppy Parnell (played by Spencer) dives into a new case that deeply involves her childhood friend turned media mogul Micah Keith (played by Kate Hudson).\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple TV+ Shares Trailer for 'The Shrink Next Door' Comedy Series Starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today lowered the prices of AppleCare+ plans for MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models equipped with the M1 chip. Coverage offered by the plans, as well as accidental damage fees, appear to remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, AppleCare+ for the MacBook Air now costs $199, down from $249. The new price applies to both M1 and Intel-based MacBook Air models, although Apple no longer sells the Intel-based model directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has split AppleCare+ into two separate plans for the M1 and Intel-based models, with pricing for the M1 model lowered to $249, down from $269. Notably, the price of AppleCare+ for the Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pro remains $269, so customers opting for the Apple silicon model now receive a slight discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new lower prices are also available in other countries we've checked, such as Canada, with discounts varying based on the local currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomers who recently purchased AppleCare+ for one of the affected MacBook models can contact Apple Support for assistance with cancelling their current AppleCare+ plan and purchasing a new one at the lower price, according to information obtained by MacRumors, but Apple did not provide a cutoff date for eligibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppleCare+ for Mac provides up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other damage. AppleCare+ also provides 24/7 priority access to Apple's technical support representatives by online chat or phone.\nRelated Roundups: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13\"\nTag: AppleCare\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Neutral), 13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forums: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro\nThis article, \"Apple Lowers Prices of AppleCare+ Plans for M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

They‚Äôre all radical but none as\nin-your-face radical as the iOS 15 version for the iPhone, which\npulls the address bar to the bottom and hides a ton of controls\nbehind a menu-hamburger button.\nWe recorded this before today‚Äôs release of the third developer betas for iOS 15 and MacOS 12 Monterey, but it all holds up. The good news is that today‚Äôs betas show that Apple has taken criticism of the new Safari UI designs seriously‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâon MacOS, Safari once again defaults to showing the tab bar as a discrete UI element in the window, with one URL address bar. (Similar changes are coming for iPadOS, but didn‚Äôt make it for today‚Äôs beta.) The iOS changes today aren‚Äôt as significant, but, having talked to folks at Apple, there are a lot of changes and refinements still to come as summer progresses. I feel good about what I‚Äôve heard.\n(Something I missed in my critique of the Safari 15 betas two weeks ago: you can long-press on the domain name to the left of the ‚Äú¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Äù button in the floating toolbar to bring up a contextual menu. That contextual menu contains a Share item, and today‚Äôs beta 3 adds a Reload item (screenshot). I still say Share and Reload are both important enough that they should be exposed as top-level buttons, but knowing that this long-press menu exists is a great tip if you‚Äôre already using the betas.)\n¬†‚òÖ",

Rob Thomas, who has led IBM‚Äôs Watson initiative in the\npast, will become the new senior vice president of global markets.\nDid you catch this story 12 days ago? I almost didn‚Äôt. IBM is still a very big company‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ#42 on the current Fortune 500 list‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut they‚Äôre just not relevant in the way they used to be, or the way today‚Äôs big 5 tech companies are.\nIt wasn‚Äôt too long ago‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ20, 25 years?‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhen a leadership story like this at IBM would have been all anyone in tech talked about for weeks to come. They‚Äôve been diminished not because the government broke them up or curbed their behavior through regulations, but simply because they faded away. It is extremely difficult to become dominant in tech, but it‚Äôs just as difficult to stay dominant for longer than a short run.\nI don‚Äôt offer this observation as an argument against any and all regulation and antitrust investigations of big tech companies.

(Mark Gurman first wrote about this product back in February.)\nThe closest competitor is probably Anker‚Äôs $46 PowerCore Magnetic 5K. Apple‚Äôs battery pack is smaller‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâmaybe quite a bit smaller‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut Anker‚Äôs has more storage capacity. With Apple‚Äôs, you can plug your iPhone into a wall charger and it will reverse-charge the battery pack, if attached. Anker‚Äôs only charges in one direction, from the battery pack to the iPhone, but you can charge the iPhone while the battery pack is connected to a wall charger.\nApple‚Äôs battery pack works at 15W‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe full speed of MagSafe‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut only when the battery pack itself is plugged into a wall charger. When it‚Äôs in your pocket, it charges your iPhone at 5W, the same speed at which Anker‚Äôs always charges. The other notable difference is that only Apple‚Äôs battery pack shows its charge level in the iOS Battery widget.\nA bit of a shame that Apple is only selling it in white (for now?)‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâmost of their recent battery cases have been available in both black and white (and sometimes pink and Product Red).\n¬†‚òÖ",

But Rumsfeld was the chief advocate of every disaster in the years after September 11. Wherever the United States government contemplated a wrong turn, Rumsfeld was there first with his hard smile‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsquinting, mocking the cautious, shoving his country deeper into a hole. His fatal judgment was equaled only by his absolute self-assurance. He lacked the courage to doubt himself. He lacked the wisdom to change his mind.\n¬†‚òÖ",

          "description": "Mark Gurman, in the premiere edition of his newsletter for Bloomberg, Power On:\nLet‚Äôs get right to the point: I wrote this newsletter on an iPad\nPro. That might not sound like some shocking revelation, but trust\nme, I had all but relegated the tablet to video watching and light\ngaming duties. Since this month‚Äôs release of the iPadOS 15 beta,\nhowever, I‚Äôve left my laptop mostly behind and have done the vast\nmajority of my work from the iPad.\nNow I have even stronger feelings for what Apple Inc. needs to\nchange about the iPad‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it goes beyond software. It‚Äôs time\nfor a giant screen, one in the 14-inch to 16-inch range. I love\nthe speed, touchscreen, versatility and Magic Keyboard, but the\n12.9-inch display is far too small for someone accustomed to a\n16-inch MacBook Pro.\nAnd I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks that: I‚Äôm told that Apple has\nengineers and designers exploring larger iPads that could hit\nstores a couple of years down the road at the earliest. They‚Äôre\nunlikely for next year‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwith Apple‚Äôs attention on a redesigned\niPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it‚Äôs possible they\nnever come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for\nmany people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines\nbetween tablet and laptop.\nI dig the conversational tone here. Gurman is, indisputably, the best and most accurate Apple rumor reporter. But his writing feels held back by Bloomberg‚Äôs restrictive house style for reporting. With this newsletter he‚Äôs freed from all the repetitive boilerplate about ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because blah blah blah‚Äù.\nAs for bigger iPads, would a 16-inch iPad still be hand-holdable? If not, would it be in a true laptop enclosure? Or could they make it hand-holdable by making it even thinner?\n¬†‚òÖ",

          "description": "Chaim Gartenberg, writing for The Verge:\nWithin that mess of product names are two core issues: Google‚Äôs\napparent love of launching new services and its inability to\ncombine products under one umbrella.\nCompetitors like WhatsApp demonstrate what the opposite approach\ncould be: a chat service tied to a user‚Äôs phone number that allows\nfor video and voice, all from one app. Or there‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs iPhone\napproach, which ties email addresses and phone numbers to two\nservices: iMessage for text and FaceTime for audio and video.\nGoogle keeps falling into the same cycle, though, one that has\nrepeated itself throughout the years. It‚Äôll build out new\nservices, integrating them into more areas of its product lineup,\nthen try to wipe the slate clean, launch new services that\n(eventually) replace the old set, and start the cycle anew.\nEye-opening to see it all laid out on a timeline like this. My first thought was that this exemplified my argument the other day about Google‚Äôs lack of institutional focus. But it sort of works against my argument that Sundar Pichai is shepherding Google in a more focused direction‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa bunch of these false steps in messaging were under his leadership.\nIt really is quite a comparison to email, where Gmail was announced in 2004‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhile Google was still a nascent company‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand they haven‚Äôt wavered since.\n¬†‚òÖ",

It is also available from\nany other browser at search.brave.com. [‚Ä¶]\nBrave Search is different from other search engines because it\nuses its own index and follows different principles:\nPrivacy: no tracking or profiling of users.\nUser-first: the user comes first, not the advertising and data\nindustries.\nIndependence: Brave has its own search index for answering\ncommon queries privately without reliance on other providers.\nChoice: soon, options for ad-free paid search and ad-supported\nsearch.\nTransparency: no secret methods or algorithms to bias results,\nand soon, community-curated open ranking models to ensure\ndiversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright\ncensorship.\nSeamlessness: best-in-class integration between the browser and\nsearch without compromising privacy, from personalization to\ninstant results as the user types.\nOpenness: Brave Search will soon be available to power other\nsearch engines.\nI‚Äôm interested to see how it compares to DuckDuckGo (my default for several years now) in daily driving.\nRoger Montti at Search Engine Journal had good things to say about it last week:\nBrave search is currently in testing mode. So it‚Äôs not fair to\nmake judgments on an unfinished product. That said, the quality of\nthe search results that I have seen are outstanding in terms of\nusefulness. [‚Ä¶]\nThere is a lack of clutter in Brave that sets it apart not only\nfrom Google but from Bing and DuckDuckGo. After using Brave, I\nsuspect that a reason why I have not embraced Bing, despite liking\nBing‚Äôs search results, is that Bing feels similar to Google.\nBrave on the other hand offers me something different that feels\njust right and makes me want to return to it, something I‚Äôve never\nfelt using any other Google competitor.\n¬†‚òÖ",

On the Mac side, some of the new features require an\nM1 processor.\nOverall, maintaining support for old devices while restricting\ncertain new features to more capable recent models is a great\nstrategy. That way, fewer people are forced to buy new hardware\njust to participate, but the new features encourage hardware\nupgrades for those who want to take advantage of them.\nIt‚Äôs a testimony to Apple‚Äôs commitment to device longevity that iOS 15 will run on A9-based iPhones (2015‚Äôs iPhone 6S and 2016‚Äôs original iPhone SE). Of course they don‚Äôt get all the new features.

The IP and encrypted URL then\ntravels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a\n‚Äútrusted partner‚Äù. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple\nwould not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,\nbased on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on\nthe right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.\nIt‚Äôs a little weird that Apple doesn‚Äôt want to talk about who these ‚Äútrusted partners‚Äù are, because if we don‚Äôt know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them?

Grinding Gear Games will launch Path of Exile: Expedition on July 23.\nThe Expedition expansion adds a new activity where players bomb artifact sites for gear. Commissioned by the Kalguur, players will place traps along the ground to unearth loot and other artifacts. But these explosion also cause ancient Kalguur to rise from the grave and strike back. Players can also use explosives to blow through walls and find secrets, or pick up even better loot by unearthing treasure chests.\nOnce players have the artifacts, they can then haggle with the Kalguur for more loot. Players will need to balance getting a deal with not pissing of the NPC they‚Äôre trading with.\nGrinding Gear Games is also making a lot of big changes with Expedition. Players will gain access to 19 new Skill and Support Gems. This will give players more ways to build their characters, even outside of the new Expedition mode. The studio will also rework the game‚Äôs Flask system, which previously forced players to slam their fingers on keys repeatedly. Before the change, some players even created homemade devices to help press multiple keys simultaneously, the developer said.\nAll of these additions also come with a host of nerfs, which may be divisive in the community. Grinding Gear Games is starting a new initiative to make Path of Exile more difficult, and it starts with changing the game‚Äôs balance.\nFinally, the studio announced the return of Path of Exile: Royale, a battle royale mode inside the popular action game.",

Stockholm-based Fatshark said, in a familiar refrain, that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted its original plan to deliver Darktide later this year.\nMarin Wahlund, founder and CEO of Fatshark, announced the delay on social media, explaining, ‚ÄúWe have a responsibility to deliver the best game we possibly can, and frankly we need more time to accomplish this goal.

These vehicles are designed to be highly customizable, and is scheduled to be released in two waves, so players can mix and match to create the perfect ride.\nThere are also illegal elements to the new arena, of course. Getaway drivers and fearless stunt riders will be able to pick up jobs that need a good, solid wheelman. For GTA$50,000, players can sign up to become a member, which unlocks a new progression track called Reputation. Level up your Reputation, and you can get new benefits and rewards, like unique tattoos and merch.\nTen new cars will drop on July 20, with an additional seven dropping over the rest of the summer. When GTA Online launches for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, some of these vehicles will be eligible for special improvements ‚Äî only for people who are playing on those consoles, which will give them a nice edge.\nPlayers can expect more content this summer.

          "description": "Image: Concerned Ape/Shekurika\n    \n\n  \nNow you can see fish sprites below the water\n Stardew Valley is the game that just keeps on giving. Since its release in 2016, it has seen more than its fair share of generous updates. However, there‚Äôs still little things you could improve here and there. Thanks to a mod from Shekurika, one part of the game just got a little easier to play: fishing. If you use it, you‚Äôll be able to see the fish below the water. \nUsually in Stardew Valley, you cast your line onto the the blank slate of the open water. Unlike similar games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you don't see shadows of fish or even a disturbance on the surface of the water. Oftentimes, you‚Äôll have to cast your lure in a few spots before you get a bite. This mod changes the game so you‚Äôll be able see all the fish‚Äôs sprites spawn in the water. That way, you know exactly where to place your lure if you‚Äôre looking for a specific fish to flesh out your collection or complete a recipe. \nIt‚Äôs a thoughtful adjustment because fishing in Stardew can be a little bit tricky. The rod is slightly finicky, and you‚Äôll lose fish after hooking them if you aren‚Äôt careful. It‚Äôs probably one of the hardest skills to learn in the game. This mod cuts down on the grind and helps you to catch what you need, even if you aren‚Äôt the most skilled angler. \nThe mod also adds a few bonus configuration options. If you want, you can tweak how many fish spawn on the map to create more fish. Also, you can toggle an option to allow the player to see the game‚Äôs other ‚Äúfishable‚Äù items ‚Äî like a rusty spoon and spur ‚Äî as well. \nThe mod is currently published on Nexus Mods ‚Äî and due to a recent policy change on the website, this and all its other mods will be permanently stored online. So if this seems like a feature you‚Äôd like, well you have all the time in the world to grab it.",

A PlayStation blog on the game has an extended trailer as well as plenty of new gameplay details. \nThe game looks like a more introspective take on sci-fi exploration. You play as Mei, a researcher who is part of a group of aviator scientists who embark on an interstellar trip and arrive on an ocean planet. ‚ÄúWe aspired to create a video game to express our own feelings of awe when we look up at the starry sky,‚Äù the trailer says. \nThe new look showed a deeper dive into gameplay. In Jett, you‚Äôll be flying a lot; you‚Äôll pilot your spaceship in third person and weave your way through trees and obstacles. As you explore, you‚Äôll be able to leave your ship and explore the land on foot as well, in first-person view. \nThe trailer explains that the game doesn‚Äôt rely on combat or resource extraction. You‚Äôll have the opportunity to respect the indigenous wildlife of the planet. Overall, it looks like like a much more peaceful, less violent take on an exploration game ‚Äî which is a genre that has historically pushed players to harvest as much as possible from the land. \nJett: The Far Shore was originally announced in June 2020. Since then, the studio has said that the game would be delayed to 2021. It is still slated to release in 2021 for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and on PC via the Epic Games Store.",

But it seems that the map will be big enough to give players plenty of space to maneuver. There are plenty of buildings with rooftops to traverse, as well as a subway with deadly highspeed trains. It also seems like the new map will have secret areas to explore and traps to activate. There might also be an automated robot that players can activate to take some pressure off, if the zombies get a little too overwhelming.\nIn the trailer, the developer also shows off a weapon that fires several mini-rockets at a time, and a space-age pistol that seems to mow down zombies in a flash. As for enemies, there‚Äôs a skull-faced zombie that looks like it‚Äôs harnessing the power of the Dark Aether to empower other zombies around it.\nMauer Der Toten will be released on July 15 as part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War‚Äôs midseason update, which should include more changes and additions on top of the new Zombies map.",

The event, which was originally supposed to happen in Stockholm, Sweden, will now be held in Bucharest, Romania, Valve announced on Wednesday. \nValve started working with Sweden to host the 2020 tournament a year ahead of time in 2019. As the summer-set event got closer, it became clear that it would have to be put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, which pushed the tournament from 2020 to 2021 ‚Äî something many tournaments and events like the Olympics and the European Soccer Championships faced as well. After the delay, the tournament was eventually rescheduled for August 2021. \nHowever, according to a post from Valve last month, despite several assurances over the previous year, the Swedish Sports Federation voted not to accept esports into its federation and Valve‚Äôs game was denied classification as an elite sporting event, meaning that Visa applications for players outside of the European Union would not be approved. \nInstead, players‚Äô entry into the country would be subject to the approval of individual border agents. This called teams‚Äô abilities to field their full rosters into question and made it impossible to guarantee the tournament‚Äôs integrity, so on June 21, Valve chose to delay the tournament and move it to a new location. \nOn Wednesday, Valve announced that The International 10 ‚Äî Dota 2 Championships will officially be held at the Arena Nationala in Bucharest, Romania starting on Oct. 7 and concluding on Oct. 17. The tournament‚Äôs new venue can seat up to 55,000 fans normally, but it remains to be seen how Valve will set it up for The International ‚Äî though the developer did say that ticket information will be available soon.",

Blood Money starts off in the city of Saint Denis, and has players team up with an underworld power player. Unlike previous updates like the frontier roles, there is no starting cost; players can just jump into the missions without acquiring gold bars. The Blood Money update will begin on July 13.\nCowboys can embark on a new mission type called Crimes, which can be completed solo or as part of a Posse. Sometimes, you might be stopping a coach and robbing the passengers, and other missions are a multi-stage robbery with debt collecting, kidnapping, and other unsavory methods. This is all done in pursuit of a new kind of currency called Capitale, which has been stolen and distributed among the common low lives of the West. Players can earn Capitale through Crimes, or find innocent people with Capitale in free roam, at which point you can rob them and take that sweet, sweet currency.\nThe second new mission type is called Opportunities. Once a player accumulates enough Capitale, underworld contact Guido Martelli will send you out into the world to rob, undermine, and kneecap a rising politician. The first Opportunities will launch with Blood Money on July 13; more will come in future.\nBlood Money will come with a new variation on the game‚Äôs season pass called the Quick Draw Club, which divides the usual structure up into four shorter tracks. Pamphlets previously available through the season pass that offer in-game benefits will be placed on sale at the Fence, so they can be acquired much more easily. \nFinally, on July 13 both Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption 2 will offer Nvidia DLSS support for anyone on PC with eligible Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards. That‚Äôs a nice way to upgrade an already beautiful game, and re-explore the story campaign or take a look at Online‚Äôs new content.",

Titled RoboCop: Rogue City, the first-person shooter will put players in the total body prosthesis of Alex Murphy, aka RoboCop, on a mission to protect Detroit.\nBeyond that, Nacon and developer Teyon didn‚Äôt reveal much about RoboCop: Rogue City, other than that it‚Äôs destined for PC and unspecified consoles in a couple years. Rogue City will feature an original story in the franchise‚Äôs universe, Nacon said in a news release. The publisher and developer are working with studio MGM to ‚Äúdevelop an authentic RoboCop game experience that is faithful to the franchise‚Äôs DNA,‚Äù Nacon said.\nTeyon certainly has experience bringing ‚Äô80s action heroes to video games. The Polish studio is perhaps best known for its work on Terminator: Resistance, the 2019 shooter based on the Terminator franchise that wasn‚Äôt the worst thing ever, and Rambo: The Video Game, a 2014 rail shooter that was, frankly, pretty awful. A teaser trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City hints at something similarly low budget and perhaps a bit janky, but still shows promise.\nRoboCop‚Äôs had a rough go of it in the video game space. Outside of the movie-to-arcade adaptation created by Data East in 1988, Murphy‚Äôs mostly starred in mediocre console games and free-to-play mobile fare (and one Mortal Kombat game) over the past few decades. Here‚Äôs hoping that Nacon (formerly known as Bigben Interactive) and Teyon will turn things around for ol‚Äô Robo for his next adventure.\nAs for RoboCop‚Äôs next cinematic adventure, a planned direct sequel was in the works with director Neill Blomkamp, who left the project shortly after it was announced.",

On Thursday, BioWare announced a new expansion called Legacy of the Sith, which comes with tons of story and mechanical upgrades to the game. \nPlayers get to hunt down the renegade Sith Darth Malgus on the aquatic planet of Manaan. Malgus has been a threat in the game since the very beginning, and the conflict with him has been building throughout various quests and campaigns.\nAfter Star Wars: The Old Republic‚Äôs launch in 2011, the story took a diversion into exploring a third faction, the Eternal Empire. More recent expansions have returned The Old Republic to the very familiar battleground of Empire versus Republic, and the conflict will continue as the sides battle over Manaan.\n\n\nLegacy of the Sith will raise the level cap by 5, up to 80, and will also introduce a new Flash Point and Operations for players to tackle together. In addition, players can expect some big improvements to day-to-day play style. The character customization, class design, and itemization is all being streamlined and improved.\nThe most interesting addition is Combat Styles, which means ‚Äúindependently choosing a specific class story and combining it with ability sets from other related tech or Force-wielding classes.‚Äù In short, it‚Äôs less about picking one class and being restrained to specific abilities, and more about going with a tech or Force character, then mixing and matching components to build a playing style you enjoy.\nLegacy of the Sith will arrive during the holiday season in 2021, and kick off The Old Republic‚Äôs 10th anniversary event, which runs throughout 2022.",

The patch also aims to make tons of balance changes to shake up the meta-game.\nRise of the Underworlds come with three new champions: the undead pirate Pyke, time-traveler punk Ekko, and monster queen Rek‚Äôsai. These playable characters in League of Legends make for powerful cards in Legends of Runeterra, and they are often the central point of several possible deck combinations.\nThe set also comes with a new keyword: Lurk, which powers up lurker enemies.

When they‚Äôre in that position, and you attack your enemy, every Lurker ally in your deck gets +1 damage. \nImage: Riot Games\n  \nIn terms of lore, the new cards will help round out the settings of Zaun, Shurima, and Bilgewater. Supporting cards from Legends of Runeterra can end up playing important roles in the longterm story of the setting.\nLegends of Runeterra is a free-to-play game available on iOS, Android, and Windows PC.

In CSS, we get nice tools that help us create better layouts, faster.

          "description": "During a Tonight Show appearance in 1978, Johnny Carson asked Carl Sagan about the scientific accuracy of Star Wars. Sagan replied:\nThe 11-year-old in me loved them but they could have made a better effort to to do things right. A lot of different aspects of things ‚Äî Star Wars starts out saying it‚Äôs on some other galaxy and then you see there‚Äôs people. Starting in scene one there‚Äôs a problem, because human beings are the result of a unique evolutionary sequence based upon so many individually unlikely random events on the Earth.\nIn fact, I think most evolutionary biologists would agree that if you started the Earth out again and just let those random factors operate you might wind up with beings that are as smart as us and as ethical and artistic and all the rest, but they would not be human beings. That‚Äôs for the Earth. So in another planet, different environment, very unlikely to have a human being. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely that there would be creatures as similar to us as as the dominant ones in Star Wars.\nAnd a whole bunch of other things: they‚Äôre all white. The skin of all the humans in Star Wars, oddly enough, is like this. And not even the other colors represented on the Earth at present, much less greens and blues and purples and oranges.\n\n\nCarson pushes back slightly at this point: ‚ÄúThey did have the scene of Star Wars with a lot of strange characters.‚Äù But Sagan persists:\nYeah, but none of them seem to be in charge of the galaxy. Everybody in charge of the galaxy seemed to look like us. And I thought it was a large amount of human chauvinism.\n\n\nSagan also complained about Han Solo‚Äôs boast of doing the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. According to the script, this was an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù lie on Han‚Äôs part to make his ship sound impressive, so Sagan missed that. But then, post-Lucas, the Kessel Run was explained in Solo: A Star Wars Story as a distance shortcut and not an elapsed completion time, so‚Ä¶.

After closing one file and before opening another, she routinely checked her social-media feeds. Her expression, her posture, did not vary depending on the information she encountered there: a news report about a horrific natural disaster, a photograph of someone‚Äôs beloved pet, a female journalist speaking out about death threats, a recondite joke requiring familiarity with several other previous Internet jokes in order to be even vaguely comprehensible, a passionate condemnation of white supremacy, or a promoted tweet advertising a health supplement for expectant mothers. Nothing changed in her outward relationship to the world that would allow an observer to determine what she felt about what she saw. Then, after some length of time, with no apparent trigger, she closed the browser window and reopened the text editor. Occasionally one of her colleagues would interject with a work-related question and she would answer, or someone would share a funny anecdote with the office and they would all laugh, but mostly the work continued quietly.\n\n\nPer an interview with Rooney, the piece is excerpted from her next novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, due out in September and eagerly anticipated in this household.\nTags: Sally Rooney",

For his latest video, he‚Äôs collaborated with Michael Notter (visuals) and Paul O‚ÄôMara (sound) on a video called 7777 Days.\nIn a first step, Michael used the machine learning library dlib (http://dlib.net/) and some custom Python code to detected in each of Noah‚Äôs photos 5 face landmarks (i.e. both eyes, the nose and the two corners of the mouth). These landmarks were then used to align the faces in all photos, so that the eyes and corner of the mouth were horizontally oriented and always an equal distance apart. After that, some small image intensity correction were applied to make very dark images a bit brighter and very bright ones a bit darker. This was followed by an upscaling of all images (where needed) to a 4K resolution.\n\n\nThe result is a 2-minute video (reminiscent of Jason Salavon‚Äôs work) that spans half of Kalina‚Äôs life ‚Äî in the video he ages 2 months every second and 10 years a minute.\nTags: mesmerizing¬†¬† Michael Notter¬†¬† Noah Kalina¬†¬† Paul O‚ÄôMara¬†¬† photography¬†¬† video",

A first attempt to buy from Best Electronics is a sink-or-swim proposition: learn the rules, or accept your fate‚Ä¶\nKoda is a monopolist, of a sort, but he‚Äôs no Jeff Bezos. Best Electronics has no virtual shopping cart, or any other Amazon-esque conveniences. The store‚Äôs website looks the same as it has since the early 2000s: it‚Äôs a lengthy, multicoloured text scroll, as if Jack Kerouac quit the novel-writing business (but not the benzedrine) and started typing about Atari‚Ä¶ \n \n\nAnyone who can‚Äôt figure out this system risks being deemed a time-waster. In emails to customers, Koda often laments his busy schedule, and he seems to take distractions personally. He would rather lose a sale than suffer someone who hasn‚Äôt learned the rules.\n \n\nBest has been in business more than 25 years. Its equipment is mostly unused Atari originals, not salvaged parts. The company‚Äôs catalog was printed more than 20 years ago (and is available only in print); corrections (including changes in price) are only available online. His customers both love him and fear him. \nIn short, it‚Äôs a throwback to old-school nerd retail, the kind lampooned by The Simpsons‚Äô Comic Book Guy.

Our solar system, with its surprising abundance of living creatures and nonstop radiation and asteroid showers, is a placid, private garden compared to the rest of it. \nIn particular, there are perhaps trillions of rogue planets (planetary bodies ranging from little rocky Earth-sized guys to super-Jupiter gas giants) in the Milky Way, including a surprisingly large fleet of the things right near the galactic core.\nThis is unusual, since the typical way we detect exoplanets is by marking their repeated procession across a star. But rogue planets, by definition, don‚Äôt orbit stars. So the way astronomers find them is a little different, requiring use of gravitational microlensing.\nGizmodo breaks it down:\nData gathered by NASA‚Äôs now-retired Kepler Space Telescope has revealed a small population of free-floating planets near the Galactic Bulge. The new finding raises hope that a pair of upcoming missions will result in further detections of unbound planets, which drift through space separated from their home stars‚Ä¶.\nIt‚Äôs impossible to know what the conditions are like on these presumed rogue exoplanets, but [astronomer Iain] McDonald said they could be ‚Äúcold, icy wastelands,‚Äù and, if similar in size to Earth, their surfaces would ‚Äúclosely resemble bodies in the outer Solar System, like Pluto.‚Äù\nThe new paper suggests the presence of a large population of Earth-sized rogue planets in the Milky Way. It‚Äôs becoming clear that free-floating planets are common. McDonald said his team is currently working to come up with a more precise estimate for how many of them might exist.\n\n\nDid you catch that part about how McDonald‚Äôs team made this discovery using a now-retired telescope? Yeah. Apparently the new telescope projects coming online are both more powerful and (in particular) better equipped to detect gravitational lensing effects, and therefore more likely to detect rogue planets in the future. \nTags: planets¬†¬† space¬†¬† telescopes",

You can formalize the paradox via the Drake equation or some other method, but that‚Äôs the crux of it.\nWhat‚Äôs less clear is how Enrico Fermi originally phrased the paradox. At Language Log, Mark Lieberman points out that each of the participants in the original conversation remembers it differently:\nAt lunch, Fermi suddenly exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù (Teller‚Äôs remembrance), or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever wonder where everybody is?‚Äù (York‚Äôs remembrance), or ‚ÄúBut where is everybody?‚Äù (Konopinski‚Äôs remembrance).\nAs Liberman writes, ‚Äúour memory of exact word sequences usually fades more quickly than our memory of (contextually interpreted) meanings. More broadly, the exact auditory sensations normally fade very quickly; the corresponding word sequences fade a bit more slowly; and the interpreted meanings last longest.‚Äù \nMy own favorite (for purely aesthetic reasons) is ‚Äúwhere is everybody?‚Äù It just kind of says everything you want such an observation to say.\nTags: aliens¬†¬† Enrico Fermi¬†¬† language¬†¬† linguistics¬†¬† paradoxes",

But troubling safety practices persisted.\nWorse, researchers‚Äô success at uncovering new threats did not always translate into preparedness.\nEven if the coronavirus jumped from animal to human without the involvement of research activities, the groundwork for a potential disaster had been laid for years, and learning its lessons is essential to preventing others.\n\n\nIs it possible that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab? Yes. Is it probable? We can‚Äôt know that right now. It‚Äôs a tantalizing puzzle involving a possible cover-up, but irresponsibly assigning certainty to the situation does no one but attention-seeking pundits any good.\nTags: Covid-19¬†¬† medicine¬†¬† science¬†¬† Zeynep Tufekci",

Boing Boing explains:\nFrom the 1940s until the low-cost videocassette boom of the 1980s, audio filmstrips were commonly used in classrooms as an alternative to 16mm film projectors that were more expensive and fiddly to keep working.\n\n\nThis post doubles as one of those ‚Äúsay how old you are without saying how old you are‚Äù Twitter prompts. Here‚Äôs more on filmstrips from the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences:\nWhile the show was a welcome diversion from parsing, long division and dictation, what we didn‚Äôt realise was the filmstrips were an educational revolution in Australia akin to smart boards today. They were stored in neat little canisters which could be easily dispatched to schools. Accompanying them was a script read by the teacher describing the 25 or so images depicted in the films, which were manually advanced in the projector.\n\n\nUntil watching this Goodnight Moon video, I had totally forgotten about the beep used in filmstrip audio used to signal someone to switch to the next frame.\nTags: books¬†¬† Goodnight Moon¬†¬† Margaret Wise Brown¬†¬† video",

(WTF?!) Using a contemporary copy of the full scene painted by Gerrit Lundens and an AI program for getting the colors and angles right, the Rijksmuseum has ‚Äúrestored‚Äù The Night Watch, augmenting the painting with digital printouts of the missing bits. The uncropped Rembrandt is shown above and here is Lundens‚Äôs version:\n\nI‚Äôm not an expert on art, but the 1715 crop and the shift of the principal characters from right-of-center to the center appears to have radically altered the whole feel of the painting.\nWith the addition especially on the left and the bottom, an empty space is created in the painting where they march towards. When the painting was cut [the lieutenants] were in the centre, but Rembrandt intended them to be off-centre marching towards that empty space, and that is the genius that Rembrandt understands: you create movement, a dynamic of the troops marching towards the left of the painting.\n\n\n(via @john_overholt)\nTags: art¬†¬† artificial intelligence¬†¬† Gerrit Lundens¬†¬† Rembrandt",

And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called ‚Äúmama‚Äù or something like it didn‚Äôt feel like me at all. And no matter how many times or versions of ‚Äúmom‚Äù I tried, it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable. I knew being called ‚Äúmom‚Äù or ‚Äúmommy‚Äù would be easier to digest for most people. The idea of having two moms is not super novel, especially where we live. \nSo I tried other words. And when I played around with ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù it felt better. Better, but not perfect. It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in.

Unfortunately, similarly to the OHL, the WHL also had its season suspended, and as a result, Sillinger opted to play in the USHL this season instead of with the Medicine Hat Tigers (amazing team name). \nSillinger is a very interesting player for a couple of reasons. First, he is the son of former NHLer and first round pick Mike Sillinger, who played primarily with the Red Wings and Islanders, though he did have a stint as a Flyer from 1997 to 1999! Second, and more importantly, he is a consistent scorer from his center position, and can also play on the left wing. He managed 20+ goals in the WHL in 2019-20, as well as i‚Ä¶",
