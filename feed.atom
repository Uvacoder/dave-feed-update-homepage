This is the yoke and throttle that you’ve been looking for
 We’ve known that Microsoft Flight Simulator was coming to Xbox consoles for literally years now. This week at E3 Microsoft finally gave us a launch date — July 27. What remained unclear to fans, however, was how they were actually going to fly those airplanes on a console. Sure, you could use an Xbox controller, but the grass is especially green on the PC side of the fence with a boatload of boutique controllers and high-end joysticks. 
Fear not, console pilots, for Turtle Beach has come to your rescue with the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System. It’s a full-fledged yoke and throttle compatible with Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Windows 10. The announcement was made Monday in a n…]]></summary>

Capcom says DLC is now in development
 The story of Resident Evil Village will continue in a new expansion, Capcom announced Tuesday during its E3 2021 showcase. By popular demand, Capcom said, “development has just started” on additional DLC for the game. 
Unfortunately, Capcom did not provide details about its plans, but promised more info at a later date.
Resident Evil Village producer Tsuyoshi Kanda said that players will have something to look forward to next month, however. Kanda announced that Resident Evil RE: Verse, the deathmatch multiplayer mode that features heroes and bioweapons from the Resident Evil franchise, will go live in July after a brief delay.
The previous game in the franchise, Resident Evil 7 biohazard, received a number of post-release story-based add-ons, including Banned Footage Vol. 1 and 2, Not A Hero starring Chris Redfield, and End of Zoe.
Resident Evil Village was released in May for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. In our review of the first-person survival-horror game, we called Village’s blend of gunplay and scares “the perfect cocktail of horror and action.”]]></summary>

Still green, though
 Microsoft is, apparently, changing the game cases for Xbox titles. Box art seen at Best Buy and other retailers more prominently calls out the compatible platforms while eschewing the embossed Xbox logo that fronted game cases since the launch of Xbox One.
It’s a subtle change and, considering how many full copy sales of video games take place online today, one that some may not notice for a while. It also seems necessary considering Microsoft is supporting two consoles and, the Xbox Series X’s backward compatibility notwithstanding, some games are in fact Series X only.
Microsoft has long aspired to unify its video games presence under a single brand, but it still can’t quite seal the deal. Xbox games are sold on The Microsoft Store, for example, while PC subscribers peruse the Xbox Game Pass for PC library. And let us never speak of Games for Widows Live, which Microsoft needed two years to finally shut down.
Bottom line to you, the consumer: Not much, really. The design change probably means Microsoft saves a few cents stamping the Xbox logo on the top. We now return you to your regularly scheduled E3.]]></summary>

 Xbox fans wondering why Rare’s Everwild didn’t show up at Sunday’s E3 showcase now have an answer: The studio has “completely rebooted” the open-world adventure game under a new creative director, and its release is multiple years away, reports Video Games Chronicle.
Citing sources with knowledge of Everwild’s development, VGC reports that Rare has undertaken “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction” following the departure last fall of its previous creative director, Simon Woodroffe. Gregg Mayles — who has worked at Rare for more than three decades, and is the studio’s most senior employee on the creative side, according to VGC — has been tapped as creative director for the ongoing reboot, VGC repo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular iOS and Mac-based journaling app Day One has been acquired by Automattic, a company best known for running WordPress.com. News of the acquisition was announced today on the Day One blog.





The Day One app will continue to be run separately, and Day One founder Paul Mayne will continue to lead the Day One team. Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.
When a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company. That's not the case here. I'll be remaining at the helm of Day One, leading the same passionate team that has been responsible for the development and design behind the app today. This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn't going away. Instead, it'll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.
Day One's privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it's long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.



Day One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings. Day One Premium is priced at $3.99 per month and the app can be downloaded from the App Store. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some M1 iMacs appear to have a manufacturing defect that causes the display to be mounted on the stand in a way that's not perfectly aligned, leading to a crooked display.





YouTuber iPhonedo over the weekend published a review of the ‌M1‌ iMac, and he found that his machine appeared to be tilted on one side, a mounting disparity that was visibly noticeable and proved with a ruler.






Another person on the Apple Support Communities also complained of a non-level display with a 1mm disparity between the right and the left sides of the display, and there was a third complaint on Reddit, with the person in that situation discovering the issue after watching iPhonedo's video.
Checked mine after watching this and it's also crooked.

The Flyers lock up some forward depth in the system.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are getting some offseason business out of the way before the Stanley Cup is handed out. 
Announced on Monday, the team has re-signed forwards German Rubtsov and Linus Sandin to one-year, two-way deals that will carry a league-minimum $750,000 cap hit if they are on the NHL roster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad, known for its range of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the Card for AirTag, which is designed to make it easier for an AirTag to fit inside a wallet for tracking purposes.





With Card for AirTag, an AirTag fits inside the middle of a card-shaped holder that's then meant to fit inside of a wallet. According to Nomad, the design offers a smooth, uniform shape that allows the AirTag to be kept in the wallet without having a circular bump.



The Card for AirTag is made from a polycarbonate material with a soft-touch TPU surface, and the AirTag is designed to snap into the middle.





It's worth noting that the AirTag is quite thick on its own and not really designed for use within wallets, so this Card for AirTag is still going to take up a lot of space. Thin wallets may not accommodate the thickness of the AirTag and the accompanying Card accessory.



The Card for AirTag is priced at $20, but there's a $5 discount when bundled with one of Nomad's wallets. Nomad is also today releasing new Bi-Fold and Card wallets priced starting at $69.95. The Card for AirTag and the new wallets can be purchased from the Nomad website.

According to the new  roadmap, season 4 will have a new round-based Zombies map, new weapons, new maps, and another update to Verdansk — just not quite as big as the last one. 
The new addition to Verdansk will be a new location centered around a crashed satellite — the focus of the season’s reveal trailer, which debuted during Summer Games Fest last week. It seems that the crash will take out some existing structures, but is also big enough for players to fight in and around. Meanwhile, Verdansk’s season 3 Reloaded addition of the Nak…]]></summary>

Jack wants chaos? Jack gets chaos
 Square Enix revealed a new spinoff Final Fantasy game at its E3 2021 press conference on Sunday, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin. And while a new Final Fantasy game might sound like exciting news at a conference thin with announcements, fans were quick to notice a fatal flaw with its protagonist, Jack. 
He wears a T-shirt.  
He dons a simple, black, short-sleeved shirt with buttons on the front. If it weren’t for the ragged hem hanging down over his crotch and butt, it looks like something you could buy from the men’s section at Target. It might sound like a small thing, but this is the world of Final Fantasy, where everybody and their mom usually has an ornate, whimsical character designs. And Jack is the protagonist…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the New Yorker, Hannah Fry wrote a brief history of information visualization, a quiet innovation that has changed the world:
Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, “only a graph speaks directly to the eyes.” Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them — and the stakes dependent on those differences — became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, “If the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.”
Van Langren’s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study “Visual Explanations” (1997), “Maps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.” Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error — how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.


Van Langren’s graph, which Fry says “might be the first statistical graph in history”, is pictured at the top of this post.

PlatinumGames’ latest looks a little rough around the edges, but there’s hope
 On Sunday, Square Enix showed off new gameplay from Babylon’s Fall, the PlatinumGames-developed hack-and-slash that was first announced way back in 2018. It looked drastically different from the early gameplay preview we saw in late 2019, which made Babylon’s Fall look like a fairly traditional PlatinumGames release.
It also, frankly, looked a little ... off. What I (and others) perceived as heavily compressed streaming video artifacts obscuring the game’s graphics is actually Babylon’s Fall’s intentional art style. PlatinumGames says it’s going for a “visual style is based on classical European oil paintings” that it calls “brushwork style.” To wit, taking a closer look at direct-feed screenshots of Babylon’s Fall reveals that the graphics are being treated with a canvas-like texture and what appear to be actual brushstrokes.
“Our goal was to create a deeply layered, high quality fantasy world rendered in the oil painting style seen in classic sword and sorcery fantasy works,” said Babylon’s Fall game director Kenji Saito in a behind-the-scenes look at development.


PlatinumGames and Square Enix tapped artist Kouji Tajima to create the game’s high-fantasy art style. Tajima’s previous work is mostly in live-action film, he says, working on movies like Terminator: Dark Fate, Venom, Blade Runner 2049, and the Fantastic Beasts series.
The most encouraging bit of news on Babylon’s Fall is who’s overseeing it, the aforementioned game director Kenji Saito. He directed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Transformers Devastation, two of Platinum’s better games. He’s joined by Isao Negishi, lead game designer on Babylon’s Fall, who had the same credit on Nier: Automata.
Babylon’s Fall is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam. Square Enix has not announced a release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released new iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 updates, with the new software aimed at older devices that are unable to run the iOS 14 update that's available on modern devices.





The iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 updates can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings > General > Software Update.



According to Apple's release notes, iOS 12.5.4 introduces important security updates and is recommended for all users. Apple often releases security updates for older devices that are no longer able to get the current version of iOS in order to keep users protected from malware and other security vulnerabilities.



Apple's security support document says that the update addresses three vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Two of them that affected WebKit may have been actively exploited. One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.

Halo multiplayer is all about hunting for power weapons
 Players got some new details around Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer during 343 Industries and Microsoft’s Halo multiplayer livestream on Monday. The livestream showed off a little more than 10 minutes of new gameplay and developer interviews. It gave 343 Industries an opportunity to deliver its philosophy for Halo Infinite's multiplayer: old school.
Early in the stream, 343 Industries developers made it clear that players will start on equal footing with “fair and balanced starts,” and that they wanted to go back to the old-school Halo style of hunting for power weapons once you spawn. However, it’s not currently clear if Halo Infinite will have loadouts.

 343 Industries is totally reshaping Halo’s multiplayer customization in Halo Infinite by adding a few hallmarks of popular free-to-play games. The studio released a multiplayer overview on Monday, where it revealed what players could expect for all the game’s cosmetics when it comes out later this year. 
Because Infinite is the first Halo game to feature free-to-play multiplayer, it’s no surprise that the team at 343 is ramping up cosmetics and customization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Cold War, the Soviet Union controlled the music recording industry and even restricted the types of music that were allowed to be played & listened to. Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock & roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:
X-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl — some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand — and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.


And from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:
Before the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‘n’ roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.
“Usually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,” says Sergei Khrushchev. “Before the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.”
“They would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,” says author Anya von Bremzen. “You’d have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha’s brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.”


To learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates’ book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records — here’s Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:

The Studio Buds are the first Beats-branded earbuds to truly compete with AirPods thanks to their wire-free design that fits comfortably in the ear without the over-ear hook seen on Powerbeats Pro.






In many respects, the Studio Buds are competitive with AirPods Pro at a lower price point, with a diminutive design that's slightly lighter than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ while still offering features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency modes.

Spatial Audio, based on Dolby Atmos, is an immersive surround sound audio format that enables musicians to mix music so it sounds like the instruments are all around you in space. Thousands of Apple Music songs are available in Spatial Audio as of last week, such as Lady Gaga's "Rain on Me" and Kanye West's "Black Skinhead."



Spatial Audio is available to all Apple Music subscribers at no additional cost. The streaming music service costs $9.99 per month for individuals, $4.99 per month for students, and $14.99 per month for families of up to six people.

This is a pivotal offseason for Chuck Fletcher with the Flyers’ veteran core and underperforming youngsters at a crossroads.
 When you look at the Philadelphia Flyers roster, it’s split into a few different groups. 
There is the veteran core made up of a few guys that have been here for years (Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek, Sean Couturier) plus the recent additions (Kevin Hayes, James van Riemsdyk).  All five of those players are 28 years old (or older) with varying contract statuses. The two most valuable Flyers forwards in that group — Giroux and Couturier —have their contracts expire after next season, while the other three are under contract through 2023 (JVR), 2024 (Voracek), and 2026 (Hayes).
This is the veteran core that could be s…]]></summary>

Apple shared a teaser trailer for the second season on YouTube:






Starring and executive produced by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, "The Morning Show" unveils the power dynamics in the workplace between women and men, and women and women, in a morning talk show environment. Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, the star-studded returning cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, and others.



Apple's announcement sets the stage for what to expect in season two:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds "The Morning Show" team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley's (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.
Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial available. An extended one-year free trial is also available with the purchase of most new Apple devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the Photos app, such as the ability to see the EXIF data for a photo. The latter feature is accessed via a new "Info" button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.





In addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn't take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the HomePod image was saved from the web via Safari. 



This metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the "Saved from" location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don't have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll. 



The new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you've saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.



‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.

As of Monday morning, the delivery option for the full-sized ‌HomePod‌ on Apple's online store is listed as "sold out" in both black and white. 





Up until recently, the black model was sold out in the U.S. but the white color was available for delivery "while stocks last." That's currently no longer the case, and though Apple's white ‌HomePod‌ listing still allows customers to check availability for in-store purchase and pickup, the speaker has been unavailable in nearly all retail locations since the beginning of June.

Studio Fizbin’s thoughtful puzzle-platformer got a surprise release on Sunday
 You’ve heard this story before. Though the details may be different, the thrust of the story is the same. When the world goes to shit, there’s only one person who can save us — the chosen one, through their sheer power of chosen-ness, must set off on a calamitous journey to stop whatever terrible thing is threatening the world. 
It’s Link in the Legend of Zelda, Master Chief in Halo, Kratos in God of War. These sorts of heroes also appear in smaller-scale stories, in more intimate worlds, like the player-character in Cozy Grove, perpetually taking on everyone else’s needs. But being a hero can be isolating, even traumatic.

Coming to PC and consoles in 2022
 PC gamers itching for a Pikmin-like fix have Tinykin to look forward to in 2022. The game, from developer Splashteam, stars a tiny protagonist and a small army of helpful insects — the titular Tinykin — was revealed Sunday during the PC Gaming Show.
Here’s the narrative setup for Tinykin:
It’s the year 2748 and Milo has re-discovered Earth! He’d go down in history for this achievement, but when he lands on the planet he encounters a problem... He’s as small as a penny. And everybody’s gone. And it’s the ’90s.

As Milo, players will explore a giant house, using Tinykin to maneuver through an oversized world by building ladders, bridges, carrying objects, and more. Milo can also jump, skate, and grind, as you can see in the game’s debut trailer above.
Tinykin is coming to Windows PC and unannounced consoles next year. Developer Splashteam is composed of ex-Ubisoft developers who have worked on the Rayman and Rabbids franchises.]]></summary>

The game won’t be free-to-play after all
 Icarus, the next game from DayZ creator Dean Hall’s Rocketwerkz studio, launches on Steam Aug. 11. In a surprise announcement, the session-based multiplayer survival game will not be free-to-play. Instead the game will cost $29.99, and will be released in chapters. The announcement was made Sunday during the PC Gaming Show presentation, and was accompanied by a new trailer.
“We didn’t want the business model to get in the way of the game experience,” Hall said in a news release. “We also heard loud and clear from our community that they wanted to avoid the pitfalls of free-to-play. We want Icarus to continually evolve as a living game, always adding new session challenges and game modes. We think regular chapters and content updates are a great way to deliver.” 
Icarus puts players in the role of pioneering explorers trying to tame a wild, alien world. The session-based gameplay puts a time limit on each mission, challenging players to gather resources before their ship back to orbit leaves them behind. You can read more, including an interview with Dean Hall, in our hands-on preview. 
A deluxe edition, which will include two follow-on chapters of downloadable content, will also be available for $99.95.]]></summary>

It will be published by Frontier Foundry, the new publishing arm of Frontier Developments (Elite Dangerous, Jurassic World Evolution).

Players should expect a “meditative side scrolling” game with a “haunting soundtrack,” according to a news release.

Not much! But Todd Howard and friends want you to dig
 Starfield is the next large-scale, AAA role-playing game from Fallout and Skyrim makers Bethesda Game Studios. It will launch Nov. 11, 2022. The spacefaring RPG, first teased in 2018, is Bethesda’s biggest all-new video game world in the past 25 years. Here’s what we know about it, so far.
WHAT IS STARFIELD?
“Skyrim in space,” Todd Howard told The Washington Post. Howard is the executive producer for Bethesda Game Studios and the creative leader of its Elder Scrolls franchise since 2000. In other words, this is the full-featured Bethesda Game Studios RPG experience, seen in games like The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and Fallout 5, just applied to an all-new, science fiction setting.

Square Enix is going full character action with a new Final Fantasy spinoff
 Ninja Gaiden and Nioh developer Team Ninja is making a new Final Fantasy spinoff game for Square Enix. Titled Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin and pitched as “a bold new vision for Final Fantasy,” the game is scheduled to launch in 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is being developed by Final Fantasy veterans Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima in conjunction with Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo Games.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin appears heavy on action. In the game’s E3 2021 reveal trailer, we see a trio of Warriors of Light battling a variety of creatures and enemies, and, ultimately, the evil knight Garland from the original Final Fantasy. Square Enix’s official description of the game reads: “Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine. Yet doubts remain—are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?”
A trial version of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is available now from the PlayStation Store. It will be available on PlayStation 5 through June 24.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.]]></summary>

From Deck Nine, True Colors is out in September
 Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine revealed more information about the game’s empathy mechanic in a presentation during publisher Square Enix’s E3 presentation Sunday. The next Life is Strange game, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 10, is about a 21-year-old Asian American woman named Alex Chen who moves to Colorado to reunite with her brother Gabe. When her brother mysteriously dies, Alex uses her supernatural power, Empathy, to find out what happened in the quiet mountain town.
The clip shows that Alex has long struggled with these powers; she calls them a curse rather than a gift, oftentimes becoming overwhelmed by others’ feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. Over the course of t…]]></summary>

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The trailer page says War for Wakanda will launch in August of this year.]]></summary>

Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed iOS 15, which is available now in beta for developers ahead of a public release later this year. One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.



MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:

Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally 🎉 #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq
— Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021
 
Cross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.



From the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:
Drag and drop

With support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.
To drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.



In many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that's dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.



The first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.

 Publisher Devolver Digital brings its singular brand of video game publisher zaniness to E3 2021 (or at least close to it) with a new livestream on Saturday, June 12. Dubbed the Devolver MaxPass+ stream, the event promises new looks at upcoming games, including gameplay for Shadow Warrior 3 and Death’s Door.

New Avatar game set for 2022 release
 Ubisoft has unveiled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a first-person action-adventure game set in James Cameron’s Avatar universe. A new trailer highlighted the game’s central conflict, focusing on air-to-air combat between humans and the Na’vi.
First announced in February 2017, we now know the game has been built on Ubisoft’s proprietary Snowdrop Engine — the same technology that underpins The Division. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, in partnership with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney itself.
“In this new, standalone story,” Ubisoft says in the game’s description, “play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back on the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.”

The Siege of Paris follows Wrath of the Druids
 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s developers have post-launch support planned “well into” the game’s second year. Highlights, announced during the Ubisoft Forward livestream on Saturday, include a story expansion called The Siege of Paris, and an educational Discovery Tour mode similar to the ones made for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey.
Ubisoft did not give a specific launch date for The Siege of Paris, other than to say it would arrive this summer. The game’s first premium expansion, The Wrath of the Druids, just launched in May. That chapter took place in Ireland; this one takes players to France for “the most ambitious battle in Viking history,” Ubisoft’s Karen Lee told viewers. 
The Siege of Paris is premium content, and will be available a la carte or with the game’s Season Pass. The new chapter also brings back “black box” missions, in which the player is given only a single infiltration objective. How they complete the task is entirely up to them.
The Viking Age Discovery Tour, like its two predecessors, will be a free update to all with the game. It’s a combat-free exploration mode and, like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s tour, it will allow users to create and pursue role-playing missions for the world’s inhabitants.
Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla launched in November on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna services.]]></summary>

On June 30, Ubisoft will add cross-play and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege between all of its various PC platforms including standard PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna. Players from all three platforms will be able to queue into games together. For consoles, cross-play will be released in early 2022, when players on PlayStation and Xbox will be able to jump into games together. It does not appear that Ubisoft will let PC and console players compete together, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise.

According to Ubisoft’s announcement, these updates will also include cross-progression across “all platforms” as part of one unified account, so you can earn rewards no matter where you’re playing. 


Right after the announcement of cross-play and cross-progression, Ubisoft also gave fans a new look at the game’s newest Defensive Operator, Thunderbird. The Thunderbird preview came in the form of an gorgeous animated trailer where the new Operator takes on a bear with a flare gun and lives to tell the tale. 
Thunderbird will be available as part of Siege’s North Star update and event, which starts next week on June 14.]]></summary>

Ubisoft announces Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph as playable characters
 Far Cry 6’s season pass will add three villains from previous Far Cry games as playable characters, Ubisoft announced at its E3 2021 press conference Saturday. As seen in the trailer above, Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3, Pagan Min from Far Cry 4, and Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5 will be playable characters in post-release content for Far Cry 6.
The content appears dreamlike or hallucinogenic in nature, giving Ubisoft a narrative out for its Far Cry 6 DLC. Not that it’s ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5’s post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.
The season pass content also includes Far Cry 3’s DLC Blood Dragon.
The revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, “Vaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me. I still get recognized as Vaas, and I still feel the outpouring of love for that character - makes me very happy. Who knows... maybe I will reprise the role very soon?”
Far Cry 6, by Ubisoft Toronto, launches Oct. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna platforms. The game stars Giancarlo Esposito as the primary antagonist; he is El Presidente, Anton Castillo, the autocratic ruler determined to crush an uprising bent on regime change. Our preview from two weeks ago has more.
Update: This story has been updated with confirmation from Ubisoft.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Platforms State of the Union at WWDC this week, Apple unveiled a new API for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 that enables developers to implement an on-screen virtual game controller in their iPhone and iPad games with just a few lines of code.





While many iPhone and iPad games already offer on-screen controls, Apple's new virtual game controller is available to all developers, easy to add, and can be customized on a per-game basis. Apple said the on-screen controller can be adjusted to a variety of layouts, with up to four buttons and a thumbstick, d-pad, or touchpad available per left and right side.



"These new on-screen controls for iPhone and iPad look amazing, and they're carefully tuned for grip locations across hand sizes and for a great responsiveness and feel," said Nat Brown, an Apple engineer working on Game Technologies.



Apple offers a WWDC session and developer documentation with more details.

Season Pass owners can add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec cells
 Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline, the story expansion for those who bought the game’s premium season pass, will launch July 6, Ubisoft said on Saturday. The story brings back Aiden Pearce from the first Watch Dogs and Wrench from the second as playable characters.
Pearce, according to Ubisoft’s news release, has come to London to reconnect with his nephew, Jackson. He’s supposed to infiltrate a Broca Tech lab and steal some cutting edge technology — but Wrench gets the device first and flees. With his job botched, Pearce and his nephew are now on the lam from those who hired him.
Ubisoft’s statement says Bloodline is a prequel to the main campaign of Watch Dogs: Legion. It will also offer several side quests for both characters to complete.
Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline is available a la carte for $14.99 to those without the Season Pass. The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn’t get it with one of two premium editions in the game’s October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.
Watch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon’s Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.
Post-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.]]></summary>

Tactical alien action with Rainbow Six operators
 Rainbow Six is getting back to its tactical co-op roots, sort of. The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game’s latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation. 
The trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. 


Rainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege’s Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies — instead of the series’ usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020’s pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. 
Just like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series’ tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down — or escape from — infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege — including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  
Rainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.]]></summary>

Gearbox has Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands movie, and more in store
 Borderlands developer Gearbox Software is heading to E3 2021 armed with a new game, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands — the high-fantasy spinoff of its shooter-looter series — and a new movie. Gearbox fans expect to hear more about Borderlands — the Eli Roth-directed movie starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Jamie Lee Curtis — during its E3 Showcase on Saturday.
Gearbox Entertainment will take over the official E3 2021 livestream on Saturday, June 12 at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT. The event, which is expected to run about 30 minutes, will stream on E3’s YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter channels.
Beyond Wonderlands and Borderlands, don’t be surprised if a few Gearbox Publishing titles also get some attention during Gearbox’s E3 showcase. Norsfell and Gearbox announced earlier this week that co-op action survival RPG Tribes of Midgard will launch July 27 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam.

Registration for PC beta begins today
 Ubisoft’s 10-year-old Rocksmith franchise will become an “interactive music learning subscription service,” with its next entry, Rocksmith Plus. That’s according to an email that guitar maker Gibson let slip before Ubisoft could announce the video game at its E3 keynote on Saturday.
Per the marketing email, Ubisoft is apparently partnering with Gibson again, as the company’s Epiphone, Kramer, and Gibson models of acoustic, electric, or bass guitars are specifically mentioned as compatible. A closed beta on PC will also begin soon, with registration open today.

      A gif included with the email Gibson sent today.
  
Newcomers and returning musicians will find “an expansive library” of songs in Rocksmith Plus’s catalog. The program’s Riff Repeater, which can control a song’s speed to help players practice, also returns.
The first Rocksmith launched in 2011 but only for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That was followed two years later by Rocksmith 2014, considered a replacement rather than a sequel. That game launched for PC platforms in addition to the two consoles, and their successors.
Rocksmith 2014’s song library included 66 playable tracks on the disc, with more available as downloadable content. Saturday’s email did not specify how many songs would be available with the base game, or how deep the subscription service runs, or its pricing, for that matter.
Update: Ubisoft formally announced Rocksmith Plus at Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward event. The game still does not have a release date. During a presentation, Ubisoft said Rocksmith Plus players will also be able to use something called Rocksmith Workshop to create and add their own guitar arrangements to the game.]]></summary>

In the ad, which features the main character using an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil, multiple users can be seen struggling with their old PCs indoors while hoping that they can someday use an ‌iPad Pro‌ instead. The lyrics and soundtrack of the ad are completely based around The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World," but the visuals tell the majority of the story.



In one scene, an office employee using an old Windows PC can be seen looking out at a girl using an ‌iPad Pro‌ with the Magic Keyboard in a park while singing "up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun." The ad ends with all the characters singing "wish I could be, part of that world," referencing the world of using an ‌iPad Pro‌. 



The ad, uploaded on June 4, is currently unlisted on YouTube, meaning only those with a link will be able to watch it. It's unclear why Apple has decided not to make it public or if it plans to in the near future.

The sport is only two weeks old, but it already has hustlers and sandbaggers
 Barely two weeks into its launch and Knockout City already has hustlers.
Karthik Bala, co-founder of the studio that developed the multiplayer shooter-like dodgeball title for Electronic Arts, said he’s run into them himself. “They were messing with me,” he laughed. “They come in, they look like one of the default [skins] on startup, they play poorly, they’re uncoordinated as a team, they’re purposefully not on a crew together.”
After stumbling to a 7-to-1 deficit early in Team KO, then they poured it on. “I’m like, ‘I’ve got this game lit,’” Bala chortled. “And then all of a sudden it just flipped; and they do the ‘woo-hoo!’ and the taunts. And I’m like, what just ha…]]></summary>

In System Preferences, there's a new "Passwords" section that houses all of your ‌iCloud‌ Keychain logins and passwords so they're easier to get to, edit, and manage.

Halo, Starfield, Fable, and Game Pass news
 Microsoft’s E3 2021 press conference — called the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase — has a lot of ground to cover on June 13. The company has more to reveal for long-delayed Halo Infinite, including hopefully a finalized release date. It will also likely have updates to the Fable and Forza franchises, and Rare will likely have updates to Sea of Thieves and hopefully more to say on its mystical title Everwild. 
The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will stream on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and last for about 90 minutes. 
This is the first E3 since Microsoft acquired Bethesda, so the publisher and its studios will also take part in the press conference. Expect updates on long-awaited Starfield, and maybe a better look at The Elder Scrolls 6. Bethesda also promised updates to Fallout 76. 
Ahead of E3, Microsoft revealed plans to bring Xbox Game Pass and streaming games to internet-capable TVs and other stand-alone platforms, as well as bringing cloud based gaming to iOS devices. Microsoft also committed to bring at least one new first-party Xbox Game Studios game to Game Pass every quarter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.





In line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with "dramatically improved" speakers.



According to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.





The report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.



Prosser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.

These measures are the culmination of a 16-month antitrust investigation into tech companies practices that kicked off in 2019, and which saw Apple CEO Tim Cook testify in an antitrust hearing alongside Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.



At the conclusion of that hearing, which took place in July 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee leading the inquiry released a 450 page report with recommendations that have turned into the new antitrust bills that were proposed today.

Apple told Engadget the feature will work with stereo, 5.1, 7.1
and Dolby Atmos content. Whether you’re using a pair of AirPods
Pro or AirPods Max, the software that powers the feature will
widen the soundstage so that it seems like the entire room you’re
in is being filled with sound. When you sit down to watch a movie
or TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after
it detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while.
Once you get up to walk around, it will reactivate. Connecting
your AirPods to an Apple TV is also easy in this context. When
you’re near the device with your headphones, it will display a
popup that will allow you to quickly connect, and you won’t need
to dig into the settings menu.

Kena blends multiple genres into something new
 Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the first game from new studio Ember Lab. Its first trailer made it look like a cute romp through a forest overtaken by darkness, but after spending over an hour with a hands-on demo of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, I’ve learned it’s surprisingly difficult. Kena may look like the latest from Pixar, but the final mini-boss I encountered kicked my ass up, down, and sideways.
Kena: Bridge of Spirits has layers to it — some cute, others tough — and it made for a fun preview full of surprises.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of its annual survey given to developers at the end of WWDC, Apple is asking community members whether, following two years of the conference behind held in a digital format, they would be open to attending an in-person conference.

Due to the global health crisis, Apple has held its typically in-person Worldwide Developers Conference in an all-digital format for the past two years. The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.



Unlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. 



One of the questions as part of this year's end of WWDC survey reads, "How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?" 



While not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community's outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple is contemplating the idea, and does plan to hold its first in-person event since the global health crisis began in the coming months.

This week you can pick up three weapons and an armor piece
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week.
Map: The Burnout
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock)
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. 
Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

I am Magneto, and I would like to register a complaint. Frankly,

speech about how they were the next stage in evolution, but once I
said the word “evolution,” they looked at me doubtfully. Then I
asked them to show off their abilities, and — I hate to say this
but, have you ever been at a friend’s amateur magic show, where
the magic show is not going quite as was hoped, and there’s a lot
of saying “hold on” and “wait, hang on” and “sorry” as they fail
several times running to identify your card, and then a dead bird

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of neglect, Adobe is removing its free "Photoshop Mix" and "Photoshop Fix" apps from the App Store on June 21, 2021.





Adobe made the announcement in an update to its FAQ page for each of the apps. On the pages, Adobe says that both apps will be removed from the App Store on June 21, and advises users who used the apps to switch to using its "Photoshop Express Photo Editor," which requires either a monthly or yearly subscription for deeper photo editing.



Photoshop Mix was released on the App Store prior to when a fully-fledged version of Photoshop arrived on the iPad. It was Adobe's attempt to offer iPad users at the time some level of photo editing capabilities on the go. The app allows users to add text layers and "easily create and share professional multilayered images and designs in minutes." Photoshop Fix, on the other hand, is more tailored towards light touch-ups and refinements.



Photoshop Mix was last updated three years ago, while Photoshop Fix was updated two years with support for the iPhone X and newer screen ratio. Both apps will remain available for download on the App Store until June 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times:
As the Justice Department investigated who was behind leaks of
classified information early in the Trump administration, it took
a highly unusual step: Prosecutors subpoenaed Apple for data from
the accounts of at least two Democrats on the House Intelligence
Committee, aides and family members. One was a minor.
All told, the records of at least a dozen people tied to the
committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018, including those of
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, then the panel’s top
Democrat and now its chairman, according to committee officials
and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric
Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he
had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed. […]
Moreover, just as it did in investigating news organizations,
the Justice Department secured a gag order on Apple that expired
this year, according to a person familiar with the inquiry, so
lawmakers did not know they were being investigated until Apple
informed them last month.
Adam Schiff:
Trump repeatedly demanded the DOJ go after his political enemies.
It’s clear his demands didn’t fall on deaf ears.
This baseless investigation, while now closed, is yet another
example of Trump’s corrupt weaponization of justice.
And how much he imperiled our democracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has been working on an Apple Store at the iconic Tower Theatre in Los Angeles for years now, and the new location is set to open later this month on June 24.





Apple Tower Theatre is the first retail store in downtown Los Angeles, and it's located in L.A.'s historic Broadway Theater District. This location was the city's retail hub for the first half of the twentieth century, and is now home to a dozen theater locations.



From the beginning, Apple has envisioned the Tower Theatre store as one of the world's most prominent Apple retail locations, and Apple has been overhauling the interior of the building to turn it into retail space and an active community area. Apple shared a rendering of what Tower Theatre might look like back in 2018.

Another Eklund to the Flyers?
 William Eklund is clearly head and shoulders above the other first round European prospects.
Playing in the SHL full time this past season (he played 20 SHL games in 2019-20), Eklund outpaced 2020 first round picks Alexander Holtz (who is also his teammate, and in fact, linemate) and Lucas Raymond, and delivered a solid postseason performance. Many consider Eklund to be the most skilled forward in terms of raw ability in the draft, and given my personal propensity to favor European prospects from men’s leagues, I would have to agree.

Ceramics will have their revenge
 FromSoftware’s Elden Ring finally came out of hiding on Thursday, after two years of deafening silence about the new adventure from Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin. It looked spectacular, in a next-gen Dark Souls kind of way, with its gigantic lightning-chucking dragons, double-jumping horses, a spider made of fingers, a brand-new Tall Lady to obsess over, and, of course, those pots.
Oh, those pots.
Elden Ring’s first gameplay trailer barely hinted at the existence of anthropomorphic pots, but they’ve becoming a quiet sensation since they were revealed. It seems everyone — there are dozens of us! — loves the little pot with arms and legs, and the slightly larger pot with arms and legs. In case you blacked …]]></summary>

One team’s questionable player is another team’s gold?
 The Flyers are in a precarious position heading into the offseason. As a team in need of significant changes while working with limited cap space, producing trades, handling free agency, and running the expansion draft in a way that will regain the confidence of the less than magnanimous fanbase won’t be easy. The aforementioned salary squeeze will make adding multiple no-brainer plugs for the gaps on this roster nearly impossible, so Chucky Two-Trades would be wise to pursue players that are underrated by the rest of the league. Whether that be to simply restructure the team’s salary or to provide cheap depth that’ll free up room to add a star is up to him.
With that in mind, below are som…]]></summary>

Security breach was reportedly performed via EA’s Slack
 A group of hackers has said they’ve broken into The Sims 4 and FIFA publisher Electronic Arts’ internal systems, according to a report from Vice. Hackers reportedly stole FIFA 21 source code — for the game and its matchmaking components — as well as source code for EA’s Frostbite engine.
A total of 780 GB of data stolen was stolen, Vice reported, including “proprietary EA frameworks and software development kits.” Hackers provided Vice with documents reportedly stolen in the hack, with information on PlayStation VR and other development tools.
“We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,” an EA representative told Vice. “No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident, we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation.”
Hackers reportedly accessed EA’s internal systems through workplace chat platform Slack, which plenty of companies use for online communication. The hackers told Vice they obtained access to an EA Slack channel using “stolen cookies” sold online for $10. (Cookies can be used to access login details.)
The hackers said they contacted an EA IT support person via Slack for a “multifactor authentication token” — claiming they’d lost their phone — to login to EA’s network. The hackers provided Vice with screenshots of the steps taken in accessing the information; Vice later confirmed the details of the hack with EA.
Contents of the hack have not been released online, at least just yet. Vice reported that the hackers are looking to sell the data.
EA has not responded to Polygon’s request for more information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple revealed that newer Macs will be gaining support for Adaptive-Sync external displays with variable refresh rates in macOS Monterey.





Apple says Adaptive-Sync displays will be supported on any Mac with Apple silicon, like the M1 chip, as well as "many" recent Intel-based Macs. When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences > Displays.



Adaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.



Macs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.

How the 21-year-old forward rose above expectations in a year of disappointments for the Flyers.
 After spending most of his draft plus two season playing in the NHL during the 2019-20 campaign, Joel Farabee broke out in a big way offensively for the Flyers in his 2021 sophomore campaign. To put it simply, Farabee was one of the best goal scorers in the NHL this season, and he just turned 21 at the end of February. 
Farabee led the Flyers in goal-scoring with 20, tying him for 30th league wide, equal to players like Nathan MacKinnon and David Pastrnak. Even more impressive is that 16 of those goals occurred at even strength, tying him for 6th in the league with Alex DeBrincat, Brad Marchand, Kirill Kaprizov, and Kyle Connor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Tech Support series, Wired had Yo-Yo Ma answer some questions about the cello and music sent in by Twitter users. What I like about this is that no critic or professional interviewer would ask these questions (they are “bad” interview questions) and yet Ma answers them all generously and thoughtfully. It reminds me a little bit of when Vogue trained an AI program to interview Billie Eilish:
What I really loved hearing Billie say was that human interviewers often ask the same questions over and over, and she appreciated that the AI questions don’t have an agenda in the same way, they’re not trying to get anything from her.


Perhaps with interesting subjects who are game, having “good” interview questions maybe isn’t that important, particularly if they are repeated queried about the same topics in every interview.

Koch Media unveils new publishing label
 The next Payday game from Starbreeze Studios and a brand-new Painkiller are coming from a newly announced game publishing label called Prime Matter. Koch Media, which also owns publishing labels Deep Silver, Milestone, and Ravenscourt, announced Prime Matter on Thursday, revealing its first slate of games.
Koch Media calls Prime Matter a “premium label” that’s “dedicated to delivering brilliant immersive games.” That includes soon-to-be-released titles like Encased from Dark Crystal Games and King’s Bounty 2 by 1C Entertainment, both of which are due in the coming months. Then there are games that won’t be out for years, including Payday 3 and a new Painkiller game from Saber Interactive. 
In between, Prime Matter will publish Crossfire: Legion, a new real-time strategy game from Blackbird Interactive based on Smilegate’s Crossfire shooter series; GunGrave GORE, developer Iggymob’s anime-inspired third-person action shooter; and Kingdom Come Deliverance for Nintendo Switch. 
Prime Matter will also publish dark sci-fi action adventure Scars Above, futuristic FPS Codename Final Form, Lovecraftian horror action RPG Dolmen, Middle Ages-era action RPG The Last Oricru, story-driven fantasy adventure Echoes Of The End, and psychedelic horror adventure The Chant.

Foremost is a new, compact tab bar that floats at the bottom of the screen when you're not inputting a URL address.

Let's take a closer look at how it all fits together.





The Start Page


First seen in macOS Big Sur, Safari's redesigned Start Page is where your Bookmarks, Favorites, Frequently Visited sites, Siri Suggestions, iCloud Tabs, Reading List, and Privacy Report all live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, Apple is expanding the features built into the stock Reminders app, which received a major overhaul in 2019. With the new updates shipping this fall, users will be able to create "Smart Lists" that corral reminders based on different filters, such as their location, due date, flag, priority, and more.





With the new functionality, users can create powerful lists that show reminders based only on several filters. For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.



For date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location. Users can also select the flag filter to show only flagged reminders and the priority filter.



‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and ‌macOS Monterey‌ are all currently in beta testing for members of the Apple Developer Program, with public beta versions set to be released soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has begun testing a major redesign to the iCloud Mail experience on the web, bringing its webmail service more in line with recent design changes made in macOS Big Sur.





The new design, currently in beta, reported first by 9to5mac, features a cleaner overall design and feel than the current public experience of ‌iCloud‌ Mail for the web. The current, soon-to-be previous version features thin typography, lighter colors, and design elements from iOS 7. Additionally, the new design allows users to compose emails in a smaller window in the middle of the screen, compared to opening an entirely new window.



As the new design is in beta testing alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS Monterey, and tvOS 15, it will likely be made available for all ‌iCloud‌ web users later this fall. Users wanting to try the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design can check out the beta website for iCloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nashville Chatter Class has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database pointing towards several unreleased iPhone 13 models that Apple will be launching in the fall.





Versions of iPhone running iOS 14 are listed with the model numbers A2628, A2630, A2634, A2635, A2640, A2643, and A2645. None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.



The EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.



Apple's 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end "Pro" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.



Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. See our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple is introducing a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera's viewfinder or in a photo you've taken and let you perform several actions with it. 





For example, Live Text allows you to capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call, or look up a location name in Maps to get directions. It also incorporates optical character recognition, so you can search for a picture of a handwritten note in your photos and save it as text. 



Live Text's content awareness extends to everything from QR codes to emails that appear in pictures, and this on-device intelligence feeds into Siri suggestions, too. 





For instance, if you take a picture that shows an email address and then open the Mail app …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook has announced new features for its Messenger app, including a quick reply bar, QR codes, and new chat themes.





The new quick reply bar can be found in the Messenger media viewer, and aims to make it easier to chat about media posted by friends without needing to go back to the main chat thread.



Users can tap on a photo or video and send a response via the quick reply bar, which lives at the bottom of the screen, then swipe up to exit the fullscreen media viewer to return to the main chat thread.





Three new chat themes, which are available in both Messenger and Instagram in chat settings, let users add new twists to their chat thread backgrounds. The themes include Olivia Rodrdigo, World Oceans Day, and F9: Fast and Furious.



In addition, Facebook is adding QR codes and payment links for use with Facebook Pay, allowing users to make payments even if they're not on Facebook. 





To access a personal QR code and payment link, go to Messenger settings and tap "Facebook Pay." Users can share the payment link or allow friends to scan the QR code to send or request money.



The new features are rolling out now to Facebook Messenger, which is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

It’s exquisitely well done, very fun to play with, and surprisingly usable. And what a remarkable testimony to the expressiveness of Swift UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Screen Times:
At the end of last week we detailed an update to the HBO Max Apple
TV app that introduced a whole host of issues, making the app
almost unusable. Check out our article for the very long
list. The issues were so bad that HBO exec Andy Forssell even
addressed them in a reply to John Siracusa on Twitter.
Thankfully, HBO has now issued a software update that reverts the
playback UI to the original tvOS version. I’ve verified this in
the 50.30.2 update and can confirm everything is back to normal
from skipping ahead to asking Siri ‘What did they say?’ and
everything in between.
You make a mistake, you fix it as fast as you can. Kudos, HBO Max tvOS team. 
Someone should send this to the new team behind the MLB app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At TED2020, Ethan Hawke gave a remote talk about the benefits of being creative. As someone who often struggles to find meaning in whatever it is I do here, this bit was especially good to hear:
Do you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?”
Or the inverse — something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance. We need it.

Kranz founded Canoo, a self-driving car startup that he left earlier this year. Prior to creating Canoo, Kranz helped to develop the i3 and i8 vehicles at BMW, where he was employed for 30 years.



According to Bloomberg, Kranz's hiring is a sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving vehicle that will rival Tesla. Kranz will report to Apple Car lead Doug Fields, who works under AI chief John Giannandrea.



Rumors about Apple's car project have picked up in recent months as Apple now appears to be looking for suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop the vehicle. There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai's Kia division, but it's not clear if that relationship has progressed.



Development on the ‌Apple Car‌ remains in the early stages, and Bloomberg suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.

Fight Deadites with three friends (and one frenemy)
 On Thursday at the Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at the gameplay of Evil Dead: The Game, an upcoming co-op shooter. Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.
One player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they’re tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It’ll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it’s controlled by a skilled player.
While moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It’ll also be necessary to actively manage your player character’s fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.
Evil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:
On the macOS Monterey features page, fine print indicates
that the following features require a Mac with the M1 chip,
including any MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac
model released since November 2020:
Portrait Mode blurred backgrounds in FaceTime videos
Live Text for copying and pasting, looking up, or translating
text within photos
An interactive 3D globe of Earth in the Maps app
More detailed maps in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles,
New York, and London in the Maps app
Text-to-speech in more languages, including Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian, and Finnish
On-device keyboard dictation that performs all processing
completely offline
Unlimited keyboard dictation (previously limited to 60 seconds
per instance)
Apple has not explained why any of these features are not
available on Intel-based Macs. For what it’s worth, Google Earth
has long offered an interactive 3D globe of the Earth on
Intel-based Macs both on the web and in an app.
I don’t think Apple has to explain. These features all clearly are built on code that uses features exclusive to Apple Silicon. E.g. for Portrait Mode in FaceTime, it uses the M1 imaging pipeline — the same thing that makes all FaceTime footage on the M1 MacBooks look so much better than on any Intel MacBook, even though the camera hardware is the same. The speech/dictation features on this list are surely using the Neural Engine, something Intel Macs don’t even have.

The trailer shows a tragic backdrop to a tranquil scene
 Planet of Lana is a beautiful new cinematic puzzle adventure game from the Swedish indie studio, Wishfully. It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.
The story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana’s sister. Their planet — which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature — has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.
What’s interesting though, is that this game expressly isn’t about war or conflict. “This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet –and the journey to keep it that way,” a description from the developers said. 
The world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. 
A release shared that the visual style “combines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.” The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, “allowing its incredible artwork to come to life.”
In the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There’s a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. 
However, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It’s a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. 
Planet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.]]></summary>

FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022
 Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.
The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.
Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses!
Check out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.


The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.
Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.”
FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.
Elden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-06-10T19:44:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good overview of one of this week’s biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:
Apple’s iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it
routes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address
from the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever
manages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is
generally just one server between you and the website you’re
visiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ↔︎ VPN
Server ↔︎ Website. Private Relay adds another server to the
mix, which ensures that no one in the chain — not even Apple — can see the whole picture: You ↔︎ Apple’s Ingress Server ↔︎
Content Provider’s Egress Server ↔︎ Website.
This is, as Apple calls it in their “Get Ready for iCloud Private
Relay” WWDC Session on the topic, “Privacy by Design.”
Apple made specific mention that while the “Ingress Proxy” servers
are run by Apple, the “Egress Proxy” (aka the server which
communicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by
Apple and is under the control of “a (trusted) content provider”.
This means that Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting,
and the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.
I’m using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn’t seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail’s new tracker privacy protection), even though I’ve got an Apple One family account. I “fixed” that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1 — just figured I’d mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.

Less Masquerade, more mass murdering
 Developer Sharkmob is creating a new game in the Vampire: the Masquerade universe, but it’s a far cry from the dialogue-heavy RPGs that are common to the franchise. Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.
We saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. 
There’s an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.
Bloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021. Players can sign up for a closed alpha test on the game’s official website.]]></summary>

‘We cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with’
 CD Projekt, the parent company of the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, announced Thursday that the data breach it suffered earlier this year is potentially more damaging than originally thought. The news was announced during the high-profile industry premieres showcased during the Summer Game Fest, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
In early February CD Project announced that it was targeted by a “cyber attack” and that data, including video game source code, had been stolen. At the time, the Polish company said that “certain data” was being ransomed by unknown parties. It did not confirm the type of data stolen.

Plus, two new roles: the Sherriff and the Scientist
 Among Us’ next update got partially revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream on Thursday, and it includes a new map, new colors and cosmetics, new roles, and a Hide and Seek mode. There’s no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.
The new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We’ll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.
There are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.
Among Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It’s a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it’s still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.]]></summary>

 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting another new season, but there won’t be a whole new map this time. We got a preview of the season’s changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.
The largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. 
Meanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what’s next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn’t clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. 
Call of Duty: Warzone’s previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo. While this patch certainly seems to be smaller than that, it does seem like it will have plenty of new additions to the game for players to check out over the next few months. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone season 4 will start on June 17.]]></summary>

Much of this tracking is facilitated by remote images that load when viewing an email, and some of it is even sneakier, with advertisers using invisible tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are hidden graphics that you might not see in an email, but your email client loads them, allowing senders to gather data from you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I learned about bonsai trees as a kid, I’ve been fascinated with them. In my 20s, my girlfriend bought me a juniper bonsai for my birthday. I was really excited to see what I could do with it, but it was dead in a month and a half, forever dimming my enthusiasm for ever practicing bonsai myself. But I still love observing the process and seeing the results, so I’ve enjoyed watching Bucky Barnes’1 Bonsai Releaf videos. His latest video (above) documents the year-long transformation of a Japanese larch tree he purchased for £30 into something that looks like it’s been majestically clinging to a windswept cliff for hundreds of years.
Observation, healing, experimentation, growth, making irreversible choices — so many lovely little themes, lessons, and moments in this video. At one point, well into the process, he clips off most of a long branch and I exclaimed “Oh my God!” out loud. I guess I still need to work on letting go of attachments.

No, not that one.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced that following beta testing for a small group of users, it plans to launch its xCloud game streaming service on Apple devices via Safari "in the next few weeks."





Microsoft has been attempting to launch its game streaming service, which allows users to stream games from the cloud rather than store them locally on the device, on Apple's platforms for some time. Microsoft and Apple got into a heated public argument last year over App Store guidelines that rejected apps such as xCloud from being available on the ‌App Store‌. Apple eventually changed the policy, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. 



Microsoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on iPhone and iPad. Alongside xCloud on Safari, the streaming service will also launch on Edge and Chrome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One small but useful new feature introduced in iOS 15 is the ability for customers to request refunds for in-app purchases directly within an app, rather than having to use the Report a Problem page on Apple's website.





Apple has introduced a new StoreKit API that allows developers to implement a "Request a Refund" option within their apps. Users can tap on this option, select a specific in-app purchase, identify the issue that prompted the refund request, and tap the Request Refund button. Once the request is submitted, customers will receive an email from Apple with an update on the status of their refund within 48 hours.



When requesting a refund within an app, customers still have the option to visit the Report a Problem page on Apple's website to check the status of claims.



‌iOS 15‌ is available now in beta for developers, and will be publicly released in the fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On iOS and iPadOS 15, Apple is adding new functionality to WidgetKit, introduced last year, that will allow developers to classify information deemed as sensitive in their widgets, meaning that specific information will only become viewable on the lock screen when the user unlocks their device.





iOS 14 introduced completely redesigned ‌widgets‌ for the lock screen and Home Screen. While there are no major changes to WidgetKit this year, the new password-protected feature may be welcomed by apps that feature ‌widgets‌ with sensitive information, such as health and banking information. Widgets are accessible on the lock screen by swiping left to Today View.



Related to ‌widgets‌ on iOS 15 is new functionality for Smart Stacks. Smart Stacks allows users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to be shown depending on factors such as time of day, location, and more. 



On ‌iOS 15‌, the system can now automatically add widgets to Smart Stacks that it believes are relevant. The feature called Widget Suggestions is a new way for users to discover ‌widgets‌ they may not have known existed. Developers interested in learning more about the changes in ‌iOS 15‌ can check out this WWDC session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Apple acquired the weather app Dark Sky, and shortly after its purchase, Apple shut down the app for Android. Despite the revamped iOS 15 Weather app taking heavy inspiration from Dark Sky, the weather's app standalone iOS app, web app, and API will remain available until the end of next year, compared to the end of this year, as previously planned.





Dark Sky announced in an update to its blog that "support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022," and that the iOS and web app will also remain available until the end of next year. Dark Sky had originally planned to shut down its web app alongside the closure of its Android application; however, that was delayed indefinitely.



A number of popular third-party iOS weather apps have relied on the Dark Sky API over the years, and those apps will be able to continue functioning through next year without needing to migrate to a new provider.



The revamped Weather app on iOS 15 includes several features in which Apple is taking clear inspiration and value from its Dark Sky purchase. Alongside a fresh new design, ‌iOS 15‌ includes live weather notifications, graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple introduced a new MailKit framework for macOS Monterey that enables developers to create Mail app extensions that block content, perform message and composing actions, and help with security.





There will be four main categories of Mail app extensions, according to Apple:
Compose: Extensions that provide new workflows when composing emails


Actions: Extensions that apply custom rules to incoming emails, such as an email being color coded, moved to a separate inbox, marked as read, or flagged


Content Blocking: Extensions that serve as WebKit content blockers for emails based on specific criteria in an email's HTML code


Message Security: Extensions that sign, encrypt, and decrypt emails when sending and receiving mail, with signed and encrypted icons below emails
Xcode 13, available in beta, includes a template for developers looking to create Mail app extensions on the Mac. The extensions can be built into existing Mac apps and can also be distributed through the Mac App Store, according to a WWDC session about MailKit, which is available on macOS only and not iOS or iPadOS.



In the WWDC session, Apple indicated that older Mail app plug-ins will stop functioning in an unspecified future macOS release.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July.

The new reminder, first spotted by The Verge, is part of a wider assortment of changes and new features coming to ‌FaceTime‌ with the release of ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this fall. Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.



Apple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, including those on Android and Windows, brand-new SharePlay functionality, and more.

A winger, at long last!
 As the draft board rolls on, we’ve finally got our first winger entering the mix, would you look at that!
It was something of a strange season for Guenther, in truth—because of COVID restrictions and the WHL starting their season late, he didn’t really play a whole lot. He started with Sherwood Park of the AJHL on a loan, got in four games with them before returning to Edmonton, and then played 12 games with them. It wasn’t a whole lot of playing time to work with, but Guenther sure made the most of it, cruising with a cool 2 points per game pace in the WHL, and that’s a performance that’s certainly turned a number of heads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple says that starting at a future date, it will offer members of the Apple Developer Program access to beta versions of AirPods Pro firmware updates before they're released and shipped to the public.





Apple made the announcement for developers on the downloads page where beta versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS are available. According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. 

Pre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date. This will allow development of features on iOS and macOS for AirPods as well as enable new features, including Conversation Boost (beam forming) and Ambient Noise Reduction (noise suppressor).
Currently, Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, and AirPods Max, although there's no reliable way to manually update the devices. Instead, they're updated automatically when connected to power and nearby a paired iPhone or iPad with an internet connection. 



It remains unclear how Apple will provide beta versions for ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware. Presumably, Apple will provide a profile for developers to download that automatically installs and updates the ‌AirPods Pro‌ when there's a new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today launched a promotion in Canada that offers a $75 Apple Store gift card with the purchase of a new iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini through June 28. The offer does not apply to the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max.





The offer is valid in Canada at physical Apple Store locations, through Apple's online store, in the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE for iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini purchases made between June 10 and June 28. Purchases made with carrier financing are eligible, with full terms and conditions outlined on Apple's website.



Apple's online store went down earlier today in Canada, likely in relation to this promotion launching. The offer does not appear to be available in the United States or other countries at this time, nor does it apply to any other products.



Apple released the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in October 2020, and introduced a purple color option for the devices in late April.

Users have always been able to locate their ‌AirPods‌ through the ‌Find My‌ app within Bluetooth range. Now, with ‌iOS 15‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ can tap into the ‌Find My‌ network to relay their approximate location, even if they're out of Bluetooth range from the owner. ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will still need to be within close proximity to a ‌Find My‌ device, such as an iPhone, however. 



‌Find My‌ allows devices to crowdsource the location of other ‌Find My‌ devices, meaning even if they're relatively far away, ‌Find My‌ should be able to provide an approximate location.

Use the ‌Find My‌ network to get an approximate location of your missing ‌AirPods Pro‌ or ‌AirPods Max‌. This will help you get within Bluetooth range so you can play a sound and locate them.
Beats headphones, also owned by Apple, added support for ‌Find My‌ earlier this year. ‌Find My‌ also gained other new features in ‌iOS 15‌, including brand new separation alerts that notify users if a ‌Find My‌ compatible device is left behind, a brand new Find My widget for the Home Screen, and the ability for ‌Find My‌ to locate an ‌iPhone‌ even if its low on battery, or completely turned off.

        <updated>2021-06-10T10:23:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.





Trump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.



However, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. 



Biden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.



Going forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an "evidence-based approach" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those "in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary."



A separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains "very concerned" about the data risks of TikTok users.



Biden's order says collecting of data from Americans "threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information," and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that "pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. 





The original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. 





Another interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. 



Along with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. 





The prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 in 2015.



We haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‌iPod touch‌ in the works. The current seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Heath, for The Verge:
Facebook is taking a novel approach to its first smartwatch, which the company hasn’t confirmed publicly but currently plans to debut next summer. The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, The Verge has learned.
A camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission.
Sounds right. A tiny concealable camera to take surreptitious photos that upload to Facebook sounds exactly like something Mark Zuckerberg came up with himself.

It’s from Robin Dunbar’s recent book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our Most Important Relationships. You might recall the author’s name from his concept of Dunbar’s number:1 that on average people can maintain about 150 friendships with others, a limit that is determined by human brain size and function. The chart is a more detailed version of the concept: it shows, roughly, the number of people we can have meaningful relationships with at various levels of intimacy. Dunbar explains in this Atlantic interview:
The innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your romantic relationships. The next layer of five is your shoulders-to-cry-on friendships. They are the ones who will drop everything to support us when our wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:
From its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America’s pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation’s top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic’s collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (“If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,” Walensky said.)


The pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that’ll change for the better in the future.

A Clarke! (but not that one).
 We’re closing out the top-3 in our draft board, and we’ve got another defenseman on deck!
Coming in at third overall is Brandt Clarke, and it’s been a bit of a weird year for him. Clarke played his 2019-20 season with the Barrie Colts of the OHL, but because of the COVID restrictions in Ontario, the OHL didn’t play a season at all this year. So, to make sure he was still able to get some games in, Clarke shipped off to Slovakia for 26 games with Nove Zamky. Unconventional? Yes. But it was a very good season, all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world’s best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double — that’s three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what’s going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air — like absurdly and spectacularly high — and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing — it’s like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.
In reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: “How is that even humanly possible?” As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.

this week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy doing these quick hits on CNBC. I get on, I get a few questions, I answer as best I can, and I’m out. Two tidbits on my spot today:
It seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is a new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.


Another question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:
One of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam
Levine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he
was like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song
and he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do
with this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this
evolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with
this, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to
do this.
So we went after the labels and are going to the artists and
educating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because
we have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a
simple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through
this software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This
requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit
back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the
right things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s
worth it. […]
To me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for
music what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch
television that’s not in HD?
One of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take
an old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on
low-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things
were recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back
to a lot of the songs and be able to do this.
The article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Circa 1842, ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige released an 11-print series revealing the secrets of shadow puppetry performances. From the description of one of these woodblock prints held in the collection at The Minneapolis Institute of Art:
As comic entertainment, shadow performances were among the many diversions, including music and dance, offered at teahouse parties during the Edo period. In the eleven-print series Improvised Shadow Performances, Hiroshige depicted figures making shadows on shōji screens by contorting their bodies. The images demonstrate how to create ingenious shadows and could easily have been used as a how-to guide for clever shadow making.


You can find more of Hiroshige’s shadow prints at Ukiyo-e.org. (via colossal)

Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Illustrator and InDesign
will run natively on Apple Silicon devices. While users have been
able to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,
today’s development means a considerable boost in speed and
performance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent
increase in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent
improvement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.
Specific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster. Just from porting to run natively on Apple Silicon.
And we’ve only seen Apple’s consumer Apple Silicon chips for Mac.

A little more Wolverines love around here. 
 We’re rolling right along with our draft board, and coming in at second overall is another member of the University of Michigan’s stellar freshman class, in Matthew Beniers.
If you caught any of this year’s World Juniors, this is probably a name that you’re familiar with. Beniers picked up three points in seven games with the United States on their way to scooping up a goal medal, and while all eyes were on many of the big names on that team—2019 draftees like Cam York, Alex Turcotte, and Trevor Zegras—Beniers stood out for his motor that was helping to drive success for the US’s depth lines. 
His international success was just the cherry on top of a really solid season with Michigan, which saw him sco…]]></summary>

There’s a lot of directions the Flyers could go, which do you want to see them go in?
 Sign Dougie Hamilton? Trade for Seth Jones? Bring in some grit to the forward core? Blow up the core? Stand pat?  These are all options that have been floated around this team since it became obvious they were out of playoff contention. This is a huge off-season for Chuck Fletcher and the Philadelphia Flyers, who need to decide what they want this team to look like.
We as the fans need to know before games begin later this year to kick off the 2021-22 season, what is the Flyers identity? Before COVID shut the NHL season down in March 2020, the Flyers had a clear idea of what the team was. They were outstanding defensively, out-worked teams in the corne…]]></summary>

working on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:
If you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?
Of course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into
bugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I
figured them out!)
I got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to
talk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this
post, I’ll just try to classify them.
Here are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible
to understand. Each one of them has a bunch of sub variants which are bolded below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking of playing the lottery, Philadelphia is getting in on the lottery-for-getting-vaccinated trend:
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced today the launch of “Philly Vax Sweepstakes,” a series of three citywide drawings designed to give Philadelphians extra motivation to get their vaccination against COVID-19 as the city fully reopens this summer.
A total of 36 vaccinated Philadelphians will win cash prizes up to $50,000, totaling nearly $400,000 in giveaways. In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.
I really do love the idea of these lotteries and giveaway promotions. It’s innumeracy that leads some people to grossly miscalculate the risks vs. rewards of getting vaccinated, and it’s innumeracy that leads people to play lotteries. Sweepstakes for getting vaccinated put innumeracy to work.

America experienced 246 years of slavery before it was officially ended with the passage of the 13th Amendment. That was followed by decades of legal segregation and oppression under Jim Crow, followed by a period of willful blindness and denial. A tourist from a foreign land might well conclude that the Confederacy had actually won the Civil War, based on the number of monuments, buildings and boulevards still named for heroes of its defeated army. The real truth of our shared history was a casualty of that war and, like any wound left untended, the results can be catastrophic.
A full accounting of slavery is one of terror and trauma, and for decades the na…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a 3-minute clip of The Concert (or The Perils of Everybody) by choreographer Jerome Robbins, in which the dancers are intentionally, and comically, out of sync. You can see why it’s colloquially called the Mistake Waltz. Open Culture’s Ayun Halliday has collected several more of these performances in this post.
It must be incredibly hard for dancers to execute this piece, to deliberately perform out of step with the music and their fellow performers after a lifetime of practice & performance designed to drill the opposite instinct to them. Bravo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Filmmaker Morgan Neville (who did the Fred Rogers doc Won’t You Be My Neighbor?) has directed a documentary about Anthony Bourdain called Roadrunner that opens in theaters on July 16.
It’s not where you go. It’s what you leave behind… Chef, writer, adventurer, provocateur: Anthony Bourdain lived his life unabashedly. Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at how an anonymous chef became a world-renowned cultural icon. From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet From Stardom, Won’t You Be My Neighbor?), this unflinching look at Bourdain reverberates with his presence, in his own voice and in the way he indelibly impacted the world around him.


This trailer makes me want to buy a movie ticket — and about 10 plane tickets. So looking forward to this. I need more unabashed living in my life.

Over the weekend, Snyder published a short piece about what he believes will happen as a result of the 1/6 insurrection and the Republicans’ ongoing effort to push their Big Lie about election fraud — basically the end of democracy in America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good column (and video) from Joanna Stern on Apple’s “walled garden”. The people who use the term “walled garden” in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that’s not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice — and the walls and gates can be what makes them nice. That’s been a recurring theme in the testimony from Apple executives in the Epic trial. Asked about rules and limits on iOS that Epic presents as nefarious — nothing but tricks to lock users in — Apple witnesses typically responded by presenting them as features. That iOS is wildly popular not despite the “walls”, but because of them.
It’s a trade-off, for example, that anything you can install on iOS can be trivially uninstalled just by deleting the app icon from your home screen. The downside is that iOS doesn’t support any third-party ideas that would require system-level background agents or extensions. I can name dozens of great Mac utilities that I’d enjoy, if not love, on iOS, but which can’t exist on iOS because of the rules. That sucks. But those same rules mean there’s no way to mess up your iPhone or iPad by installing something you don’t like and which is difficult to uninstall. That’s great.
Better than “walled garden”, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They’re fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They’re also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks. Public parks are great too — in very different ways. We should have great public parks, and we should have great open computing platforms. But not every park should necessarily be public, and not every closed computing platform would be better off open.

The bottom line is, the viewing experience in the HBO Max app is
now horrifically bad and almost unusable unless you’re planning
just to play and pause. If you need to do anything else, don’t get
your hopes up.
The fact that they completely broke fast-forwarding and rewinding is mind boggling. Those aren’t exactly obscure power user features. Just use the standard video player. I don’t know how this update shipped. (The worst part is, my wife and I are hooked on Mare of Easttown, and have been binging it all week. Really sucks not being able to do anything except play and pause.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1,400 words to say they’d prefer a policy that allows teams within Apple to determine their own remote work policies. Good communication is to the point, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel “unheard”. It’s hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ✊🍆 vibes. The “formal requests” at the end about employees with disabilities and the “environmental impact of returning to onsite [sic] in-person work” are such transparent pandering. (I have never once heard of Apple not doing whatever it takes not only to accommodate employees with any disability, but to make them feel welcome.)
And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days remote is a huge change for Apple.
Given that these letters keep leaking to Zoe Schiffer at The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple is that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot of people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a mistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack. Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on site” policy wasn’t a request for comments — it was a decision — and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.

We are today announcing new enforcement protocols to be applied in
exceptional cases such as this, and we are confirming the
time-bound penalty consistent with those protocols which we are
applying to Mr. Trump’s accounts. Given the gravity of the
circumstances that led to Mr. Trump’s suspension, we believe his
actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit
the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols.
We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the
date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.
As part of this decision, Facebook is rescinding the special privileges heretofore extended to world leaders and political figures that largely exempted them from Facebook’s content policies on the grounds of “newsworthiness”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free Mac utility from Andreas Hegenberg, developer of BetterTouchTool and BetterSnapTool:
KeyboardCleanTool is a super simple little tool which blocks all
Keyboard and TouchBar input.
In 2011 Apple rejected the app for the Mac App Store because
apparently it’s “not useful”, however I often use it to clean my
MacBook keyboard without producing annoying input.
I have also heard of people who use it to let their toddlers
pretend they work on a computer.
The app has been around for 10 years, but I don’t recall hearing of it before. It’s more useful than ever today, because modern MacBooks will power on with the press of any key on the keyboard. It used to be that you could wipe your keyboard clean while powered down, but Apple changed that a few years ago, apparently because a fair number of users were confused how to turn their MacBooks on, now that the power/Touch ID button has no power icon. (Joanna Stern and I talked about this on the most recent episode of The Talk Show.)
KeyboardCleanTool is a great solution.
Update: See also: Shaun Inman’s Little Fingers, a similarly-purposed utility that also blocks input from the mouse/trackpad.

Bing, the search engine owned by Microsoft, is not displaying
image results for a search for “Tank man,” even when searching
from the United States. The apparent censorship comes on the
anniversary of China’s violent crackdown on protests in Tiananmen
Square in 1989. […]
Bing displays ordinary, non-image search results for “tank man”
when searching from a U.S. IP address; the issue only impacts the
Images and Videos tabs. Google, for its part, displays both when
connecting from the same IP address.
Motherboard verified that the issue also impacts image searches on
Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, which both use Bing. Neither company
immediately responded to a request for comment.
George Orwell, 1984:
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the
right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written
messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the
side wall, within easy reach of Winston’s arm, a large oblong slit
protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of
waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of
thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at
short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were
nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due
for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying
about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest
memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on
a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden
somewhere in the recesses of the building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Moren, writing at Macworld:
Multitasking on the iPad is, to put it generously, a mess. Split
View and Slide Over, first introduced in 2015’s iOS 9 and refined
a couple of times over the years, have always had the feeling of a
band-aid slapped over a mortal wound. Their limitations (like the
dance of getting an app that’s not in your dock into Split View)
and awkward gestures (how many times have you activated Slide Over
when you meant to simply swipe) feel cumbersome, especially
compared to the multitasking we’ve always had on the Mac.
So I’m hoping that 2021 is the year that Apple finally cracks
multitasking on the iPad. I’m not sure exactly what that looks
like; there are those who argue for the wholesale transplant of
macOS’s windowing system, but that seems as though it might be
another imprecise fit borne out of convenience rather than actual
appropriateness. Fundamentally, though, the iPad has always been
built around the idea of one app on the screen at any time, and
it’s clear that simply won’t do in a world where people expect to
be able to run multiple apps at once.
It’s amazing how often I make a slide-over Safari “window” on iPad without wanting to. And then I’m stuck with a new Safari instance with no actual tabs. You can get into Slide Over inadvertently, and if you do, it’s hard to undo it. It’s like instantly creating detritus you need to clean up. iPadOS is the only GUI system I’m aware of that has “windows” that don’t have close buttons.
My wife uses her iPad Pro more than any other device. She loves it. But Slide Over was driving her nuts until I showed her how to turn it off. “Why is that on by default?” she asked.

The United States is roughly on track to meet President Biden’s
goal of getting at least one Covid-19 shot into the arms of 70
percent of adults by July 4 — if the current vaccination pace
holds. But demand for vaccines has decreased in much of the
country in recent weeks, and the promising national numbers (about
63 percent of adults have received at least one shot) do not
reflect the uneven rates among states.
Even if the country as a whole reaches the national target, at
least 30 states probably will not. And a handful are unlikely to
reach the 70 percent mark before the end of the year, a New York
Times analysis shows, potentially prolonging the pandemic.
On the bright side, even our worst-performing states on COVID vaccination rates — Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming,…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-secf60513daa/1/web/1"/>
        <updated>2021-06-04T15:43:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple’s Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the
biometric sensor; it doesn’t store biometric templates, perform
biometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,
having to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).
The Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be
securely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be
used, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and
matching operations and enforces security policies in the same way
it would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the
pairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
that is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the
user if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely
paired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure
pairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
keyboards.
So I was wrong in my article on “secure intent” this week — the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does not contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it’s paired. But this contradicts the Platform Security page about “secure intent”, which states: “the connection is a physical link — from a physical button to the Secure Enclave”. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac’s Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are
compatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch
ID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the
Secure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match — and
vice versa.
I did not know this — nifty.

United Airlines aims to bring back supersonic travel before the
decade is over with a plane that is currently just an artist’s
drawing — even the prototype hasn’t flown yet.
The airline said Thursday that it plans to buy 15 jets from Boom
Supersonic with an option for 35 more once the start-up company
designs a plane that flies faster than the speed of sound while
meeting safety and environmental standards.
United hopes to carry passengers on the plane in 2029. The airline
said the plane will reduce flights between London and the New York
area to just 3.5 hours and make Tokyo only 6 hours from San
Francisco.
The last commercial supersonic flight was in 2003, when the Concordes were grounded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Brooklyn company called Pliant Energy Systems has developed a prototype of an amphibious robot that can swim, skate, slither, and crawl through water and over all different kinds of terrain. The secret is an undulating propulsion system that can modified on the fly to adapt to different conditions.
Velox can use several modes of locomotion found in the animal kingdom using just one pair of “fins”. These fins are best described as four-dimensional objects with a hyperbolic geometry that allows the robot to swim like a ray, crawl like a millipede, jet like a squid, and slide like a snake.
A craft equipped with this system has unprecedented freedom to travel through a range of environments in a single mission. As an underwater vehicle, the robot’s ability to instantly reverse direction and do quick turns make it ideal for task such as coral reef inspection or dragon fish hunting where a craft must rapidly maneuver to look around and between objects.

        <updated>2021-06-03T20:27:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josephine Wolff, writing for Slate:
By all means, opt out of Amazon Sidewalk if anything about
this program makes you uncomfortable or if (despite already owning
a Ring or Echo) you don’t trust the company enough to share a
little of your home network with your neighbors safely. You’re
under no obligation to participate in this mesh networking
experiment, and it probably would have made more sense for Amazon
to at least launch the program with an opt-in model that gave
people more time to learn about how it works and whether they want
to be involved.
But if you’re just learning about mesh networks for the first time
and aren’t sure what to think, or whether this is something to be
very worried about, I really don’t think it is. If you’ve already
reconciled yourself to the privacy implications of owning an Echo
or a Ring, the additional privacy and security drawbacks of
participating in Sidewalk seem very limited and the benefits are
potentially considerable, for you and for everyone around you.
I like this take. The thing to consider is whether you trust Echo and Ring devices with your privacy. If you do, you might as well participate in Sidewalk. It’s not that different, conceptually, from Apple’s Find My network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Krebs:
Fake, positive reviews have infiltrated nearly every corner of
life online these days, confusing consumers while offering an
unwelcome advantage to fraudsters and sub-par products everywhere.
Happily, identifying and tracking these fake reviewer accounts is
often the easiest way to spot scams. Here’s the story of how bogus
reviews on a counterfeit Microsoft Authenticator browser extension
exposed dozens of other extensions that siphoned personal and
financial data.
After hearing from a reader about a phony Microsoft Authenticator
extension that appeared on the Google Chrome Store,
KrebsOnSecurity began looking at the profile of the account that
created it. There were a total of five reviews on the extension
before it was removed: Three Google users gave it one star,
warning people to stay far away from it; but two of the reviewers
awarded it between three and four stars.
Fraudulent reviews are a scourge. Apple’s App Store is riddled with them — I’m not sure I’ve seen a single story about a scammy app in the App Store that didn’t have a bunch of 5-star reviews. Amazon product pages are riddled with fake reviews too. There’s a huge cottage industry in paying for fake reviews in any online forum where reviews can come from anyone.
I don’t know what the answer is. Users think they like reading reviews from other users, but they have no idea how utterly untrustworthy unverified reviews are. There’d be outrage if Apple or Amazon simply pulled the plug on user-submitted reviews, or wiped the slate clean by nuking existing reviews and starting over with some sort of “verified reviewer” system. But the status quo is a cesspool of scammy reviews that many users believe they can trust. It’s a mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I’ve said before many times, I will never stop being fascinated by the work of Foley artists, the folks who make the sounds you hear in movies and TV shows. In this short film, we meet three Foley artists who work at Footsteps Studios, a custom designed facility in rural Ontario that includes a massive warehouse of props that can make any sound you can dream of. This video is full of lovely little moments and details — recommended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stack Overflow co-founder Joel Spolsky:
Today we’re pleased to announce that Stack Overflow is joining
Prosus. Prosus is an investment and holding company, which
means that the most important part of this announcement is that
Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the
exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to
the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t
expect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business
of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance,
and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in
place: we just have different owners now.
This is, in some ways, the best possible outcome. Stack Overflow
stays independent. The company has plenty of cash on hand to
expand and deliver more features and fix the old broken ones.
Stack Overflow is far from perfect — what isn’t? — but the world would be a far worse place without it, so here’s to hoping that Prosus is a good steward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Our Favourite Uses of Typography in Watches:
Good typography should be almost unnoticeable. Blending seamlessly into the rest of the design, it should tell you everything you need to know, without you being aware of it. Despite the many restrictions that are applied to dial layout, the creativity that can be seen in typography across horology is quite staggering. To put it simply, typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. As the dial is the main point of interaction with a watch, it is arguably one of its most important parts, and certainly one that can produce the most emotion. This is why typeface can play such a vital, yet subtle, role in how we experience and feel about a certain piece.

In 2016, Luke Aikins became the first person to intentionally jump and land without the aid of a parachute or wingsuit — check out the video above to see how he does it. At one point, his heart rate is displayed on the screen and I’m certain that mine was in the same ballpark just before he landed. I recommend you also watch a video of the jump narrated by Aikins as he talks through what’s happening before, during, and after the jump.
See also Gary Connery’s 2012 jump — he fell 2400 feet from a helicopter and landed on a huge pile of cardboard boxes with the aid of a wingsuit, which slowed his vertical velocity to about 15 mph.
FYI: The jump height of 25,000 feet seems impressive (and it’s probably trickier hitting the target from higher up) but in terms of speed, about 1500 feet is sufficient for a freefalling human in the spread-eagle position to reach their maximum (terminal) velocity of ~120 mph. Anything over 1500 feet, about half the height of El Capitan’s granite face, doesn’t add any additional speed. (via @mikeindustries)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Snell, in his wishlist for Mac news at next week’s WWDC:
One feature that the Mac desperately needs from iPadOS is, believe
it or not, Shortcuts. I’ve written elsewhere about this,
but essentially it’s easier for me to create automations for many
tasks on iOS than it is on macOS — and it shouldn’t be that way.
Shortcuts fulfills the promise of Automator in ways that Automator
never did, and while it’s got a lot of room to grow, it’s clearly
the future of automation on Apple’s platforms. Add in actions that
can run AppleScript, Automator workflows, and shell scripts, and
we’ll really have something.
I’ve gotten more into Shortcuts in the last few months, and I really hope this happens. I just wonder how Shortcuts on Mac could offer actions for things that aren’t possible on iOS, like Snell’s suggestion for being able to run AppleScript and shell scripts. I suppose they’d just generate an error on iOS, and you could use them in a cross-platform shortcut by conditionally testing whether the shortcut is running on MacOS — pretty much how it works now when you have a shortcut containing actions that require a third-party app to be installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by space-saving flat-packed furniture, scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a technique for making pasta shapes that start out flat when dry but “morph” into their final 3D shapes when cooked. The secret is stamping different groove patterns into the pasta dough.
The solution: something Wang, Yao, and their co-authors term “groove-based transient morphing.” They found that stamping flat pasta sheets with different groove patterns enabled them to control the final pasta shape after cooking. According to the authors, the grooves increase how long it takes to cook that part of the pasta. So those areas expand less than the smooth areas, giving rise to many different shapes.
The team found that the pasta reached its maximum bending angle after about 12 minutes and retained this angle for around 20 minutes before it began to bend back. The researchers were able to produce simple helical and cone shapes, as well as more complex saddles and twists (the latter achieved by introducing double-sided grooves).


I am assuming those grooves would also aid in holding sauce better, a topic we’ve delved into recently. You can read the full research paper on the morphing pasta here. (via the prepared)

great print quality!
I worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,
so they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m
delighted with how they turned out.
When I originally started working on this project I thought about using a

But if you get an overhead view, as in this video from Taylor Glenn, you can see that often there’s very little movement in two of the three dimensions. The mastery of these small movements combined with the sweeping up-and-down motions creates a compelling illusion for ground-based viewers. The power of a different perspective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a talk at the Ignite conference, Marcin Wichary created a looping video about looping videos — you know, when the action in a video loops back over previous scenes, adding new layers of interaction as time goes on. (Think Marty McFly revisiting scenes from Back to the Future in Back to the Future 2.) Most impressively: he did it all live — and here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to recent government reports, declassified data, media interest in those data & reports, and a long-simmering interest by the public, UFOs are back in the public imagination. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who is searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, says that there’s little chance that UFOs are aliens.
I understand that U.F.O. sightings, which date back at least to 1947, are synonymous in the popular imagination with evidence of extraterrestrials. But scientifically speaking, there is little to warrant that connection. There are excellent reasons to search for extraterrestrial life, but there are equally excellent reasons not to conclude that we have found evidence of it with U.F.O. sightings.


If UFOs are alien craft, we would never see them:
There are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently visited by aliens, why don’t they just land on the White House lawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative, perhaps best exemplified by the TV show “The X-Files,” that these creatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us. But if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem surprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures technologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances between the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams at night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.


More people talking about a thing doesn’t make it credible. More people talking about potential evidence of a thing doesn’t make it credible. Evidence makes something credible.

Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[macOS Big Sur 11.4, which was released this morning, addresses a zero-day vulnerability that could allow attackers to piggyback off of apps like Zoom, taking secret screenshots and surrepetiously recording the screen.





Jamf, a mobile device management company, today highlighted a security issue that allowed Privacy preferences to be bypassed, providing an attacker with Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, and other permissions without a user's consent.



The bypass was actively exploited in the wild, and was discovered by Jamf when analyzing XCSSET malware. The XCSSET malware has been out in the wild since 2020, but Jamf noticed an uptick in recent activity and discovered a new variant.



Once installed on a victim's system, the malware was used specifically for taking screenshots of the user's desktop with no additional permissions required. Jamf said that it could be used to bypass other permissions as well, as long as the donor application the malware piggybacked off of had that permission enabled.



Jamf has a full rundown on how the exploit worked, and the company says that Apple addressed the vulnerability in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.4, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that a fix has indeed been enabled in macOS 11.4, so Mac users should update their software as soon as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The three week Epic Games v. Apple trial wrapped up today, with a series of debates that were held in lieu of traditional closing arguments. The wrap up follows Apple CEO Tim Cook's testimony last week, which saw him grilled by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Apple's App Store policies.





As outlined by Protocol, at the conclusion of the trial, Rogers aimed to get at the heart of the dispute and determine what remedies might ultimately be appropriate.



As she did earlier in the trial, Rogers hinted that she may be leaning toward something of a compromise with a ruling that would see Apple required to allow apps like Fortnite to direct users to make purchases on the web rather than in apps, something that's currently forbidden by the ‌App Store‌ rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New MacBook Pro models are coming at WWDC, according to leaker Jon Prosser who has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple's plans.





Prosser provided no additional information, but there are new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the works. The new MacBook Pros will feature the most radical redesign to the MacBook Pro lineup since 2016.



Apple is planning to reintroduce the MagSafe port, and the 2021 MacBook Pro models will feature an HDMI port and an SD card reader in addition to a trio of Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, and multiple color options are a possibility. 



There will be no Touch Bar included, with Apple returning to a traditional row of function keys, and there will be a redesigned thermal system to accommodate the upgraded Apple silicon chips that the machines are expected to include.



Bloomberg recently said that the new MacBook Pro models will feature 10-core Apple silicon chips with eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, along with 16 or 32-core GPU options and support for up to 64GB RAM.



No other sources have indicated that the MacBook Pro models will be coming at WWDC, and it has been atypical for Apple to debut hardware at the event in recent years, but it is not unheard of. The new MacBook Pro models are expected to enter production in the second half of 2021, and reliable sources that include Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have suggested a launch in the second half of the year.

iFixit is tearing down the mid-tier purple ‌iMac‌ model with an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and 8GB RAM. It's worth noting that the internals of this model will look different than the internals of the base model with a 7-core GPU as the two machines have different cooling systems.



The base ‌iMac‌ has a single cooling fan and a heat sink while the higher-end 8-core GPU models have two fans and a heat pipe along with heat sinks, so expect the internals to look different if you have a 7-core GPU ‌iMac‌.

How to start your journey, and where it is all headed
 Biomutant is a role-playing game where your experience tends to be differentiated more by character alignment rather than by their build of attributes and gear. The first two hours of Biomutant onboard the player to the world’s lore; its combat, crafting, and other systems; and then send them off on their first main mission. 
This Biomutant beginner’s guide will help you understand the game’s story, the ethos that informs the choices you have to make, and the initial choices themselves, so that you can shape your character and your story in a sensible way.

Apple entirely overhauled the ‌Siri‌ Remote's design. It has an all-aluminum body that does away with the touchpad interface, instead adopting a touch-based clickpad and several additional buttons for control purposes.

 Victoria 3, a sequel so long-awaited by its fans the title has become a meme, is in development and coming soon. The grand strategy title was a keynote reveal of this weekend’s PDXCon, the annual gathering for all things Paradox Interactive.
Paradox’s Victoria series is a “society simulation” set in Great Britain during the time surrounding the industrial revolution. The most recent title was 2010’s Victoria 2 for PC. In the decade since, Victoria fans had beaten news or rumor of a sequel into a meme somewhat like the well-known Half-Life 3 meme. 
This weekend, the meme died. A Paradox Interactive community manager took to the official forums this weekend to start a meme contest for the game, posting this picture of game director Martin Anward (which Anward himself tweeted out on Friday.)

“Victoria 3 is instantly one of the most highly anticipated grand strategy games in Paradox’s history,” the company said in a statement, obliquely acknowledging its meme status. In the game, players take one of “dozens of nations,” not just the U.K., and lead it through a time of societal change, technological innovation, economic turmoil, and geopolitical rivalries.
Paradox’s news release did not say when Victoria 3 would launch, but did say it would be available for Windows PC via Steam, Xbox Game Pass for PC, and the Paradox Store.
As for the meme contest, I don’t know who won, but this was my personal favorite:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salvador Rodriguez, reporting for CNBC:
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on Friday said the social media company is
happy to pay Apple’s 30% commission rate on in-app transactions.
“We really feel like Snapchat wouldn’t exist without the iPhone
and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,” Spiegel
said on TechCheck. “In that sense, I’m not sure we have a choice
about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we’re happy to do it in
exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us
in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware
advancements.”
At first blush you might think this is lickspittle-ism. But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap.
But here’s thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. From Investopedia, citing Snap’s 10-K for 2020:
Substantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,
which accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in
revenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.
99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.
Find me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.

However, one notable feature that didn't get released today is the ability for two separate ‌Apple Card‌ accounts to be merged into one.





Apple announced the feature last month but didn't specifically pin a release date. Now, in a new support document, Apple says that starting later on in July, users will be able to merge two existing ‌Apple Card‌ accounts into one, and in doing so, be able to combine their credit limits. 

Coming July 2021: You will be able to invite another ‌Apple Card‌ owner to combine credit limits and form one co-owned account.1
The ability to share an ‌Apple Card‌ with iCloud Family members above 13 years old and the ability to co-own an ‌Apple Card‌ were released today as part of the iOS 14.6 update.

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is well over one hundred thousand light years across. We only see a pitiful portion of it. Although it contains several hundred billion stars in its expanse, we can only see a fraction of a fraction of them.
And even that doesn’t fully capture the essence of a galaxy, which also has planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and more. Galaxies are colossal objects, their true nature only becoming apparent to us a century ago.


I know I’ve posted photos like this before, but every time I see something like this, my mind boggles anew at the sheer scale and magnitude of it all and I just have to share it.
P.S. And Earth contains the only sentient life in the entire universe? Lol.

Announced last month, ‌Apple Card‌ Family allows families to share a single ‌Apple Card‌ with users above 13 years old with the ability to set a spending limit.





Following its release, Apple has shared two how-to videos on how exactly to share an Apple Card with your teenager or friend and how to co-own a single Apple Card with your significant other. The process for sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with a friend or teenager is enabled within the Wallet app on iOS 14.6 or later and requires that you be in an iCloud Family with the person you wish to share the card with.  








Last month, Apple also announced the ability for couples to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌, allowing them to build their credit score together. The process is similar to sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with your teenager or friend but requires you to share your spouse's annual income. 








‌Apple Card‌ Family is available today with the iOS 14.6 update.

Final Fantasy Origin rumored for PS5, PC
 Nioh and Ninja Gaiden developer Team Ninja is developing a new Final Fantasy spinoff action game for Square Enix, according to a report from Fanbyte. That game, reportedly titled Final Fantasy Origin, is expected to be announced in June in conjunction with E3 2021. Square Enix is confirmed to appear at this year’s E3.
Fanbyte’s report follows a series of rumors regarding Final Fantasy Origin, which has been compared to FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The Final Fantasy spinoff is said to be “more accessible [than Nioh] for a wider audience” and set during the events of the first game in the franchise. Origin is reportedly bound for PlayStation 5, with a Windows PC version coming later.
Another component of the rumor surrounding Final Fantasy Origin is that Team Ninja will release a playable demo of the game this summer to solicit feedback from players. The studio similarly released “alpha” demos of Nioh and Nioh 2 ahead of each game’s final product.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. That game features two characters based on the original Final Fantasy, the Warrior of Light (pictured above) and Garland.
Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.]]></summary>

At launch in June, thousands of tracks will feature Spatial Audio support, and more than 20,000 songs will support Lossless Audio. By the end of the year, 75 million songs will support it.

There’s other stuff too, but the bear’s fun
 Crusader Kings 3’s first major expansion is coming soon, and it’s all about your seat of power. Royal Court allows medieval rulers to hang out in a 3D throne room, meet with their courtiers, and hire bards to sing epic tales. 
Royal Court fleshes out one of Crusader Kings 3’s most intriguing elements — managing your home base. Players have to deal with unruly vassals and rebellions, hold feasts, seduce lords, and ferret out secrets. Sometimes, the stories that take place in the player’s own royal hall are far more compelling than anything that happens over foreign borders.
Therefore, it makes sense that Royal Court turns your throne room into a much more tangible place that players can decorate, show off, and fill with fun entertainment like woodworkers or, uh, angry bears.
The Royal Court expansion will also introduce hybrid cultures and new ways for cultures to develop and diverge over the years, allowing rulers to make new ways of life for their kingdoms and empires. A previous, smaller scale expansion in March added winter weather and Norse invasions.
Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court will launch later in 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past November, the Apple TV app made its debut on Xbox gaming consoles, now, the Apple TV app is gaining support for Dolby Vision on Xbox, offering viewers improved high dynamic range paired with Dolby Atmos for a truly cinematic experience.





Xbox says that to enable Dolby Vision for ‌Apple TV‌ on Xbox, users must first have a compatible TV that supports high dynamic range. With compatible TVs, users will find a new toggle under "TV & display options" in their Xbox settings tab to enable Dolby Vision. Additionally, not all ‌Apple TV‌ content will initially support Dolby Vision. 

To start experiencing it with a Dolby Vision compatible TV, you need to have “Allow Dolby Vision” enabled and checked in Settings > General > TV & display options > Video Modes on your console. You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.
The ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices such as the PS4, and select smart TVs. This is part of Apple's recent strategy to expand its services business to more customers.

Raid charts are a universal language in Destiny, and key to taking on its hardest challenges
 Vault of Glass, the original Destiny raid, made its debut in Destiny 2 on Saturday. Bungie gave the old raid a new coat of paint, and many teams — including my own — dove in to conquer the challenge within the first 24 hours. But even though we all knew the fights from the original game, it didn’t stop me and a host of my peers from participating in my favorite Destiny raid-race experience: chart-making.
Destiny raids are like a cooperative puzzle. Players normally need to communicate information about something that only they can see to someone else who has to apply that information. Shouting “the thing to your left” doesn’t usually cut it, especially in a day-one scenario,…]]></summary>

Meet Thunderbird
 Ubisoft is constantly updating Rainbow Six Siege, and a new Operator is coming to the game along with a slew of quality-of-life changes to the meta. Operation North Star is the next big update, and and the star is Mina “Thunderbird” Sky, an Indigenous Nakoda pilot with powerful healing tech.
Thunderbird carries a trio of deployable healing turrets known as the Kona Station.  She’s a flexible, fast Operator who can get around a defense site quickly to drop her Kona Stations. Players who enter a Kona Station’s radius are healed; the Station then goes on cooldown. Her weapon options include a Spear .308 and SPAS-15, as well as a backup Bearing-9 and Q-929.
Ubisoft is also reworking the Favela map, which is similar aesthetically but dramatically changed layout wise. The Operator Melusi is also getting a rework to make her less of a balance headache for players (her Banshee gadget can now be destroyed by a single bullet.) Operation North Star has tons of changes to make the game clearer and more fun, which are explained in detail on Ubisoft’s official site.
Operation North Star is live on Ubisoft’s test servers on May 25; it is slated to launch to all players in mid-June.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anker today is introducing a new set of gallium nitride (GaN) USB-C chargers that offer fast charging speeds for mobile devices in a design that's smaller than ever. The new Nano II line is available in 30W, 45W, and 65W versions, and Anker says it has improved the chips and internal layout of its chargers to deliver greater efficiency while generating less heat.





The 30-watt charger measures in at just 31.5 mm by 30.4 mm and about 38 mm deep. (The UK versions of all three chargers are about 1.5 mm deeper due to their prong design.) It can fast-charge an iPhone or iPad, and even fully support the latest MacBook Air.



The 45-watt version offers a bit more power to be able to charge a wider variety of notebooks and other gadgets, and it measures 37.7 mm by 35 mm by about 41 mm. It also features foldable prongs to make it less likely to be damaged or to damage other items when tossed in together.



The 65-watt version can fully power devices all the way up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it too features foldable prongs. The charger measures 41.7 mm by 36 mm by about 44 mm.



All three chargers are available for preorder on Amazon and Anker.com for US customers, priced at $29.99, $35.99, and $39.99 respectively. Versions for UK and EU customers will be available at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has filed the unreleased "Beats Studio Buds" in the FCC or Federal Communications Commission database under model numbers A2512 and A2513. The new filings come after the reveal of the new earbuds last week within the release candidates for iOS and tvOS 14.6.





The new earbuds feature a smaller design with no stem, much in line with what we're expecting to be a similar design language for the second-generation AirPods Pro. In addition, according to code found within the latest iOS release candidate, the new Beats Studio Buds will feature Active Noise Cancellation, currently a feature exclusive to Apple's ‌AirPods Pro‌ and AirPods Max. 





Today's new FCC filings reveal nothing new about the design or the feature set of the upcoming earbuds; however, its filing indicates that a release should be imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation redesigned Siri Remote features a touch-sensitive clickpad that can be used to navigate menus as well as fast-forward and rewind video. 





When you first start using the ‌Siri‌ Remote, touch surface tracking is on by default, but if you can't get on with the sensitivity or you're just not comfortable using touch controls on a remote, you can always customize it or turn it off. 





Change Siri Remote Clickpad Functionality



Launch the Settings app on your Apple TV.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select ClickPad.


Select Click and Touch to allow both clicking and touch surface tracking, or Click Only to turn off touch surface tracking.






Change Siri Remote Tracking Sensitivity



Launch the Settings app on your ‌Apple TV‌.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select Touch Surface Tracking.


Select Fast to make smaller thumb movements move farther on the ‌Apple TV‌ screen, or Slow to reduce tracking sensitivity.






If you're having trouble scrubbing through video when playback is paused, check our mini guide to make sure you're using the correct clickpad gesture.

from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Peter Fintl, the director of technology and innovation for Capgemini Engineering Germany, explained that Apple's movement in vehicle supply chains is noticeable.
We have seen enough echoes in the supply chain that we know Apple is really looking into every detail of car engineering and car manufacturing. But nobody knows if what Apple creates will be a car or a tech platform or a mobility service.
The report suggests that Apple's car project may not actually culminate in a consumer-purchasable complete vehicle. Instead, Apple may …]]></summary>

Canada still haven’t won a game. 
 On the eve of day four of the IIHF World Championships, taking place in Riga, Latvia, the standings don’t look as many had predicted.
At the top of each group stands Russia in A and Germany in B, par for the course, especially considering the hockey talent Germany has produced in recent years. In particular, Lukas Reichel, a player we were personally high on, has stood out with five points in his first two games. 
However, Canada have not won a game yet (their goal differential sits at -6!) and the USA find themselves in 5th place at 1-1 with a +3 goal difference. 
What a day!  Here are the standings after today’s six games at #IIHFWorlds.  pic.twitter.com/2LHp5racQk

It includes several thousand of some of the most popular websites, represented as distinct “countries”, which are grouped together with others of similar type or category, forming dozens of distinct clusters, regions and continents that stretch throughout the map, such as “news sites”, “search engines”, “social networks”, “e-commerce”, “adult entertainment”, “file sharing”, “software companies” and so much more.  In the center of it all can be found ISPs and web browsers, which form the core and backbone of the internet as we know it, while the far south is the domain of the mysterious “dark web”.

*The first round is going to be over fast; have you selected a bandwagon? A team from the Central Division, perhaps? [BSH]
*As more and more of these guys end up in the NHL, the one-stacked prospect corps will naturally thin out. Right now, who are the best of the bunch? [Inquirer]
*About those top prospects transitioning... Joel Farabee did that pretty nicely eh? We’re going to need him to get even better. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of getting better, we grade out this season’s bottom six forwards. [BSH]
*Kevin Hayes was playing injured this season. Which, frankly, seems obvious. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This weekend’s playoff action continued the excitement we’ve seen from this first round so far. Unfortunately, this weekend also brought us an incredibly scary moment for Leafs’ captain John Tavares. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*This weekend also brought a long suspension for Nazem Kadri. Which we are forced to compare to Tom Wilson. And then think about things. [Mile High Hockey]
*He’s appealing, though. [AP]
*And finally, another decision by the DoPS brings another round of calls for some kind of examination of the NHL’s discipline process. It just plain isn’t working. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

Specifically, some users are complaining that using the circular gesture on the new clickpad ring to fast-forward or rewind paused video isn't working as expected. Rather than scrubbing through video continually in the direction of the gesture, the video scrubs back and forth in opposite directions.



From what we've been able to work out, the problem seems to relate to a subtle additional gesture that users are missing out, either because it isn't very intuitive or Apple doesn't demonstrate it particularly well in the marketing material.

With no dog in the fight, it’s always fun to pick one.
 In the sleepiest days of the Flyers’ offseason, there’s not much to do in terms of leisure activities aside from watching baseball or playoff hockey. The latter might be a bit painful given the status of your favorite team, but fear not; we here at Broad Street Hockey are creating a brief, yet vaguely comprehensive guide to each division and the teams who you might choose to root for in their quest for the Cup. In the interest of hatred of rivals (a primary interest of any Flyers fan) the East division won’t be receiving this treatment, particularly because Philly fans are familiar with the teams included in that category.
