Grande could be the biggest thing in Fortnite since Travis Scott
 Ariana Grande is the next performer to get a massive Fortnite in-game concert. The popstar will be featured in-game as part of the Rift Tour event in August, Epic Games announced on Sunday with a short teaser video on Twitter. 
The Rift Tour event will be a massive in-game musical spectacular and will add several cosmetic items to the game, including an official Ariana Grande Icon series outfit to the shop — if certain leaks are correct. 
Excuse us, Ariana is coming!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shawn King, writing for The Loop:
But I remember having my spidey senses tingle last year with these
awards so I did some digging into it. The first thing I noticed
was you have to “pay to play” — that is, it costs $5.50 to submit
a single image with “discounts” given for multiple image
submissions. Paying to submit images to a contest is not
necessarily a bad thing but it always raises concerns for me.
Next up was the judges — or lack thereof. In an interview
with Input, the founder of the IPPAWARDS Kenan Aktulun
(whose Twitter account is protected) wouldn’t say who the
judges were:
I asked Aktulun to share some details behind the curtains about
the judging process. Though he wouldn’t say specifically who the
panel of judges was for the 2020 winners, he said they were made
up of a diverse cast of visual storytellers including
photographers and designers.
That’s always a red flag for me. Every reputable photo completion,
from Apple on down, lists the names of the people doing the
judging.
The prizes are sort of shitty too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the "Apple Watch Edition" collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple's retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.





Noted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his "Power On" newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn't stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.

Apple hasn't said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here's my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn't sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. 



We'll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn't surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what's the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? 
As Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of "Apple Watch Edition" models with ceramic and gold. Apple may also decide to end the titanium Apple Watch models later this fall.

Arc System Works’ long-running fighting game has opened up
 Guilty Gear is one of the longest-running legacy fighting game series out there. Since the first installment in 1998, it’s been held in high regard by fighting game diehards. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean much to the average gamer looking for a new fighting game to play. To attract new players, Guilty Gear needs to learn from other fighting games and change up its formula, something it’s done with great success in the latest entry, Guilty Gear Strive.


There are a set few fight game series that are able to crack that casual consciousness. Games like Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Super Smash Bros., and even Virtua Fighter are among the few that you may be…]]></summary>

“I think I had the same reservations that many people had,” Bob, who requested that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, tells Rolling Stone.
Then Bob saw a tweet from Goddess Alexandra Snow, a professional dominatrix and dungeon owner who operates Wicked Eden, a BDSM collective based in Columbus, Ohio. The tweet stated that any submissives who wanted to session with Snow in person would have to show proof of vaccination. Bob had been subscribing to Goddess Snow’s OnlyFans and “tributing” her (giving her money) for almost two years, and he got in touch with her to discuss whether or not he should get the vaccine. “It was less about convincing me and more about her confirming to me that it was the right thing to do,” he says. He got his final shot three weeks ago. “It [feels] good to know that I’m (hopefully) contributing to others not falling seriously ill,” he says. “And of course, it’s gratifying to know I’ve done something that Goddess Snow approves of.”
More like this, please.

Our Guardian is facing a never-before-seen challenge: local politics
 Since 2017, Destiny 2 players have had to contend with a game that by and large still silos off the most colorful aspects of its fiction in dense lore books; story moments are relegated to dialogue in the comms channel, the explosive defeat of Big Enemies, and the cameo appearance of NPC models who by and large just stand there, deliver exposition, then transmat out of the game space before we move on to the next weekly space wizard chore.
This is a problem that’s obviously on the minds of Destiny 2’s creators.
In Luke Smith’s 2019 blog post at Bungie.net, “Director’s Cut — Part III,” the Destiny 2 director lays out his vision for an “evolving” game world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telegram Messenger has received a major update to its video capabilities, including support for video calls with up to 1,000 viewers. 





Group video calls in Telegram allow up to 30 users to stream video from both their camera and their screen, and now a maximum of 1,000 people can tune into the broadcast. Telegram says it intends to continue increasing this limit "until all humans on Earth can join one group call."



Meanwhile, video messages now have a higher resolution, and any audio playing on the user's device will keep playing when a message is being captured so that it's included in the recording. 



In addition, users can now tap on a video message to expand it in the conversation thread. Tapping on an expanded video message initially pauses it, and it's also possible to fast-forward and rewind the message.



Elsewhere in this update, the media player now supports multiple video playback speeds, screen sharing has been added to one-on-one calls, the in-app camera supports all zoom levels a device is capable of, and the media editor includes new tools to illustrate photos and videos with drawings, text, and stickers.



Several other smaller tweaks and improvements have made it into this bumper update, and Telegram has further details in its latest blog post. Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since introducing the unified Find My app, Apple has been working to improve the ‌Find My‌ experience. iOS 15 brings some major new features to ‌Find My‌, including features like live locations and the ability to track an iPhone even after it's been erased or powered off.





This guide covers everything that Apple added to the ‌Find My‌ app in ‌iOS 15‌.



Live Locations


When you track a friend or a family member using the ‌Find My‌ app, it now shows continuous streaming updates on their location rather than updating with a new location every few minutes.



Apple says that this feature is designed to provide an immediate sense of speed, direction, and progress when you're looking at someone's location.

The show aims to find "unicorn" companies, which are startups able to reach a $1 billion valuation. A panel of investors called the "Circle of Money" serve as judges on the show, in a format that's similar to "Shark Tank." Circle of Money members include Steve Wozniak, Lance Bass, Moe Vela, Silvina Moschini, Alex Konanykhin, Scott Livingston, and Rosa Rios.
Unicorn is the name given to startup companies with a valuation of over one billion dollars. If you spot one and invest in it at an early stage, you could potentially earn enormous returns on your investment.

Get two weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Wormhaven
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, Warlock helmet)
5 wins — Sola’s Scar, Solar sword
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock arms)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter today to criticize Apple's App Store fees in a tweet that sides with Epic in the ongoing Epic v. Apple dispute.





"Epic is right," wrote Musk, before going on to call Apple's ‌App Store‌ fees a "de facto global tax on the Internet."



Musk earlier this week made veiled comments about ‌App Store‌ fees, but today's statement is a much more direct criticism.



During Tesla's earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was planning to let other companies use its charger network because Tesla does not want to "create a walled garden" and use that to "bludgeon" competitors. Musk said that this is a tactic used by "some companies," and then he fake coughed and said "Apple."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the iPad has long been the world's most popular tablet, newly published market research helps put Apple's lead into perspective.



According to estimates shared by research firm IDC, Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter of 2021. By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.





A big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.





iPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.



The launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.

According to the book, during a 2016 phone call between Musk and Cook that touched on the possibility of Apple purchasing Tesla, Musk told Cook that a purchase of Telsa by Apple could only go forward if he became CEO of the combined company. 
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk are talking on the phone. The 2016 unveiling of the make-it-or-break-it Model 3 is coming soon, but Tesla is in serious financial trouble. Cook has an idea: Apple buys Tesla.

If you’re Boomerang X-ing correctly, you’ll never touch the ground
 Boomerang X made me feel like a genius, like I was getting something over on a hard game by circumventing its level design. It wasn’t until I reached the game’s truly difficult sections — the end of the whole thing — that I began to realize I was not a god-tier game-breaking genius, but that developer Dang! spent the entire game teaching me to fly.
What originally felt like an overpowered exploit of Boomerang X’s mechanics turns out to be mandatory if you want to succeed.
What is Boomerang X?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago, Apple announced that it would be revamping its Maps app with more detailed maps, better road coverage, and faster and more accurate navigation. The improvements have since rolled out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and Apple is focusing on Italy next.





According to Apple Maps enthusiast Justin O'Beirne, Apple recently started testing its revamped Maps experience across the Italian Peninsula, including San Marino and Vatican City. The updated maps appear to be limited to devices with the iOS 15 developer or public betas installed for now, but at WWDC 2021 last month, Apple announced that its revamped Maps experience would be expanded to all users in Italy and Australia later this year.



In early 2020, Apple said it would begin rolling out the revamped Maps experience across Europe in the coming months, so other countries should soon follow. The updated maps provide more comprehensive views of roads, buildings, parks, airports, shopping malls, sports venues like baseball fields and tennis courts, and other details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s a description of what the machine featured in this video does: “The HD Video Feedback Kinetic Sculpture creates fractals and organic-looking images in real-time, without a computer: this is old-school video feedback.” But just watch the video for the full effect — this thing produces some amazing imagery.
This is part sculpture, part performance art, and may make the most complex video feedback ever created, using three cameras, two video switchers, a sheet of beam-splitter glass, and an HDMI input from a phone or live video feed.
Much like a musical instrument, the operator at the helm of this device plays it, but instead of making sounds, makes entire worlds, spirals within spirals, loops within loops, galaxies, classical fractal imagery and primordial organisms, leaves, trees, and insects. It really is the God machine.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *So now that Chuck is done (ostensibly), we’ve got the long hot August between us and players on the ice. Sigh. Anyhoo, Charlie looks at the last two moves Chuck made this week: Martin Jones and Nate Thompson. [The Athletic]
*If there’s one thing we can take from Chuck’s offseason it’s that he is ready for this team to win now. This isn’t a man building for the future. [NBC Sports Philly]
*But there were some risks taken. Last summer, Chuck bet that his players would repeat their performance from the end of the regular season. He lost that bet. This year, he’s better that a couple of his new players will improve. We’ll see how it goes. [BSH]
*We spoke with Alex from The Cannon to get a little inside information about Cam Atkinson. [BSH]
*Our pal Michael Raffl has found a new home down south. [Defending Big D]
*It seemed like a Vladimir Tarasenko trade was imminent. And it still hasn’t happened. What’s up with that? [ProHockeyTalk]
*If you were worried about Ron Hextall going to the Penguins and making them into a winner again... well, he’s doing Ron Hextall things over there. We’re fine. [Pensburgh]
*And finally, just in time for your ride to the shore today, Steph had a chat with Chuck Fletcher yesterday and we learned some good stuff. Really really good stuff. [BSH]]]></summary>

Apple adds UPI payments to App Store in India pic.twitter.com/idIeKbpwPP
— Ganesh (@ganeshkulkarni) July 30, 2021
 


The acceptance of RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI)  cards means Apple users in India will be able to use the domestic payment systems as alternatives to regular credit/debit card payment methods to add funds to their Apple ID balance. 



They can then use their ‌Apple ID‌ balance to buy apps, games, music, iCloud storage, and more in Apple's online stores.



RuPay was launched in India in 2012, and facilitates real-time electronic payments at all Indian banks and financial institutions. The massively popular instant payments network UPI followed in 2016.

The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia will soon require all its on-site employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as most of their patients are too young to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The hospital did not specify a deadline for employees to receive the vaccine, but said in a statement Thursday that it is “currently preparing for the implementation of a vaccine requirement.”
“We believe that it is our duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves, especially our young patients,” the statement read.

Final Fantasy 14 instantly makes new players shout ‘I need that’ at their monitor
 Starting a new MMO is one of the most daunting things a video game player can do. Games like Final Fantasy 14 have massive, sprawling worlds filled with hundreds of hours worth of quests and more systems than 10 AAA games put together. So shepherding a player through their first 10 hours and reminding them that this game is worth their time is key to a good experience. 
But nothing incentivizes a player to stick with an MMO than seeing all the cool shit you can unlock as you level up, and nothing does that quite as well as Final Fantasy 14.
Like many, I’m a longtime World of Warcraft player who finally decided to give Final Fantasy 14 an honest shot. I started making the jump to F…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is fantastic: for more than 60 years beginning in 1899, Lora Webb Nichols captured and collected about 24,000 photographs of life in a small copper-mining town in Wyoming.
On October 28, 1899, Lora Webb Nichols was at her family’s homestead, near Encampment, Wyoming, reading “Five Little Peppers Midway,” when her beau, Bert Oldman, came to the door to deliver a birthday present. The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.


You can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.

The ‘first and only expansion’ for Outer Wilds
 Mobius Digital’s time-looping adventure game Outer Wilds — Polygon’s Game of the Year for 2019, by the way — is getting an expansion. It’s called Echoes of the Eye, and it’s coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox One on Sept. 28.
Echoes of the Eye will “weave directly into the existing world and narrative” of Outer Wilds, said Mobius Digital creative director Alex Beachum. “If you played the game you might be wondering ‘How? And also why?’ And those are very good questions,” Beachum added.
Announced during publisher Annapurna Interactive’s showcase on Thursday, Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye is ... well, like the main game, maybe it’s better if you don’t know too much going into it? That seems to be the developer’s approach to Outer Wilds’ new content, but here’s the official description of what players can expect:
The hearthian space program has detected an anomaly that canʼt be attributed to any known location in the solar system. Grab your flashlight and prepare to illuminate the darkest secrets of the Outer Wilds... 

Beachum calls Echoes of the Eye the “first and only expansion” for Outer Wilds. Watch its “willfully cryptic trailer” above.
The original Outer Wilds is coming to Nintendo Switch this holiday.]]></summary>

An ode to jank
 One of my favorite games this summer is Necromunda: Hired Gun, which is a thrill ride of violence, guts, and gore in the grim darkness of the far future. The game is extremely fun, but also ... kind of sloppy. It isn’t quite broken, but it doesn’t fully work, either. 
In a word, it’s janky — and that’s part of why I love it so much. On one hand, jank breaks immersion and reminds us we’re playing a game, but on the other hand, it’s fun and often endearing. I’m not afraid to say it: I love these awkward baby horse games, and their stumbles only make them more endearing.
“Jank” is when the illusion of a world rips, and you can see the machinery underneath making the game work. Jank can manifest in silly looking animations…]]></summary>

Knock things over, claw up furniture, solve puzzles, and lick your own butt
 A new trailer for Stray, the futuristic cyberpunk adventure game in which you’ll control a cat, offers our best look yet at developer BlueTwelve Studio’s game. The cat-centric gameplay looks impressively authentic; as the titular stray cat, you’ll knock things over to solve puzzles and create new pathways, leap through a strange city with feline grace, and claw up furniture because you despise humans’ material investments.
Most of what you’ll do in Stray draws upon the real-world abilities of a cat. But you also have a helpful companion, a drone named B-12, who offers other gifts. B-12 will helpfully interact with objects in the world and communicate with the city’s robotic inhabitants. The cat will also have to avoid danger from rat-like creatures, but with the help of B-12, it appears the cat can turn the tables and kill them en masse with a purple light.
The cat can also very believably lick its butt, as seen in the GIF below.
Stray is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC sometime in early 2022.]]></summary>

Stylized action-platformer is coming to PC, PS4, and PS5
 Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine will release its next game, the 3D action-platformer Solar Ash, on Oct. 26, publisher Annapurna Interactive announced Thursday. Solar Ash is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.
Heart Machine first revealed Solar Ash in 2019 (as Solar Ash Kingdom). Players take on the role of Rei, a Voidrunner who will journey through a colorful, stylized world as she fights to save her planet from the Ultravoid. The developer promises fluid controls, with rail-grinding, grappling, and cloud surfing. 
“Solar Ash is Heart Machine’s vision of the adventure platformer,” game designer Alx Preston said of Solar Ash earlier this year. “The giant spaces, the feel of movement, the flow of combat, and the high stakes battles atop enormous beasts all come together to bring players something we think is incredibly unique, and more importantly, fun.”
In our review of the developer’s Hyper Light Drifter, we praised the top-down action game for its combination of story and gameplay: “It replaces traditional narrative structures with moods, but punctuates those contemplative, quiet moments with constant scenes of breakneck, pitch-perfect action. Getting those two elements to not only coexist but thrive together is a needle that Hyper Light Drifter confidently threads.”]]></summary>

 Watch out Ganon! You have a new hero sneaking up your way! Thanks to a mod created by AaronTheSnob, you can now play The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker as Solid Snake, the protagonist of the Metal Gear series. 
The “Snake” in the mod is done in the style of Wind Waker, so he has big eyes and cute, stubby legs. (The little sausage legs just dangle in the wind as he parachutes down.) He wears his hair up with his recognizable headband and dons the dual-toned tactical espionage suit Snake is known for.

A difficult game with a generous ramp
 A simple screenshot of Death’s Door evokes its Dark Souls influence without you even needing to know it’s the follow-up to Acid Nerve’s previous top-down boss-killer, Titan Souls. Death’s Door captures that FromSoftware gloom in an instant, but it’s a far more forgiving experience than its inspiration.
Where Soulsborne games build seemingly impossible walls for you to break down from the start, Death’s Door carefully ramps up its difficulty to create a fair and completable experience. It’s still a challenge, but Death’s Door reduces the likelihood you’ll hit an impassable wall by slowly pushing your boundaries.
What is Death’s Door?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This video from Vox takes a look at how Taiwan avoided a Covid-19 outbreak for more than a year (and kept total deaths to just 7 in 2020 in a country of 23.6 million) while residents were mostly able to go about their normal lives. The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:
This was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.


After more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now. When the rest of the world is teeming with the virus, it becomes more likely over time that even the most organized and protected systems are going to be vulnerable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aaron E. Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:
Many may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and
distancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well
enough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did
when we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are
less likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed
by those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be
fought and ignored by those who aren’t.
Hospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because
someone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring
because too many people are not immunized.
This is why I’ve advocated vaccine mandates. I don’t understand
how we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.
Here’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:
A year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an
obviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of
2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread
of Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term
solution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the
world could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.
Now those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of
summer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a
mask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and
federal governments — should consider mandating something else
first: vaccination.
Asking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. The backlash is growing.

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Own the game? You won’t lose it.
 Forza Motorsport 7 is a relatively young game, having only been released in 2017. Today, Microsoft announced that the game is about to reach “End of Life” status, which means it’ll be unavailable to purchase on the Microsoft Store or through Xbox Game Pass after Sept. 15. Players who already own the game will be able to download and play the game as normal, including multiplayer and other online services. Microsoft will also continue to run Rivals esports events with partners.
Players who own DLC for the game but access the main game through Xbox Game Pass will not be locked out of the game either. Microsoft explains how these cases will be handled. The post reads, in part:
For any Xbox Game Pass players who previously purchased DLC for the game, but not the game itself, we have good news! You will receive a token for the game through the Xbox Message Center so that you can continue playing Forza Motorsport 7. Token distribution will be through August 2. However, if after that date you have not received your token, please contact Xbox Support here. (Unused tokens will expire on September 15, 2023.)
If you know someone who has yet to play Forza Motorsport 7, we are offering a discount on the game in the Microsoft Store through September 15.
The next game in the series, which is simply called Forza Motorsport, currently has no release date, although it will come to Xbox Game Pass on day one.]]></summary>

‌‌The watchOS 7.6.1 update‌‌ can be downloaded for free through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the ‌iPhone‌ by going to General > Software Update.



To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery, it needs to be placed on a charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



According to Apple's release notes, the watchOS 7.6.1 update includes important security updates and it is recommended for all users. An Apple security support document indicates that the update fixes a memory issue that may have been actively exploited in the wild, so Apple Watch users should upgrade as soon as possible. This is the same issue that Apple previously addressed in iOS 14.7.1 and macOS Big Sur 11.5.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released the trailer for the second season of its Apple TV+ original show "See," which will premiere with one episode on the platform on August 27, with new episodes following every Friday. The second season of the show will run for a total of eight episodes.






"See" was one of the first shows to premiere on ‌Apple TV+‌ in 2019 and features Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, and Alfre Woodard. The show follows the story of humanity losing the ability to see, and according to Apple, the second season will tell the story of Baba Voss, played by Jason Momoa, attempting to be reunited with his family. 

“See” is set in a brutal and primitive future, hundreds of years after humankind has lost the ability to see. In season two, Baba Voss (Momoa) is struggling to reunite his family while protecting them as the threat of war looms between the Kingdom of Paya and the Trivantian Republic. Despite his best efforts, his wife and sighted children are pulled to the forefront of the conflict, where they come to the attention of his estranged brother, Edo Voss (Bautista), a powerful and cunning Trivantian general, whose long-simmering hatred for his brother imperils them all even further.
The show's second season premiere joins a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, with the second season of the hit comedy show Ted Lasso having premiered last week, and upcoming shows, such as "The Morning Show" with their second season premiering in September.

 After posting the NHL’s worst save percentage (.880) and allowing the most goals in the league a season ago, the Flyers are once again leaving their goaltending situation to chance in 2021-22.
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher has worked hard this offseason to try and improve his roster — adding defensemen Ryan Ellis and Rasmus Ristolainen via the trade market and dumped the offensive-minded Shayne Gostisbehere for cap space. Heck, he even swapped out a major defensive liability at forward in Jakub Voracek for the more defensively responsible Cam Atkinson.

Vice today highlighted that, in an extensive letter sent to a leaker based in China, Apple warned that leaks could give third-party accessory makers the wrong dimensions and details about unreleased products. It has emerged over the past month that June saw a concerted effort by Apple to curtail information coming from a range of individual leakers outside the United States using cease and desist letters.



Despite being sent by various local law firms representing Apple around the world, the letters appear to have featured identical content. An extract of one of…]]></summary>

The new labels, much like Apple's App Privacy labels, will inform users on what data an app collects about them, allowing them to make a more informed decision on whether to download a specific app.





Google has now shared additional information regarding the upcoming Play Store "safety section." In a blog post, Android's vice president of security and privacy, Suzanne Frey, laid out the company's timeline for when developers will need to adopt the new labels. Android developers will be able to begin adding their app's privacy information in October of 2021 and will be required to by April of 2022.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Full disclosure: stole that headline from a Charles O’Connor tweet. Because it would appear that, at least for now, Chuck Fletcher is all done. 
Based on Fletcher's availability today, it really does sound like the Flyers are done for now. 
Next is re-upping Hart & Sanheim. After that, sounds like they'll reassess their cap, and see if they can do (or have to do) anything else. But this very well could be "pencils down."
— Charlie O'Connor (@charlieo_conn) July 28, 2021



*Anyhoo, it was a wild, wild day around the league yesterday, and while the Flyers didn’t do anything extra spicy, the did make some moves. They: 
Brought in Martin Jones to backup Carter Hart. [BSH]
Gave out another contract to... Nate Thompson. For some reason. [BSH]
Made the Keith Yandle deal we’d all heard about officially official. [Flyers]
And then added some AHL/press box depth in the form of Adam Clendening... [BSH]
... and defenseman Nick Seeler. [BSH]
*Speaking of Yandle, Charlie broke down what his impact to the team might be ahead of today’s frenzy. [The Athletic]
*Brian Elliott landed himself in Tampa Bay. Really glad he ended up in a good spot. Best of luck, BAMF. [Raw Charge]
*Around the Metro, the Hurricanes signed Tony DeAngelo. Big yikes. [Canes Country]
*The Devils signed Dougie Hamilton. Even bigger yikes, but a different kind of yikes! [All About The Jersey]
*And finally, as we said, it was a busy kick-off to free agency season. Here’s a handy rundown of every single thing that happened, in case you missed anything. [Sportsnet]]]></summary>

On the company's Q2 earnings call, the social network revealed it had accumulated $28 billion in ad revenue, representing a 56% year-on-year increase. That saw Facebook more than double its profits from the previous year, earning $10.4 billion, up from $5.2 billion in 2020.



Despite the figures for its main revenue stream, Facebook CFO David Wehner did note that the company expects to feel the brunt of Apple's App Tracking Transparency rules in the third quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bang & Olufsen today announced Beoplay EQ, the Danish audio outfit's first true wireless headphones with adaptive active noise cancelation.





To achieve maximum noise cancelation, the buds use adaptive ANC that combines active noise cancellation with passive sealing. Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.



The Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.



The compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They're IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. 





Wireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for iPhone licenses.



Beoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang & Olufsen's website and in Bang & Olufsen retail stores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zens today announced the launch of a new 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger that's designed to work with Apple's latest iPhone 12 models.





The 4-in-1 charger offers a magnetic charging puck that is compatible with the ‌iPhone 12‌. Zens says that it is a 15W magnetic charger, but it's worth noting that third-party chargers that are not using Apple's official MagSafe solution are limited to 7.5W Qi charging speeds.



The magnetic charger can be used with an iPhone in either portrait or landscape mode, and it places the ‌iPhone‌ at an ideal angle for watching videos, FaceTiming, and more.



In addition to the magnetic charging surface for an ‌iPhone 12‌, there's also a 5W charging pad that can be used for a second ‌iPhone‌ or for the AirPods.



For the Apple Watch, there's an included (and removable) Apple Watch charging puck, and along with these three charging options, there's a built-in USB-A port for charging a fourth device. The 4-in-1 charger comes with a 30W PD power adapter.



The 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger can be purchased from the Zens website for 139.99 euros, which is right around $165. Zens offers worldwide shipping.

Will more of the squad join the game too?
 Bloodsport is coming to Fortnite. The Suicide Squad sharpshooter’s appearance in the game was announced on Wednesday by Bloodsport himself, actor Idris Elba. The Suicide Squad director James Gunn originally tweeted a video about the crossover.
In the video, we get a brief glimpse of Bloodsport wreaking havoc on the Fortnite island, taking ziplines, and firing off rocket launchers — which certainly seems to fit his vibe from the trailers. According to Elba, Bloodsport is coming to the island soon; the video ends with a tease saying that we’ll get more information about The Suicide Squad’s tie-in with Fortnite sometime on Thursday. 
Oh yeah. #Fortnite fans prepare to get some dubs. @FortniteGame @idriselba pic.twitter.com/rlNQP0tk1l

This isn’t the first time that DC Comics heroes have made their way to the island. Batman and his rogues’ gallery have shown up in the past, along with a few other DC heroes and villains. Hopefully this new Suicide Squad event will include a few more of the upcoming movie’s characters as well. 
This story will be updated when Epic and Warner Bros. reveal more about the collaboration on Thursday. The Suicide Squad will be released in theaters and on HBO Max on Aug. 6.]]></summary>

It’s a start
 Fans don’t like the teeny, tiny font in the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, but that’s not stopping them from fixing it.
On Wednesday Square Enix released the Pixel Remasters of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 2, and Final Fantasy 3 on Android, iOS, and Windows PC. The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.
It started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. 
Some held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. 
As it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.
Polygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.]]></summary>

 The 1963 Aston Martin DB5 — the most recognizable of all the James Bond cars — crosses over to Rocket League beginning July 29.
Thanks to a deal with MGM (and, one assumes, the carmaker, too), players can get the star of 1964’s Goldfinger for 1,100 Credits from the Item Store on Thursday. Psyonix said in a news release that more of James Bond’s vehicle fleet will be made available later this year. This is all presumably a tie-in with No Time to Die, the latest Bond flick, which was originally due to premiere in 2020 but was delayed repeatedly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film, Daniel Craig’s last as Bond, will be released Sept. 30.
In Rocket League, the Aston Martin DB5 uses the Octane hitbox. It does not come equipped with pop-out machine guns, a rotating license plate, a rear-window bullet shield, or an ejection seat. But it does have a rocket boost, and it drives around with the real DB5’s signature engine note.
The car is part of a bundle that includes 007’s Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, although they can only be equipped on this car. Buyers also get the Reel Life Decal.
Rocket League last crossed over with Hollywood in June with a three-car Fast & Furious bundle, each of which also offered a Reel Life Decal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customers who visit U.S. Apple Stores will once again be required to wear masks at most retail locations, reports Bloomberg.





Apple dropped its mask requirement for vaccinated customers and employees back in June, but earlier this month, Apple began requiring employees in select regions to wear masks and encouraged other employees to do so.



Now both customers and employees in areas where the COVID-19 virus is prevalent will need to wear masks when inside an Apple retail location, and this also pertains to those who are vaccinated. Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.



Apple informed employees about the change in a memo:
"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated." The company added it is making the change "out of an abundance of caution."
In addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. "Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it," reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.



Apple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using dozens of bot accounts, The Wall Street Journal did an investigation and determined that TikTok’s algorithm needs only one piece of information to determine what you want to watch: the amount of time you spend watching individual videos. Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.
As someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.

Chuck Fletcher adds a depth defenseman, formerly of the Wild.
 On what has been an incredibly busy day across the NHL, the Flyers evidently aren’t done yet. 




According to the Athletic’s Michael Russo, the Flyers are about to sign a defenseman that Chuck Fletcher will know quite a bit about. 
Per sources, #Flyers are signing physical, mobile former #mnwild and #gophers defenseman Nick Seeler.
One-year, two-way, $750K AAV, $300K minor, $350K guaranteed
— Michael Russo (@RussoHockey) July 28, 2021



Nick Seeler, 28, was drafted in 2011 by the Minnesota Wild (5th round, 131 overall). At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.
He was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. 
Seeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.]]></summary>

Chuck Fletcher adds another depth piece.
 Continuing a very busy, yet simultaneously quiet free agency for the Flyers, the Orange & Black have signed former New York Ranger Adam Clendening to a one year, two-way deal, and if the other two-way deals signed today are any indication, his NHL salary will be something in the $700-$750k range. With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.
Clendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. 
Philadelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo today announced that it is sunsetting Dr. Mario World for iOS, a game that launched just two years ago. According to Nintendo, service for Dr. Mario World is set to end on Monday, November 1.





As of today, diamonds, the game's in-app currency, are no longer available for purchase. Starting on November 1, Nintendo says an end-of-service notification will be displayed and the game will not be playable.






Players will be able to look back at their player history in "Dr. Mario World Memories," a web page that Nintendo plans to launch later this year. This website will use player history, and customers can avoid being included by deleting their save data in the app.



Dr. Mario World is a puzzle game based on the well-known Dr. Mario Nintendo title. Players are tasked with matching capsules with viruses in order to clear out all the viruses on the board, and Nintendo characters like Peach, Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba appear in the game.



Like Nintendo's other titles, Dr. Mario World is a free-to-play game that included optional in-app purchases, but apparently the game failed to catch on.



Bloomberg last year said that Nintendo is "retreating" from its mobile game plans, focusing on already-released titles rather than debuting new games. Nintendo has had success with games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, but has not been able to maintain sales momentum.



Nintendo previously discontinued Miitomo, Pokémon Duel, and Pokémon Rumble Rush. Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost, Super Mario Run, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, and Mario Kart Tour continue to be available.

Battlefield is built well for competition, and Portal’s opposing approach is something to celebrate
 Battlefield Portal is a new game mode in Battlefield 2042 that lets players mash up their favorite Battlefield time periods into a single game. An army of World War II soldiers against a handful of 2042 grunts; one tank against 100 tiny robots. It’s very ... FPS by way of Looney Tunes. Seemingly taking inspiration from Halo Forge, custom map creators, and other level editors, the mode promises something rare for the 20-year-old franchise: comedy.
But don’t expect Battlefield 2042’s Portal mode to be balanced for competitive play. Its focus is fun — the kind you can’t help but clip and share with friends.
What is Battlefield Portal?

‌AirTags‌ use coin-shaped CR2032 batteries, which happen to be a size that's easy to swallow. Some battery makers like Duracell have begun putting a bitter coating on CR2032 batteries to prevent children from eating them.



According to Duracell, hundreds of lithium coin batteries are accidentally swallowed by children each year, and these batteries can cause a harmful chemical reaction. The non-toxic bitter coating reacts with saliva and is meant to deter swallowing.

A familiar face returns to Philadelphia.
 The Flyers have brought back a name from the 2019-20 season in Nate Thompson to solidify their forward depth. The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange & Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.
Thompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.
With this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.]]></summary>

Well, there’s your backup goalie.
 After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.
Jones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.
Since the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charles Gaba has been graphing the Covid-19 vaccination rates of the 50 states (and DC) against the percentage of people who voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and there is unsurprisingly a clear correlation between the two:

As one commenter noted, all of the solidly “blue” states are above the vaxxed national average and all the solidly “red” states are below it. The picture is a little more muddy when you look at the rates at the county level:

The “conservatives are unvaxxed” trend is still there, but a lack of access and education around the vaccines in counties with large Black and Latino populations also plays a large role in whether people are vaccinated or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.





TSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.



For context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the "A18" or the "M5." While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple's sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.



TSMC's manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.



The A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple's first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.



TSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.

Techdirt is one of the very, very, very few truly independent media brands around. Almost none of the independent media brands that existed when we started remain. Some have been sucked up into larger companies or shut down entirely. Others have decided to go behind expensive paywalls. We’ve had to adapt and change over the years in many ways just to stick around, but in the end the reason we do this is because of the community we’ve built up here. For us to stick around, I need to ask the community to help support us as well. We have some cool experiments and projects in the works, so stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, if you can help us out, it would be hugely appreciated.
Techdirt is irreplaceable. There’s no other site like it. And indeed, indie websites that neither run crappy ads nor put their content behind a paywall are a dying breed. You go to an article at Techdirt and you see the article. No annoying popovers begging you to subscribe to a newsletter. You just see the article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I’ve written before, in the history of astronomy and astrophysics, women have made major discoveries and played a significant role in advancing our understanding of the universe but have often not gotten the recognition their male peers enjoy. In 1967, while she was working on her doctoral research with her advisor Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell Burnell (then Jocelyn Bell) discovered a new and unusual kind of object, the pulsar. In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.
In 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.
It’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.

 *Chuck is compiling quite a lot of natural leaders this summer. You love to see it.
Ryan Ellis, Cam Atkinson and Keith Yandle were all alternate captains last season on their respective former teams.
— Jordan Hall (@JHallNBCS) July 27, 2021



*That’s right, Keith Yandle! Chuck signed him yesterday. [BSH] [Inquirer]
*It’s free agency day, the new July 1, if you will, and the Flyers still need a goaltender. Let’s look at some options. [BSH]
*But might the Flyers decide to go the trade route instead? [NBC Sports Philly]
*Either way, Charlie has a full breakdown of the whole market and who might be best for the Flyers right now. [The Athletic]
*Chuck’s done a lot of adding on the back end, a little tweaking to the top end, but what are we looking at in the middle? [BSH]
*Anyway, let’s talk about Cam Atkinson. Let’s let his excitement infect us all. [BSH]
*Oh yeah by the way, the Capitals signed Alex Ovechkin to five more years. Dude’s 100% definitely getting that record. It’s going to be so neat. [Japers’ Rink]
*The Vegas Golden Knights traded Marc-Andre Fleury — he just won the Vezina, in case you forgot — for... nothing. Nothing. [Knights On Ice]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular Apple TV+ show "For All Mankind" is currently shooting its third season, but Apple may have already authorized a fourth season of the drama, if information on an updated Writers Guild of America (WGA) webpage is accurate.





First spotted by Space Explored on Tuesday, the updated webpage contains a listing for season four of the show that suggests everyone currently involved in season three will return for another outing. 



According to the entry, series creator Ronald D. Moore will remain as showrunner while also serving as executive producer, alongside series stalwarts Ben Nedivi, Bradley Thompson, David O. Weddle, Matt Wolpert and Nichole M. Beattie.



With season three expected to be released in mid 2022, the WGA page has season four production kicking off that same year and running into 2023, so it'll be a while yet before we see it on Apple's streaming TV service, assuming the listing is correct. 



"For All Mankind" has proven to be one of Apple's more popular ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. It explores what might have happened if the global space race had never ended in an alternate history where the USSR beats the United States to the moon. The story is told through the lives of NASA astronauts and their families, who are at the center of extraordinary events. Apple confirmed season three had been green-lighted in December 2020.

        <updated>2021-07-28T02:25:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Juli Clover, MacRumors:
Prior to this beta, Safari on iPad was similar to Safari on iOS
with no dedicated tab bar, but after the update, Apple has added a
dedicated tab bar that’s activated by default, which is the same
layout that’s now used in macOS Monterey.
While the separate tab bar is enabled automatically when updating,
in the Safari section of Settings, there is an option to toggle on
the original compact tab bar that merged everything together.
This is a significant improvement for Safari on iPad, and showing the tab bar is the correct default. If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federico Viticci, on Twitter:
There’s a total of six different touch targets in the iOS 15
beta 4 tab bar in Safari.
These exclude the ability to long-press the tab bar, swipe across
it to change tabs, and swipe it up to open the Tabs view.
I’m … starting to think a single, small toolbar just won’t do. 😬
I responded that there are actually nine tap targets in the new toolbar in beta 4 — Viticci didn’t count the left / right edges that can be tapped like buttons to switch to the previous / next tabs. That’s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar. (My tweet says eight, but there are two separate tappable areas to bring up the URL address bar, one on each side of the minuscule reload button.)
Apple’s own example in the HIG of a toolbar that’s too crowded has … nine items.
Curtis Herbert:
I really do appreciate the experimentation, but the new Safari
feels like something I’d take to the UI Design Labs at WWDC and
they’d push me to use native controls that users expect and
already know, have better tap targets, and stop cramming too many
things in a small space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On iPhone:
The Share button is back in the toolbar, replacing the “···” don’t-call-it-a-hamburger-button. But there’s an awful lot of non-sharing stuff crammed into the Share menu — the ᴀA menu items from the current version of Safari (text size, Reader mode, disabling content blockers temporarily, etc.) are all in “Share” now. It’s better than the “···” menu in betas 1–3, but really, this is more like changing the “···” glyph to the Share glyph. It’s still two menus’ worth of features stuffed into one monolithic menu.


The Reload button is back. But it’s bizarrely tiny — way smaller than the minimum recommended tap target size of 44 x 44 points. And it shares space with the newly restored Reader mode button. When you load a page, if Reader mode is available, the Reader mode button shows briefly (maybe for 1–2 seconds?) along with the text “Reader Available” under the website’s domain name. But then the “Reader Available” label fades out and the Reader mode button turns into the Reload button. To enable Reader mode at this point, you either need to long-press the URL domain name to bring up a shortcut menu, or tap the — you guessed it — Share button, which has its own “Reader” item near the top.


Bookmarks are supposed to be easier to access, but I think most users accustomed to previous versions of Mobile Safari — which heretofore has always had a bookmarks button right in the main toolbar — are going to struggle to find them.



Apple is clearly trying to address the numerous complaints about the Safari 15 design for iPhone, but beta 4 feels like they’ve decided that the solution to finding themselves in a hole is to dig faster.

A Wall Street Journal investigation found that TikTok only needs
one important piece of information to figure out what you want:
the amount of time you linger over a piece of content. Every
second you hesitate or rewatch, the app is tracking you.
Not surprising it works this way, but creepy nonetheless. Update: I’ve long suspected that Instagram does something similar, with regard to its often uncanny “Hey, I was just looking at pictures of those…” ads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's earnings call for the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked how Apple decides what components to purchase and what components to develop, and Cook said that Apple asks if it can be done better. 




We ask ourselves if we can do something better. If we can deliver a better product. If we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we can do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we have an ability to do something better and therefore make a better product for the user. 
Cook went on to explain that the M1 chip is a great example of that. "We have the ability within our silicon team to make a product that's appreciably better than what we could buy," he said. 



Response to the ‌M1‌ chip has been "unbelievable," and has been powering Mac and iPad sales that are constrained. "That's how we look at that and whether we should enter a market or not," said Cook.



The ‌M1‌ chip has allowed Apple to cut ties with Intel, and Apple is no longer reliant on Intel technology or Intel release timelines. In the future, Apple is also planning to come out with its own modem chips, reducing its reliance on Qualcomm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple experienced "strong double digit growth" in the number of iPhone users who were upgrading an older device or swapping to an ‌iPhone‌ from an Android device, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during today's earnings call covering the third fiscal quarter of 2021. 





Cook said that it was the largest upgrade quarter for Q3 ever, and that the iPhone 12 upgrade cycle on the whole was "very strong." Sales of the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max were "particularly strong."



Going forward, Cook said that Apple feels "really good" about the future of the ‌iPhone‌ because 5G penetration remains "very low" and there's a lot of opportunity for sales growth in the 5G market. "We're in the very early innings of 5G," Cook said. "There are only a couple countries that are in the double digits."



The high number of new ‌iPhone‌ users and ‌iPhone‌ users upgrading to new models drove record sales momentum, with the ‌iPhone‌ ultimately bringing in $39.6 billion during the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's earnings call covering the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple CFO Luca Maesteri said that Apple is expecting supply constraints to affect the iPhone and the iPad in the coming quarter.





"The supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher in the September quarter," said Maestri. The constraints will impact ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ sales in particular.



It is not clear if these predicted supply constraints will affect the iPhone 13 models that are expected to launch in September.



Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked whether the supply constraints will continue into the holiday quarter, but Cook said that he doesn't want to predict that. "We're going to take it one quarter at a time," he said. "We will do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt." Cook went on to say that the constraints that Apple is seeing are the same constraints that are impacting other companies as well.
The majority of the constraints are of the variety that others are seeing. I would classify it as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.
Cook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.

According to Apple's latest earnings report for the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple's Mac category brought in $8.8 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. 





Sales were just a bit down from the second fiscal quarter of 2021, when Apple's Macs brought in $9.1 billion in revenue. iPad revenue was at $7.4 billion, up from $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter and again, just barely trailing Apple's second quarter earnings results. 



According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, while the Mac set a new June quarter revenue record. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the last four quarters have been the Mac's best four quarters ever. 



The earnings report covers sales of the M1 Mac and ‌iPad‌ machines, including the ‌M1‌ 24-inch iMac and the ‌M1‌ iPad Pro models that were released earlier this year.

Do I really want to re-buy F1 2020 cosmetics? No. Would I? Yeah.
 Let me preface this petty complaint by saying that I have about 12 hours of on-track time in F1 2021’s career mode alone, about two weeks after the game launched. I adore this game, and it will devour hundreds of my waking hours over the next year. But it’s for that reason I’m raising this stink: The customization unlocks and options, so far, are weak. Unacceptably weak.
The first eight-week season of the game’s Podium Pass offers just five vehicle liveries — and the colors cannot be altered for two of them, including an “epic” all-black livery called Shado…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vox, Emily Stewart writes about the shortcomings of the, er, system we’ve developed here in America of outsourcing public needs to private industry: Corporations aren’t going to save America.
Across various segments of American life, the private sector has begun to take on tasks big and small that one might think should be tackled by the public sector. Domino’s filled in potholes. Dawn’s dish soap saved ducks. American Express pitched in on historic preservation. Walmart started selling low-priced insulin. A slew of companies help workers pay for school. Much of America’s health care system is still handled through private insurers and your job. As people lose faith in government to act on sweeping issues such as climate change and guns, they’re increasingly looking to corporate America and asking whether there’s something they can do about it. If Congress won’t tackle gun violence, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods can try.
It’s not a bad thing for brands and companies to try to make the world better. Starting a business often involves identifying a problem to solve, and it’s much better for companies to help than to do harm. Corporate social responsibility is fine. There are, however, limits.
“Of course we want businesses to be responsible,” said Suzanne Kahn, managing director of research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. But she emphasized that this does not constitute a plan for how to organize society. “Private companies don’t, can’t, or won’t plan with the same values that we demand and expect the government to.”

Let’s check in with the new additions. 
 That’s a wrap on the draft, folks! It’s been a busy weekend, so it’s time that we take a few moments to recap, talk a bit about the new additions, 
What they lost
The Flyers, of course, traded away their first round pick in the deal that brought Rasmus Ristolainen to Philly. And we’re not here to re-litigate whether this was too steep a price to pay, but we’re just here to acknowledge that the Flyers are already at something of a disadvantage when it comes to grading this draft, as they weren’t able to add as much dynamic talent through the top of this draft as they’ve been able to in the past. So there’s that. 
Who they added

So Nissan teamed up with sound designers at Bandai Namco, the gaming company known for Pac-Man and Tekken, to replace those warning noises with something more musical.

I had a car once that beeped really sharply and loudly whenever the temperature dropped to 37°F as a warning for potential slippery roads and it scared the shit out of me every time. As someone who is sensitive to sound, I applaud efforts like these to make non-emergency sounds less jarring. (via rob walker (again))

Citing a Chinese supplier, the site says that the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ will continue to feature a 10.9-inch display and a Touch ID button on the side, but it will gain a dual-lens camera system with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.



A LiDAR Scanner is also a possibility for the ‌iPad Air‌, though it is not guaranteed and the supplier did not know for sure. Additional features include a four speaker audio system and a 5G mmWave chip.



Mac Otakara expects the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ to feature an A15 chip, and while today's rumor includes no detail on a release date, prior information has suggested an early 2022 launch.

With changes to the top six and defense, how will the depth forward group look in October? 
 So far this offseason, Flyers General Manager Chuck Fletcher has ensured that the team we will see at the start of the 2021-22 season will look vastly different to the one that left us disappointed in 2020-21. By trading for Ryan Ellis, Rasmus Ristolainen, and Cam Atkinson, Fletcher not only brings in new key pieces to the squad (as much as Ristolainen may be lamented, he is “key” in that they gave up a first round pick for him and he could seriously help or hinder the team), but clearly is attempting to change the sentiment in the dressing room. All three players are considered leaders, and based on Fletcher’s comments, that was something he felt the te…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest beta update of macOS Monterey, released to developers today, has brought Live Text functionality to Intel-based Mac computers, removing the requirement for users to use an M1 Apple silicon Mac to utilize the feature, according to Rene Ritchie.





Live Text, included in the forthcoming ‌macOS Monterey‌, iOS 15, and iPadOS 15 updates, allows users to interact with text within images, such as phone numbers, addresses, and more. With Live Text, text inside images also becomes selectable, allowing users to cut and copy the text into apps. 



Apple at first stated that an ‌M1‌ Apple silicon Mac is a requirement for Live Text on ‌macOS Monterey‌, but with the latest beta, it's been expanded to Intel-based Mac computers.




macOS Monterey Beta 4 includes Live Text for Intel Macs 🎉
Sounds like Apple prioritized it based on demand, but it was made much easier by the lack of real-time requirements for a camera system

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fourth beta of iPadOS 15 that was released today introduces tweaks to Safari, with the Safari layout now mirroring the updated layout that was introduced in macOS Monterey Beta 3.




The new Safari design in iPadOS 15 beta 4


Prior to this beta, Safari on iPad was similar to Safari on iOS with no dedicated tab bar, but after the update, Apple has added a dedicated tab bar that's activated by default, which is the same layout that's now used in macOS Monterey.




The original Safari design in ‌iPadOS 15‌ beta 3


While the separate tab bar is enabled automatically when updating, in the Safari section of Settings, there is an option to toggle on the original compact tab bar that merged everything together.



Apple in iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌ introduced a compact and unified Safari design that did away with the dedicated URL and search interface, instead letting any individual tab be used for navigation input.





This design has not been popular with users, which has led to Apple making some changes during the beta testing period. As of now, Safari on iPadOS mirrors Safari on ‌macOS Monterey‌, though additional design tweaks could come in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced two games that are coming soon to Apple Arcade, including the classic racing game "Asphalt 8: Airborne" from Gameloft and a new Zelda-inspired roleplaying game "Baldo" from Italian game studio NAPS team.



Originally released on the App Store in 2013, "Asphalt 8: Airborne" is coming to Apple Arcade, but no specific release date has been announced. The popular racing game features more than 240 real cars to select from automakers and brands such as Ferrari, Ducati, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti, Mercedes, Audi, Ford, and Chevrolet.





"Baldo" is described as an action-adventure roleplaying game with puzzles, exploration, and combat, all set in a hand-drawn open world. Players will embark on a journey into a magical land full of mysteries to discover as they complete the main story quest and many side quests. The game will be available on Apple Arcade starting Friday, August 27.





Another racing game "Detonation Racing" launches on Apple Arcade this Friday, with players having to navigate an environment rigged to blow up, collapse, and burst into flames at the least convenient moments. The game hails from Electric Square, the creators of another popular racing game "Forza Street" and the "Hot Wheels id" racing system.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

The newest member of the Philadelphia Flyers, is, jacked up.
 It took me probably about 20 minutes after the trade that brought winger Cam Atkinson from the Columbus Blue Jackets to the Philadelphia Flyers for Jakub Voracek, for me to go “oh yeah, duh that makes sense.”
Almost an immediate thumb up in Chuck Fletcher’s direction, this straight one-for-one swap has cured a lot of things for the Flyers and is just bringing in a kind soul that will make us feel better when they lose 5-3 to the New Jersey Devils for some damn reason. Atkinson has been one of the Good Guys in Columbus and just seems like a pleasant dude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[William Gallagher, reporting for AppleInsider:
In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, investment firm JP
Morgan Chase’s China office has reported to its clients that Apple
intends to introduce a titanium alloy to the iPhone for the first
time. Apple has already used titanium in some Apple Watch models,
for the physical Apple Card, and at times for the PowerBook.
Titanium’s toughness, though, is only achieved when it used as
part of a titanium alloy with other metals. Titanium is also prone
to smudges from fingerprints, and its finish can be unattractive.
Apple is therefore certain to be using an alloy, and it presumably
addresses these issues.
I hope this is true. Stainless steel is just too heavy; titanium would be a much nicer premium upgrade over aluminum. The titanium Apple Watch models are great, especially the Space Black model with a highly scratch-resistant DLC finish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al Jazeera:
The first person charged under Hong Kong’s national security law
has been found guilty of “terrorism” and “inciting secession”, in
a landmark case with long-term implications for how the
legislation reshapes the city’s common law traditions.
Former waiter Tong Ying-kit, 24, was accused of driving his
motorcycle in July last year into three riot police officers while
carrying a flag with the protest slogan: “Liberate Hong Kong,
revolution of our times”, which prosecutors said was secessionist.
An alternative charge of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily
harm was not considered in Tuesday’s widely anticipated ruling,
much of which has hinged on the interpretation of the slogan. […]
The ruling imposes new limits on free speech in the former British
colony. Pro-democracy activists and human rights groups have also
criticised the decision to deny Tong bail and a jury trial, which
have been key features of Hong Kong’s rule of law.
This is utterly unsurprising, but crushing nonetheless.

Explaining the summer’s indie darling
 There are few games like Cruelty Squad. It’s a brilliant entry into the immersive sim genre that critiques capitalism and the military-industrial complex. It’s also — and there’s no polite way to say this — a complete assault on the senses. The game is ugly, loud, and difficult. Playing Cruelty Squad can feel a lot like trying to eat a coconut with your bare hands. Yeah, there’s very clearly some good stuff in there, but for now I’m gnawing on this weird, hairy shell and starving.
All you have to do is look at the game to understand my trepidation. Everything is painted in bright, jarring colors. The menu text looks like it was scrawled in MS Paint with someone’s non-dominant hand. Cruelty Squad places its warped …]]></summary>

Brian Elliott is leaving Philadelphia, so here are some new guys to consider.
 The Philadelphia Flyers were killed by their goaltending last year and it’s no secret that the expectation is for Carter Hart to return to some faint picture of his former, younger All-Star self. But everybody needs some help along the way and with elder statesman Brian Elliott heading into free agency — and maybe retirement — the Flyers are in need of a new top-level backup.
There are still rumors that they might get that goaltender via trade and Braden Holtby is the latest unfortunate netminder to be linked to this team, but trading for the former elite goaltender is a risky one with a sizeable cap hit. So why not just start from scratch and sign one t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2001, performance art group Improv Everywhere have been staging events in public, aiming to “surprise and delight random strangers through positive pranks”. Their latest endeavor takes place in NYC, perhaps the best place on Earth for exposing random strangers to positive pranks. A man in an orange vest places a “Stand Here for Dance Party” sign on the ground and then walks away. A brave soul steps onto the sign and, well, you might guess what happens next.
I found this via Rob Walker’s newsletter about his book, The Art of Noticing. I love what he wrote about it:
Now that you’ve seen it, you know that once someone did stand on the decal, a squad of Improv Everywhere operatives, with boom boxes and impressive dance moves, converted the public space into (as promised) an open-air dance party. Very fun.
But here’s what makes this work: Not just the planning and the expert performers and the slick choreography and the clever subversion of social-distance design. None of that matters unless somebody stands on the decal. What activates this entire operation is curiosity.


He continues, describing the woman who gets the party started:
This woman is my hero! I love everything about her, her body language, her openness, the thrilling sense she radiates that anything could happen and she’s up for it. And if you’ve watched the video, you know that she in fact unleashed an experience that she (and many strangers nearby) will never forget.
What’s not in the video, but we know is true, is some huge majority of people not even noticing, or actively ignoring, the invitation to an impromptu, on-the-spot dance party. As always, attention is the first step.


Curiosity. Attention. There are those words again, the universe trying to tell me something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers are rethinking plans to use the Apple Watch in studies after finding inconsistencies in the data gathered by the device (via The Verge).





Inconsistencies in the Apple Watch's heart rate variability data are reportedly caused by Apple tweaking the device's algorithms, meaning that data from the same time period can change without warning. Associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the Beiwe data platform, J.P. Onnela, told The Verge:
These algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they're not transparent. So it's impossible to know what's in them.




Research fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital exported the heart rate data from Apple Watches for the same period of time, but several months apart. The data should have been identical, but since it is filtered through an algorithm prior to export it was drastically different.



Apple changes its algorithms regularly and without warning, so exporting the same data at different times may use different algorithms. Beyond heart rate variability, researchers looking into sleep tracking have experienced similar problems with changes to algorithms.



This mostly precludes commercial devices from being used by researchers, resulting in the need for devices specifically designed to collect data for scientific studies. While this is adequate for some studies, it heavily constrains research into the medical value of commercially available products for users. Some researchers say that Apple should publicize the changes it makes to algorithms or make the Apple Watch's raw data available.

The Flyers acquired Voracek in 2011 as part of a locker room change and was traded 10 years later in another roster shakeup.
 On June 23rd, 2011, the Flyers made a pair of trades that changed the direction of the franchise. They shipped out Mike Richards and Jeff Carter in two separate deals and got back a handful of young players. Among them was Jakub Voracek from Columbus.
Carter was sent to Columbus by the Flyers but then reunited with Richards in Los Angeles via trade. There, they went on to win two Stanley Cups, including one with Ron Hextall as Kings Vice President and Assistant General Manager. A decade later, Hextall traded for an aging Jeff Carter at the trade deadline while Voracek got traded in the offseason.

Knight searches for the right words. “I don’t want to sound
negative,” he says. Knight explains some of Kidd’s methods, such
as how Kidd would embarrass the culprit of an error by making
everyone but that person run sprints for his mistake. “He just had
his way of getting his point across,” Knight says.
Little things were made to be a big deal: At one point center Thon
Maker didn’t have an iPhone, messing up the team’s blue-bubble
iPhone group chat. Kidd was upset about it and made the team run
because Kidd felt that Maker not getting an iPhone was an example
of the team not being united.
So now we know there’s a basketball court inside Apple’s walled garden.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buzz Andersen, in a guest post for Why Is This Interesting:
Eventually, a Russian artist and Twitter user named Gregory
Khodyrev realized what was going on: someone at Russia’s
state Internet censor, Roscomnadzor, had attempted to block the
Internet domain “t.co” (used by Twitter’s URL shortener), but had
instead managed to cut off access to any domain containing the
text pattern “t.co.” This meant that sites such as
“microsoft.com,” “reddit.com,” and even Russia’s own state media
outlet “rt.com” were rendered suddenly inaccessible.
Readers with a modicum of technical knowledge may already have an
inkling of what likely happened here: some hapless censor,
attempting to curb Twitter’s political influence, installed a
URL pattern matching rule on Russia’s national firewall that
turned out to have been just a tad overzealous. The rule in
question was almost certainly expressed using a notoriously
abstruse notation called a “regular expression.”

The Oculus iPhone app has code that would allow workouts completed with the Oculus headset to be recorded in the Health app like other workout data. The Oculus app would be able to report health-related metrics like exercise minutes and number of calories burned.



Third-party apps have long been able to provide workout and fitness data that's aggregated in the Health app using the dedicated HealthKit API.



As Bloomberg points out, the code's presence in the Oculus app does not mean the feature will actually see a launch.

From the highs to the lows, it’s more Musou
 I’ve been a fan and player of Musou games (or “Warriors games,” if you’re a dubs instead of subs person) since they were brand-spanking new — 20 years at this point. I’ve been with them from 2000’s Dynasty Warriors 2, the very first, right up to now. After a week and a half with Samurai Warriors 5, I have a confession to make:
I don’t know how to talk to people about Musou games anymore.
When Polygon approached me about writing this piece, the original idea was that I would be writing a review of Samurai Warriors 5, from a Musou lifer’s perspective. So, as I played it, that’s the mindset I was in: Looking at gameplay, graphics, presentation elements, how it “felt.” I could definitely write that story if I wanted to.  …]]></summary>

iOS 14.6 was a major update that added Apple Watch iPhone unlocking, Apple Maps accident crowdsourcing, Apple Card Family sharing, AirTag improvements, and more.



iOS 14.7, the update that replaces iOS 14.6, added MagSafe Battery Pack support and introduced numerous bug fixes. Apple today also released iOS 14.7.1, a smaller update that includes a critical security fix and a fix for a bug that could prevent Touch ID iPhones from unlocking a connected Apple Watch.

Philadelphia has prepped some RFAs for future deals.
 Less than 48 hours before the gates of free agency opens and the NHL turns into a clutch-and-grab league again with available players, the Philadelphia Flyers have qualified goaltender Carter Hart, defenseman Travis Sanheim, and forwards Connor Bunnaman and David Kase.
We have extended qualifying offers to the following four players:
 • Connor Bunnaman
• Carter Hart
• David Kase
• Travis Sanheim pic.twitter.com/eZuFkIe1yo
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 26, 2021



Essentially just a formality, these qualifying offers will keep these players rights in Philadelphia and won’t just let them walk into unrestricted free agency. In recent memory, only Nolan Patrick accepted his qualifying offer as a new, one-year contract for the Flyers that is at 105 percent at the player’s most recent cap hit.
The only player the Flyers did not send a qualifying offer to was forward Pascal Laberge, a former second-round pick back in 2016 that hasn’t even amassed 100 games in Lehigh Valley.
Hart and Sanheim were the obvious choices and will be the two guaranteed current restricted free agents that will be in the Flyers’ lineup at the start of next season, but in Bunnaman and Kase, there are some very solid depth options for the Flyers that will no doubt be cheap short-term deals.
At least there aren’t any headache-inducing contract negotiations this year.]]></summary>

As the saying goes, fate has dealt me one from the bottom of the deck, and I am now condemned to confront the question that has plagued me for years: How does a person spend what he knows are his final months of life?
Atop the list of things I’ll miss are the smiles and hugs every morning from my beautiful wife, Geraldine, the greatest blessing of my life. I hate the notion of an eternity without hearing laughter from my three children. And what about my 40 rose bushes? Who will nurture them? I cannot imagine an afterlife without the red of my America roses or the aroma of my yellow Julia Childs.
We told each of the three children individually. John Patrick put his face in his hands, racked with sobs. After hanging up the telephone, Jennifer doubled over and wept until her dog, Rosie, approached to lick away the tears but not the melancholy. Faith explained over the telephone that, if I could see her, she was weeping and wondering how she could get along without her dad. Now, she is on the Internet every day, snorkeling for new research, new strategies, new medications. My wife cries every morning, then rolls up her sleeves and handles all doctor appointments and medication. Without her… I cannot imagine.

See Unreal Engine 5 running on Xbox Series X
 Gears of War developer The Coalition showed off what the studio — and the Xbox Series X — is capable of with Epic Games’ new Unreal Engine. In a pair of demos, which The Coalition made clear “do not represent a game product,” we get a peek at ultra-realistic character rendering and two major new features of Unreal Engine 5: Lumen and Nanite.
The character rendering demo shows a human male character rendered in extreme detail: His body is composed of 130,000 triangles, with another 31,000 dedicated to his face alone. His hair, beard, and eyebrows eat up another 3.5 million.
In another demo, The Coalition showcases the real-time lighting and reflection technology, called Lumen, in Unreal Engine 5, and Nanite, “which allows for unlimited triangle budget.” Epic Games announced those UE5 features in May 2020, as part of a showcase of the game engine running on PlayStation 5 hardware, but here’s another sun-baked, particle-rich, and glowing-mirrored-obelisk look at the graphics tech in action:


The Coalition announced in May that it was winding down development on Gears of War 5, and shifting to new, unannounced projects using Unreal Engine 5. The Coalition said it will be developing with UE5 “for multiple new projects in the coming years.”
Epic announced Unreal Engine 5 last year, and made the technology available in preview form in early 2021. A full release is slated for late 2021. Unreal Engine 5 will be available for both current-generation and last-generation consoles, as well as Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows PC. UE5 is being developed with forward compatibility in mind, Epic says, letting developers create games in Unreal Engine 4 and move them to the next-generation engine later.
For a full look at The Coalition’s Unreal Engine 5 tech demos, check out the developer’s hourlong GDC 2021 presentation on YouTube.]]></summary>

 Forza Horizon 5 developer Playground Games is promising the largest map to date in the 9-year-old open-world racing series. That gives Playground room to render 11 different biomes, which the game’s designers detailed on Xbox Wire on Monday afternoon.
The locations range from the streets of Guanajuato City (a city of about 200,000 in central Mexico) to a cactus desert filled with the tall saguaros for which the northwest state of Sonora is well known. “Each of the 11 unique biomes will transition through the seasons differently,” Xbox Wire said, referencing the changing-seasons feature introduced in 2018’s Forza Horizon 4, set in the United Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Lee, on Twitter:
I’ve been fascinated to watch the reaction to Safari in iOS 15 because in 2016-2017, I worked on a similar redesign for mobile Chrome that we never launched. Finally decided to tell a bit of that story here.
His story:
I created the original concept and pitch for Chrome Home in 2016. It was based off two insights:
Phones were growing in size, and we had opportunity to innovate in creating a gestural, spatial interface that would still be usable with one hand.


Mobile Chrome was also growing in features — but because its minimalist interface kept everything behind a “three dot” menu, these features were underutilized and hard to access.



The idea caught traction internally, eventually becoming a Chrome org priority. […]
We heard a mixture of reactions. The feature gained a cult following among the tech community, but for many mainstream users, the change felt disorienting. Chrome serves billions of users around the globe with varying tech literacy. Over the course of many iterations, I became increasingly convinced that launching Chrome Home would not serve all our users well.
So just as I strongly as I had pitched the original concept, I advocated for us to stop the launch — which took not a small amount of debate.
Really curious to see what the next betas of Safari look like on iOS and iPadOS. I spent all weekend with my spare phone running iOS 15 b3 and the new Safari design is not growing on me, at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sixth-generation iPad mini that's in the works will have an 8.3-inch display, according to display analyst Ross Young. That will be larger than the current 7.9-inch display, with the larger size due to the removal of the Home button and a narrower bezel design.





Rumors about the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 have been picking up in recent weeks ahead of its prospective launch this fall.



Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ could measure in at 8.5 to 9 inches, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ will have a larger display with slimmed down bezels.




Grew from 7.9" due to narrower bezels and removal of Home button.
— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) July 26, 2021
 


There was mixed information on whether the new ‌iPad mini‌ would have a Home button, but rumors now appear to be coalescing around an iPad Air 4-like design with no Home button and either Face ID or a Touch ID power button.



The new ‌iPad mini‌ could include either an A14 chip or an A15 chip, plus it is expected to have a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, which would bring Apple closer to dropping Lightning on the iPad lineup.



DigiTimes recently suggested the new ‌iPad mini‌ would have a mini-LED display, but a report from Young last week disputed that information and said the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will have a standard display rather than a mini-LED display.

Apple says that an application may have been able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges due to a memory corruption issue. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," reads the document.



The vulnerability has been addressed with improved memory handling, and because this is a security issue that may have affected some users, all iPhone and iPad users should update to iOS 14.7.1 and iPadOS 14.7.1 as soon as possible. The same vulnerability has also been addressed in the macOS Big Sur 11.5.1 update.



The iOS 14.7.1 update also fixes a bug that could prevent Touch ID iPhones from unlocking an Apple Watch.

What if you played an ignorant guy who was actually curious? When someone used a big word like “vernacular,” he didn’t act like he knew it, but just stops the meeting like, “Question, what does that mean?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today updated its Apple at Work website with a new section dedicated to the Mac, which offers up 11 reasons why "Mac means business."





On the webpage, Apple highlights the M1 chip as the number one reason why business users should choose a Mac, offering up an ‌M1‌ overview [PDF] that explains the benefits of the ‌M1‌ chip. The information isn't new, but it does provide a look at all of Apple's ‌M1‌ marketing materials.



The ‌M1‌, Apple explains, offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, 50 percent faster web app responsiveness, and 2x longer battery life when video conferencing on Zoom.
When compared with the latest model of the best-selling PC notebook purchased by businesses in its price range, MacBook Air with M1 offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, up to 50% faster web application responsiveness, up to 2x faster browser graphics performance and up to 2x longer battery life when video conferencing with Zoom on a single charge.
Apple also highlights the MacBook Air's long battery life, device security, and integration with iPhone as reasons why the Mac is superior to PCs.



Businesses can set up Macs from anywhere with zero-touch deployment, and Macs are intuitive to use and easy to manage with features like Migration Assistant so companies won't need to rely as much on IT support staff. Apple cites a study that says the Mac is less expensive to run because it needs fewer support tickets and less software, saving businesses up to $843 over a three-year period.



According to Apple, 84 percent of the "world's top innovators" like Salesforce, SAP, and Target run Macs at scale, and business apps "run beautifully" on the Mac. Apple's site aims to convince businesses that employees should be given the "power to work the way they want" using the "tools they love" to inspire them to do better work.

The exclusive livestream saw 3.3 million viewers tune in, which TMZ says is a new ‌Apple Music‌ record. This is apparently a record that "no artist has ever come near."
Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... Ye's album event this past week at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta broke the Apple Music Global Livestream record ... with 3.3 million viewers who tuned in on their screens.
The prior record was 1.8 million viewers for a Verzuz battle between Gucci Mane and Jeezy that was livestreamed last year.



Apple streamed the album's debut from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, and the event was highlighted in a Beats Studio Buds ad that aired during the NBA finals.



Kanye West's "Donda" album has not yet been released, but it is expected to come out on August 6. The livestream of the album's debut is expected to be available on ‌Apple Music‌ after the album drops.

Last month, Chris Reynolds, a senior executive who oversees government affairs for the company, traveled to Washington for closed-door meetings with congressional staff members and outlined Toyota’s opposition to an aggressive transition to all-electric cars. He argued that gas-electric hybrids like the Prius and hydrogen-powered cars should play a bigger role, according to four people familiar with the talks.
Behind that position is a business quandary: Even as other automakers have embraced electric cars, Toyota bet its future on the development of hydrogen fuel cells — a costlier technology that has fallen far behind electric batteries — with greater use of hybrids in the near term. That means a rapid shift from gasoline to electric on the roads could be devastating for the company’s market share and bottom line.
This sounds like a once-great company that has lost its way. The real Toyota would lead the way to the future.

Trailer shows off Seer and the new Rampage gun
 World’s Edge is getting a massive makeover in Apex Legends’ newest season. Respawn Entertainment released a trailer on Monday to show off the newly destroyed version of the map along with some of the other features of the Apex Legends season 10: Emergence, including Seer, the game’s new Legend, and the new Rampage weapon.
World’s Edge was already filled with the lava and all sorts of other hazards, but the new “decimated” version of the map seems to make it more treacherous than ever. Lava is expanding into new parts of the map, as buildings and terrain are destroyed by some kind of calamity. In one of the earlier trailers, there’s even an avalanche of some kind for players to outrun. The trailer only gives quick glimpses of areas of the map, but it seems like large portions will be totally changed when the new season is released. 
The new map update isn’t the only change that Respawn is bringing with season 10 either. Seer already seems like one of the game’s most exciting Legends and he gets another spotlight in this trailer. We see him shooting down enemies as well as tracking them with his various nanotech abilities, including his Ultimate, which places a dome over a small area of the map and tracks anyone moving quickly inside. 
The Emergence update will also include a new weapon called Rampage, which seems to be a slow-firing but very powerful rifle. Of course, there will also be a battle pass to go along with the new season that includes character and weapon skins for players to unlock as they play. 
Apex Legends season 10 and all of its additions are set to go live on Aug. 3.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this collaboration between musician and filmmaker John Boswell (aka melodysheep) and the sound podcast Twenty Thousand Hertz, we get to listen to some of the actual and theoretical sounds of space, from what the Sun would sound like if space weren’t a vacuum (we’d hear it as loud as a jackhammer on Earth) to the sound of the Universe just after the Big Bang to thunder in the thick atmosphere of Venus to dreamlike piano music on Mars.
Floating in the silent void of space are trillions of islands of sound, each with their own sonic flavor — some eerily familiar, some wildly different than Earth’s. And even space itself was once brimming with sound. 
This short film takes you on a journey back in time and to the edge of our solar system and beyond, to discover what other worlds of sound are lurking beyond Earth’s atmosphere. You won’t believe your ears :)


This is really well done, which isn’t surprising considering Boswell did the excellent Timelapse of the Future video a few years back. The soundtrack to The Sounds of Space video is available on Bandcamp. (via aeon)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Mac Pro that's coming in 2022 is set to use Intel's Ice Lake Xeon W-3300 workstation chips, according to an Intel leaker that WCCFtech says has offered reliable information on Intel Xeon chips in the past.





Intel's W-3300 Ice Lake CPUs are set to launch in the near future, and there have already been signs of new Ice Lake SP processors in the Xcode 13 beta. Intel has said that these chips offer "advanced performance, security, efficiency, and built-in AI acceleration to handle IoT workloads and more powerful AI."




Apple’s MacPro 2022 seems to use Intel’s Xeon-W 33xx series processors... 
(LGA4189 iceLake-SP)
— 结城安穗-YuuKi_AnS (@yuuki_ans) July 26, 2021
 


Ice Lake chips for the ‌Mac Pro‌ would offer up to 38 cores and 76 threads, with the Xeon W-3775 positioned as Intel's top chip in the lineup. This top of the line chip features 57MB of cache and a 4.0GHz clock speed.



While Apple is transitioning its Mac lineup to Apple silicon and is developing a version of the ‌Mac Pro‌ that will run an Apple silicon chip, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that Apple will also update the Intel Mac Pro.



Apple is working on a smaller ‌Mac Pro‌ that's about half the size of the original and that is expected to include an Apple silicon chip, but alongside it, the company is also developing a new version of the current ‌Mac Pro‌.



The Intel-based ‌Mac Pro‌ that's in the works with Intel's W-3300 Ice Lake chips could be one of the last Intel Macs that Apple will develop. Apple has already begun transitioning the iMac, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air lines to Apple silicon.

The video walks through using the Ultra Wide camera for unique perspectives and it demonstrates different lighting effects that can be used to make a cinematic feel.



There's a technique on a DIY crane shot captured by dropping an ‌iPhone‌ onto a soft surface, and a supernatural effect done with a camping headlamp and a bike wheel.



Apple regularly shares Shot on ‌iPhone‌ videos, and for the last several months, has been doing "Everyday Experiments" videos that often show behind the scenes techniques much like today's film techniques video.

The vehicles have also returned to Belgium to survey additional regions after focusing on the Brussels area last year.

Apple will use the data collected to improve its Maps app and expand its Look Around feature, which is currently limited to parts of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Japan. Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around is similar to Google's Street View, providing 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned.



Where available, Look Around can be accessed by tapping the binoculars icon in the top-right corner of the Maps app. Look Around also appears in the search results for a supported city, below the Flyover and Directions buttons.



Apple Maps vehicles began surveying efforts in 2015, collecting data in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Singapore, Israel, and select other countries and territories. 



On its website, Apple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting surveys. For example, Apple blurs out faces and license plates in street-level imagery made available through Look Around.

Newcomers might get lost in Square Enix’s follow-up to a 14-year-old game
 What do the games in a series or genre owe to each other? How do they inform and build on each other? After playing Neo: The World Ends with You, a reboot-cum-sequel to a critically-acclaimed 14-year-old Nintendo DS game, this question sits at the forefront for me. Especially since, at least according to the series’ creative producer Tetsuya Nomura, Neo: TWEWY isn’t actually a sequel to its video game predecessor.
Back in April, Funimation began simulcasting a The World Ends with You anime season, 12 episodes designed to tell the first game’s story and eliminate the need to play the game itself entirely. Within the space of nearly five hours, viewers can get all caught up with the story …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://kottke.org/21/07/his-name-was-emmett-till"/>
        <updated>2021-07-26T14:35:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This piece by Wright Thompson on how the murder of Emmett Till has been remembered and forgotten is a difficult, compelling, and important read. The story centers around the still-little-known barn where Till was tortured and murdered by a group of several white men in 1955.
But the way Till’s name exists in the firmament of American history stands in opposition to the gaps in what we know about his killing. No one knows, for instance, how many people were involved. Most historians think at least seven were present. Only two were tried: half brothers J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Another half brother, Leslie Milam, was there that night too. He lived in an old white farmhouse a few dozen steps from the barn, next to where Jeff Andrews’s house now stands.
In 1955 an all-white, all-male jury, encouraged by the defense to do their duty as “Anglo-Saxons,” acquitted J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Because the defendants couldn’t be tried again, they got paid to make a confession to a national magazine — a heavily fictionalized account stage-managed by their lawyers — and Leslie Milam and his barn were written out of the story. Ask most people where Till died and they’ll say Money, Mississippi, the town where Till whistled at Bryant’s wife outside the family’s store. An Equal Justice Initiative monument in Montgomery says Money. Wikipedia does too. The Library of Congress website skips over the barn, which is just outside the town of Drew, about 45 minutes from the store.
I learned about the barn last year and have since made repeated visits, alone and with groups, once with members of Till’s family. Over and over, I drove from my home in the Mississippi hill country back into the gothic flatland where I was born. The barn’s existence conjures a complex set of reactions: It is a mourning bench for Black Americans, an unwelcome mirror for white Americans. It both repels and demands attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lamborghini is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Countach sports car with a new video series involving inspirational personalities, and the latest videos shared today feature Apple's former marketing chief Phil Schiller.





Schiller, who is now an Apple Fellow, said innovative products that stand the test of time have both great design and solve a problem.



"At Apple, we like to exist at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts, and I think that's a wonderful place to be," said Schiller. "It's not just enough to make something — you have to make it in a way that has meaning in people's lives."






In a companion Q&A video on Lamborghini's website, Schiller said the iPod is the project he is the most proud of. When asked if he prefers gas or electric vehicles, Schiller said that while he would always say combustion engines, he is "getting ready for electric" and he is excited to see what companies like Lamborghini can deliver in the space. Lamborghini recently announced plans to release its first fully-electric vehicle after 2025, and Apple has for years been rumored to be planning its own electric vehicle.



As an Apple Fellow, Schiller is responsible for leading the App Store and Apple Events, after helping guide Apple's products and marketing for 30 years. 



(Thanks, Benjamin Cartwright!)

The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services heard for-and-against arguments from Apple, Google, and others relating to whether Apple should open up access to its near-field communication (NFC) chip. Australia's big banks have also sought open access to the NFC chip on the iPhone in recent years. However, in a written response to the committee, Apple said it "provides banks with access to NFC functionality on Apple devices" through ‌Apple Pay‌, which is "available to all banks in Australia on fair and non-di…]]></summary>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *So kind of a big weekend, huh pals? Let’s start with the draft and work our way up, excitement-wise. The Flyers made some picks over the weekend, and if you missed them, here’s a full rundown: 
A Finnish winger was up first, with the 46th overall pick. [BSH]
Chuck went with a goalie with his next pick, number 78. [BSH]
 At 110th overall they went defense. Really rounding things out huh? [BSH]
Another defenseman, this time from California, with pick 158. [BSH]
And ANOTHER defenseman at 174! [BSH]
And finally, at 206th, a center. [BSH]
*That kid they took at 206 is a local boy! You love to see it. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of local boys, Brian Boucher’s kid was drafted! Yes, that’s correct, you are that old. [Inquirer]
*Full run down of the draft weekend’s winners and losers, if you’re interested. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Okay let’s get to the big stuff! The Flyers’ first pick was number 46 because they traded the 13th pick, and a bunch of other stuff, to the Buffalo Sabres for Rasmus Ristolainen. Charlie unpacks it all for you. [The Athletic] 
*Folks will probably like Risto, who says he’s excited to get here and be a “pain in the ass.” [NBC Sports Philly]
*After that bit of spiciness Chuck got even spicier, finally finding a place to send Jake Voracek. Back from whence he came, actually. [BSH]
*Charlie unpacks the Voracek trade as well, which honestly might end up being the biggest move of the summer. [The Athletic]
*And finally, the Ghost trade might have been the move made thus far that is the most... annoying? Frustrating? Whatever your feelings on it, it had to be done. And it’s good Chuck did it. [NBC Sports Philly]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple plans to bring Face ID to the Mac within the next "couple of years," respected Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman said today in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter.





In the newsletter, Gurman says that he believes Apple's ultimate goal is to shift all of its products to Face ID, including the lower-end iPhones such as the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which feature Touch ID. Gurman says ‌Touch ID‌ remains an important part of Apple's product lineup, especially for lower-end models, thanks to it being a "cheaper alternative" to Face ID while continuing to provide security to users.

But I expect that to eventually change. It won’t happen this year, but I’d bet Face ID on the Mac is coming within a couple of years. I expect all iPhones and iPads to transition to Face …]]></summary>

A center, at long last.
 That’s all, folks! The Flyers have made their final* selection of the 2021 Entry Draft and picked up center Owen McLaughlin. 
*unless they very quickly make another trade and add a second seventh round pick at the last minute to make me look liar. 
McLaughlin spent the bulk of his season playing at the U18 AAA level with Mount St. Charles Academy, where he put up a decidedly not too shabby 16 goals and 38 assists in 33 games played. 
He also had a brief run playing with the US NTDP at the end of the season, with four and seven games in that USHL/USDP split. He didn’t pick up any points in that span, but getting that opportunity in the first place is no small accomplishment. And between that and McLaughlin’s scoring numbers at the high school level, there’s a whole lot that’s interesting about his profile. And coming in the seventh round, it’s a really nice low risk pick with the potential for a high reward. 
We also cannot resist mentioning that he’s pretty close to a Philly local, hailing from Spring City, PA. 
Per Flyers AGM Brent Flahr, McLaughlin will be going to Sioux City of the USHL next season, but once he moves on to the NCAA level, he’s committed to play at Penn State, and should be a nice addition to their program there.]]></summary>

More and more defensemen!
 Another pick, another defenseman. The Flyers are on a roll here, and they’ve picked up a third defenseman in a row with their sixth round, 174th overall pick in Ethan Samson. 
A product of the Prince George Cougars of the WHL, Samson is a right shot defenseman with decent size (6’1”, 194 pounds). While the Flyers’ first two pickups of the day on defense brought a bit more of a dynamic offensive game, Samson falls more into the mold of a defensive-defenseman. He was able to get a bit of power play time this season on top of his even strength and penalty kill responsibilities, and was still able to bring a bit of scoring to the table, with 12 points in his 22 games played. So there is a bit of offensive upside there, but it’s really Samson’s defensive game that stands out. 
He has a good motor and brings a nice bit of physicality. He anticipates plays well and brings a good defensive awareness, and we see that working well both in the defensive zone and at the blue line, as he works on breaking up entries. But he also still skates and passes well, so there is still a good bit of dynamic skill to his game, it’s not as though he’s just a one trick defensive pony, if you will. 
And the pipeline fills out further at defense!]]></summary>

Another defenseman from California, you say?
 How are we holding up, Flyers fans? The draft is still happening, the picks are rolling in, and the Flyers have picked up another defenseman!
With their 158th overall pick, the Flyers have selected Ty Murchison from the US National Team Development Program. Murchison put up modest scoring numbers in his draft year, with three goals and two assists in 23 games played (USHL) and seven goals and eight assists in 48 games played (USDP). He brings good size (6’2”, 192 pounds), but could still stand to get a little stronger. And while there’s still some polishing that needs to go into his game, all told, there’s a lot to like. He’s a smooth skater, and strong passer, and can transition the puck well. He brings a quick shot that he can get through traffic well, and that’s made him particularly effective on the power play. His defensive game needs some polishing, but his instincts are generally good, and he’s able to make use of good stick work to break up plays. The fundamentals are good. 
And we have two fun facts!
Ty Murchison, just picked up by the Flyers is a converted inline player. Headed to Arizona State next season. Told us at the U18s that Aidan Hreschuk, picked by Carolina in the third round, was one of the players who helped him convert to ice.
— Chris Peters (@chrismpeters) July 24, 2021



He also joins the likes of Cam York and Jack St. Ivany in the group of Flyers defense prospects from California, which is pretty neat!
Murchison will kick off his collegiate career with an Arizona State University program that just seems to be on the rise.]]></summary>

And now a defenseman!
 The draft keeps on rolling, and the Flyers have just made their third pick. In the fourth round, with the 110th overall pick, the Flyers have selected defenseman Brian Zanetti.

Zanetti, a 6’2” left shot defenseman, spent this season playing with Lugano of the Swiss U20 league, and he was able to put up nine goals and 20 assists in 41 games played. He also captained Switzerland’s U18 team in this year’s tournament, where he also picked up two points in in eight games. 
A smooth skater and clean passer, Zanetti is a nice addition to the Flyers’ group of mobile, strong puck moving defensemen that they’re building up in the pipeline. Zanetti was supposed to play in Peterborough of the OHL this season, but with their season never getting rolling, he opted to stay in Switzerland. He did confirm to the media this afternoon that he plans to come over to play in Peterborough next season, though. 
Another fine pickup for the Flyers.]]></summary>

Another goalie enters the mix
 With their third round pick of the 2021 Draft, the Flyers have selected Belarusian goaltender Aleksei Kolosov.

Kolosov, who was passed over in last year’s draft, spent much of this season with Dinamo Minsk of the KHL. While his usage there was a bit limited, he posted solid results as a teenager playing in a professional league. He only played in nine games, but he posted a .911 save percentage in those games. 
Though not the biggest player in terms of what we normally see in goaltenders (Kolosov is listed at 6’1” and 187 pounds), his skillset is undeniably an intriguing one. Kolosov brings very good quickness, and also generally good positioning on top of that. He’s economic in his movements, angles well, and flexes quite solid rebound control. There’s a definite calmness to his play, both in his ability to maintain control of his movements when he does have to move quickly, but also in how he rarely seems to get rattled when the game may not be going his way. 
Certainly there’s still a good bit of work that needs to be done to clean up and develop his game, but the Flyers seem willing to give him the time to develop, and are hoping to add a nice bit of organizational depth and further bolster their goaltender prospect pipeline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:
Starting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads through a web app people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games. […]
“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”
There’s a lot to roll your eyes at in this brief statement, but the big one is the last clause, implying that Apple’s stance on cloud gaming has anything at all to do with pushing people to buy the “latest and most expensive devices”. Say what you want about Apple’s App Store policies, they go to great lengths to keep older devices relevant for as long as possible — including with their own library of Apple Arcade games.
Will be interesting to see if these web app games are actually good, and if so, actually become popular.

Trades abound!
 The Flyers’ busy summer continues, and as we’re just settling into day 2 of the draft, the Flyers dropped another trade on us, and it’s a big one. 
The Flyers have announced that they’ve traded Jake Voracek to the Columbis Blue Jackets in exchange for Cam Atkinson. *Bob McKenzie voice* the trade is one for one. 
Atkinson is coming off of a respectable (if not a little down) season, which saw him post 15 goals and 19 assists, for 34 points in 56 games on a struggling Blue Jackets team. 
Cam Atkinson (traded to Philadelphia) is a good 5v5 play-driver, a little underwhelming on the power-play, finishing not great. pic.twitter.com/nRD6TV6J6a
— Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) July 24, 2021



There are a few different areas of interesting trade-offs that come with this trade. The Flyers lose a bit of the scoring game that they had with Voracek, but they gain a stronger play driver. Atkinson and Voracek are the same age, and while Atkinson is signed for four more years (one more than Voracek), his cap hit is just $5.875 million, so the Flyers do free up $2.375 million in cap space. 
And, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t also mention in the locker room implications of this move. There has been talk for a while about the mix with this Flyers team, in the locker room, not being right somehow, and the core being in need of a shake-up. And, well, moving out one of the team’s longest tenured players certainly achieves just that. 
What’s more, Atkinson was part of the leadership group in Columbus, and while it may not be fair to assume that he’ll immediately step into a similar role in Philadelphia, he remains a new voice with that leadership experience, and that hardly seems like a bad thing. 
It’s been a busy offseason, to be sure, and next season’s new look Flyers are continuing to evolve.]]></summary>

With their first pick of the 2021 NHL Draft, Philadelphia got a high-scoring Finnish forward
 With the 46th pick of the 2021 NHL Draft, the Philadelphia Flyers selected Samu Tuomaala, a right winger playing for Kärpät in the Finnish Liiga.

— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 24, 2021



Due to the acquisition of Rasmus Ristolainen — no matter how you feel about it — the Flyers took the night off on Friday and are making their first pick in the second round. In Tuomaala they got a fairly flashy player that was ranked anywhere from the top-20 to the middle of the second round by several scouting services.

He spent most of the season in the U20 junior league but got a total of five games playing in the top Finnish division, among men — so at least he has that experience and will most likely stay up there for longer next season.

— Spoked Z (@SpokedZ) July 16, 2021



For their first pick, it’s certainly a high-ceiling of a pick that could potentially pan out as a solid middle-six winger that can contribute on the powerplay. Given the fact that the Flyers have really tried to nail down those offensive players, selecting either Bobby Brink or Tyson Foerster with their top picks in recent years, in Tuomaala they got a similar projection of a player.
He skates fast and shoots the puck a lot. That’s the simple notion of his game.]]></summary>

I got gud
 I don’t consider myself a gamer — I’m just someone who quite likes playing video games. Apart from a Game Boy in the 1990s, the first console I owned was a Nintendo Switch that I bought in early 2018 to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I finally got around to buying a PlayStation 4 in the latter part of the same year. So it’s no surprise that when I first announced to a few experienced gamer friends and colleagues that I was going to play Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, most of them suggested I try another game first, or maybe not bother playing it at all. 
For those who have never played it, 2019’s Sekiro is the downhill skiing of video games: it looks fairly easy and straightforward …]]></summary>

There may not be much Flyers talk tonight, but there’s a draft still happening.
 Well, if you were hoping for the Flyers to do something on draft day, you got your wish, technically: The Flyers dealt their first-round pick (along with another second-round pick and defenseman Robert Hagg) to Buffalo for defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen earlier today. We’ll have more thoughts on that move in the coming days, weeks, and (gulp) months.
In the meantime, though, that move does mean that tonight is probably going to be a pretty uneventful night for the Flyers. Probably. Chuck Fletcher did suggest during today’s media availability that he’s probably not going to have any more moves coming today, and the Flyers, of course, no longer have their pick tonight.
Still, there are things happening around the league, and tonight might just be a big night around the league. If you’re here (and not at our draft party!), feel free to use this space to discuss the picks and whatever else happens around the league.
NHL Draft, Night 1:
Start Time: 8:00 p.m .ET
How to Watch: ESPN2 and the ESPN App
Flyers’ Draft Picks:
No. 45 (Round 2)
No. 77 (Round 3)
No. 109 (Round 4)
No. 157 (Round 5)
No. 173 (Round 6)
No. 205 (Round 7)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's iOS 15 website lists "improved recognition for individuals" as one of the new Photos features, and in a machine learning blog post shared this week, Apple gave more information on what exactly that means.





Apple says that on-device machine learning improvements have led to significantly better person recognition. The iOS 15 ‌Photos‌ app is able to detect people in extreme poses, people wearing accessories, and people with occluded faces.



To do this, Apple uses a combination of face and upper body to match people whose faces are not visible. Apple's machine learning blog says that the new functionality improves the ‌Photos‌ experience by identifying people in situations where it was previously impossible.



Apple's blog post on recognizing people in photos through on-device machine learning goes into much greater detail on how Apple uses machine learning to identify people while still protecting user privacy, and it's well worth a read for those who are interested in the inner workings of ML features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in March, Hyper released its HyperJuice Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack for the iPhone 12 lineup, promising customers an easy way to wirelessly charge their devices on the go. At the time, there were relatively few options for portable MagSafe-compatible battery packs on the market. Now, though, thanks to Apple's recent release of its own MagSafe Battery Pack, there is a little more competition, and Hyper's battery pack stacks up as a worthy competitor. 





Design


One of the most eye-catching aspects of the battery pack is its size. Like Apple's ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, Hyper sells one battery pack for all iPhone 12 models, meaning the size must be unawkwardly big enough for the iPhone 12 Pro Max but remain small enough to fit on an iPhone 12 mini.

Philadelphia got a guy from Buffalo.
 Everyone knew the Philadelphia Flyers were going to be active trying to fill holes on the blue line, but no one knew how quickly.
During the first few hours of the weekend of the 2021 NHL Draft, the Flyers have reportedly acquired right-handed defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen from the Buffalo Sabres for Robert Hagg, the 13th-overall pick in tonight’s draft, and a 2023 2nd-round pick.
Sounds like Rasmus Ristolainen is going to Philadelphia in a package deal that includes the Sabres getting the 13th pick in the draft.
— John Shannon (@JShannonhl) July 23, 2021



Ristolainen, 26, has been the anchor of the Sabres’ blue line for several years now, but has some of the worst numbers in the league while playing tough minutes. With just one year remaining on his contract that gives him a cap hit of $5.4-million, this is certainly swinging big and gambling on a decent improvement if he isn’t subject to the league’s best forwards coming at him. Who knows if that will even happen.
With Ristolainen’s contracts on their books, the Flyers now sit around $8.4 million to re-sign Carter Hart, Travis Sanheim and fill out the depths of their roster.
More to come.]]></summary>

RubberNinja plans to swallow more than 138,000 eggs on Twitch
 YouTuber Ross “RubberNinja” O’Donovan has spent the last few days guzzling eggs in Final Fantasy 14 as part of an elaborate “sub-athon” challenge on Twitch. With the help of voice and chat commands, he’s been able to eat more 35,000 eggs from his inventory, with many more to go as people subscribe to his channel.
The streamer started this endeavor, cheekily called “Eggwalker,” on July 20, and has no plans to stop until he runs out of eggs. As per his set of rules: Every 1,000 subscribers refills his inventory with 999 eggs and if he hits 20,000 subscribers total, he will have to shave his head to become an egg himself. O’Donovan himself must only eat meals that include eggs too. And when it…]]></summary>

Get three weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Convergence
3 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Vest, Plate, Vestment, chest armor
7 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle 
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

 The conversation around Destiny 2’s disastrous Transmog system (aka Armor Synthesis) clouded the beginning of Season of the Splicer in early May, but Bungie is making a major improvement for next season.
Synthstrand — one of the three “Synth” currencies in Destiny 2’s overcomplicated Transmog system — will leave the game on Aug. 24, Bungie announced Thursday in its weekly blog. Synthstrand is one of the more controversial elements of the current system. Players currently need to generate 150 of them to buy Transmog bounties. However, days after the Transmog system went live, players discovered that Synthstrand is time-gated, meaning that players will only ever get one every …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Machkovech, writing for Ars Technica:
Sometimes, I want companies to lighten up and put the “fun” in
“functionality.”
That bias contributes in some part to my interest in the
Playdate, a $179 portable gaming system that errs on the
side of childish, low-powered fun. I’ve spent three weeks
testing the system’s “near-final” hardware ahead of preorders
opening up on 1 pm ET on Thursday, July 29, and I can confirm
that it’s indeed fun to look at. Luckily, it’s also fun, simple,
and accessible to hold, play with, and share with every friend
that I can.
Andrew Webster at The Verge got an early look too, and had a similar reaction. I can’t wait for it — Playdate looks like it’s going to be such fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From a good roundup of security updates announced at WWDC last month, by Carly Page for TechCrunch:
To ensure iPhone users who don’t want to upgrade to iOS 15 straight away are up to date with security updates, Apple is going to start decoupling patches from feature updates. When iOS 15 lands later this year, users will be given the option to update to the latest version of iOS or to stick with iOS 14 and simply install the latest security fixes.
“iOS now offers a choice between two software update versions in the Settings app,” Apple explains (via MacRumors). “You can update to the latest version of iOS 15 as soon as it’s released for the latest features and most complete set of security updates. Or continue on  iOS 14  and still get important security updates until you’re ready to upgrade to the next major version.”
I missed this news last month, and misspoke about it on the latest episode of my podcast, while talking about holding onto iOS 14 indefinitely if Apple doesn’t sufficiently improve the design for Safari in iOS 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is developing an external display that includes an A13 chip with Neural Engine, according to a new rumor from 9to5Mac. The A13 chip with Neural Engine would presumably serve as an eGPU, though details are light at this time.





Having a CPU/GPU built into the external display could help Macs deliver high-resolution graphics without using all the resources of the computer's internal chip. Apple could also combine the power of the display SoC with the Mac's SoC to provide even more performance for running intensive graphic tasks.
There were rumors back in 2016 that suggested Apple was working on a new version of the Thunderbolt display that included a graphics card, but no such display ever materialized. In fact, no Apple-branded display came out ahead of the Pro Display XDR that was introduced in 2019, and the Pro Display XDR is just a display with no GPU included.



9to5Mac believes that the display with A13 chip would be a replacement for the Pro Display XDR, and it's possible that the release version of such a display would use an even more powerful chip than the A13 that was first introduced with the iPhone 11.



Apple is also rumored to be working on a more affordable external monitor that would be sold alongside the Pro Display XDR, but this more affordable monitor is apparently separate from the version with a built-in A-series chip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, DigiTimes claimed that the upcoming iPad mini will feature a mini-LED display, but now, display analyst Ross Young is going at odds with that report, claiming that while the updated ‌iPad mini‌ continues to be on track for a release this year, it won't feature a mini-LED display.





Young says he "confirmed" with Radiant Opto-Electronics, who DigiTimes claims would provide Apple with the display, that the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ will not feature a mini-LED display. It's important to note that suppliers are tight-lipped about specific details about their client's work, especially suppliers working for Apple.



Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously stated that an updated iPad mini with a mini-LED display would launch in 2020, but likely due to the global health crisis and delays in production, that failed to materialize. The ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ rumor cycle has been rather cloudy, but some claims have pointed to a significant redesign featuring no home button, a Touch ID sensor embedded into the power button, a USB-C port, and a larger display. 



Rumors are also conflicting on whether the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ will feature Apple's current flagship A14 chip, included in the latest iPad Air and iPhone 12, or whether the iPad will use the A15 chip, destined for the upcoming iPhone 13. Rumors have also suggested that a "Pro" model of the ‌iPad mini‌ is also in the works; however, that doesn't seem to be likely.

Square Enix’s MMO has the problem of being too popular
 Final Fantasy 14 has been shattered before, but not by its own players. Droves of new and returning players are flooding the MMO’s servers, resulting in lengthy queue times and even a brief period where the digital version of the game went out of stock.
This leap in popularity is both unprecedented and unexpected. It’s abnormal for an MMO to see a spike in players during the lull between the last major content patch and the upcoming expansion. (For Final Fantasy 14, that’s the highly anticipated Endwalker.) Usually, this is when players fizzle out, take breaks, or swap to another MMO. It turns out, this is precisely what’s happening, but in the other direction: Disillusioned World of Warcraft fans are makin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The iPhone 13 may support faster-charging speeds with a 25W power adapter, compared to the current limitation of the iPhone 12, which only supports fast charging at up to 20W, according to a rumor originating from China.





The ‌iPhone 12‌ supports fast charging with a 20W or higher power adapter; however, even if users use a more powerful wall adapter, the iPhone itself only supports up to 20W. According to the rumor, Apple will provide users with support for a 25W power adapter this fall, and with it, it will release its own 25W power adapter as an accessory for purchase. Apple's current 20W power adapter retails for $19.99. 



Compared to 20W, 25W won't bring a drastic change to charging speeds or typical day-to-day charging for users. Many flagship Android smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21, already support 25W. Support for the faster-charging speeds will come alongside increased battery capacities for each of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which will come in handy on the higher-end variants due to more advanced displays.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max are expected to benefit from LTPO displays, which will not only provide users with a better viewing experience with ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate but may support always-on functionality.

Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack was launched last week for $99 and is meant to provide iPhone 12 users an easy and convenient way to charge up their device on the go. Apple is only offering the battery pack in a white color, leaving accessory makers to make cases and covers that customize its look. 



Nomad offers leather cases in both black and "Rustic Brown," and both colors retail for $35. The covers attach to the front of the battery pack using "microsuction tape" and "form fitting shape." Customers who pre-order the covers can save $5, and it begins shipping on November 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Ted Lasso," the most watched program on Apple TV+, saw its season two opening episode debut on the streaming service today. Apple is celebrating the premiere by giving the comedy series a full-page animated takeover on its website homepage.





"Ted Lasso" sees Jason Sudeikis reviving his Ted Lasso character that first debuted during the 2013 NBC Sports English Premier League coverage. In the ‌Apple TV+‌ show, Sudeikis plays a small-time college football coach from Kansas who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. 



The second season has been widely anticipated and was promoted by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's April event. The show regularly takes pride of place at the top of Apple's official ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ website, and also has a line of official merchandise associated with it.



For its first season, "Ted Lasso" received a record-breaking 20 Emmy nominations, the most of any comedy in its first season. It also won multiple awards, including a Golden Globe for Jason Sudeikis, who plays the show's namesake main character.



The second season of the show, which consists of 12 episodes, sees Sarah Niles joining the cast. New episodes will be released every Friday on ‌‌‌‌Apple TV+‌‌‌‌. Apple has already renewed the show for a third season, which the creators of the show have hinted may be its last.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple will release a new version of the MacBook Air around the middle of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in note to investors seen by MacRumors.





The upcoming ‌MacBook Air‌ will feature a 13.3-inch mini-LED display, which would make it the second Mac to gain mini-LED technology after the 2021 MacBook Pro, which is rumored to include a mini-LED display and is expected to launch later this year. Mini-LED display technology will bring a signifiant improvement in MacBook display quality, allowing for a thinner, lighter design while offering benefits like improved wide color gamut, high contrast and dynamic range, and truer blacks. 



Kuo has said that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will include a mini-LED display in the past, and the rumor has also been echoed by DigiTimes.



Prior rumors have suggested the 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will have thinner bezels than the current model, and that it will adopt the same MagSafe charging technology rumored for the MacBook Pro.



It's also expected to include a pair of Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, and there's also a chance that it could come in multiple colors, similar to the M1 iMacs that Apple released this year.



The 2022 ‌MacBook Air‌ will use an upgraded version of the ‌M1‌ Apple silicon chip that's faster and more efficient. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that it will feature the same number of computing cores as the ‌M1‌ (eight), but that will offer nine or 10 GPU cores instead of seven or eight like the current model for better GPU performance.



Kuo says that if component shortages improve in late 2021 and across 2022, MacBook shipments could grow to approximately 20 to 22 million units in 2022.

Hockey is right around the corner!
 We’re deep in the offseason and it sure feels like everything is happening at once. We just wrapped up the Expansion Draft, the Entry Draft kicks off tomorrow, and then there’s free agency opening next week, the Flyers are making trade... EVERYTHING is happening. And that probably means that this is the perfect time to remind you all that actual hockey is right around the corner! The schedule is here!
The Flyers’ season kicks off on October 15, a Friday, with a home game against Vancouver. That’s right, folks! It’s not a West Coast swing or a trip overseas to start the season, just a regular old home game. At long last. 
As a few more interesting notes, we do see a break built in for the Olympics in February (the  Flyers are off from the 2nd through the 22nd), we’ll see the Kraken for the first time at home on October 18, and while they’ll play the rest of their Metro Division rivals four times, we’ll only see the Devils and the Blue Jackets three times. Hooray?
It’s all swiftly approaching, and, as always, it sure is gearing up to be an interesting season. The full schedule is below. See you in October!

According to iDOS developer Chaoji Li, he tried to submit an iDOS update with bug fixes to the ‌App Store‌, but was told that the update was rejected because it violated the 2.5.2 ‌App Store‌ guideline that says apps cannot install or launch executable code.
During review, your app installed or launched executable code, which is not permitted on the App Store.



Specifically, your app executes iDOS package and image files and allows iTunes File Sharing and Files support for importing games. Executing code can introduce or changes features or functionality of the app and allows for downloading of content without licensing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack designed for iPhone 12 models came out this week, and Charger Lab has taken one of the new accessories apart to give us a look at its inner workings.






The teardown has detailed information on how the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ works and what each component inside does. There are two charging coils inside, shielding for heat dissipation, and a magnetic ring that allows it to attach to ‌iPhone 12‌ models.



There are two batteries inside that are connected together, with the previously known 11.13 watt hour energy and 7.62 voltage. Each individual battery is 5.733Wh, based on the internal labeling.



At the back of the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, there's a large metal plate to help with heat dissipation. Underneath the heat shields on the front, there are all of the chips that allow the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ to function.



Images from Charger Lab's teardown surfaced earlier this week, but this is the first time the full video has been available and it's well worth watching for those who are interested in what's inside the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌.



The ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ can be purchased from Apple's website for $99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what will be an increasingly common occurrence in the years to come, smoke from fires in the western United States and Canada covered a large part of the US over the past few days. The smoke drifted thousands of miles to the eastern seaboard and turned the skies hazy, the Sun orange, and the air dangerous for some people to breathe. But there’s good news: your Covid mask works for air pollution too!
Dr. Commane said people should avoid going outdoors in high-pollution conditions, and especially avoid strenuous exercise. She also suggested that wearing filtered masks can provide protection for those who can’t avoid the outdoors.
“A lot of the masks people have been wearing for Covid are designed to capture PM2.5,” she said, referring to N95-style masks. “That’s the right size to be very useful for air quality.”


It’s always nice when your apocalyptic dystopias match up so nicely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter's beta for iOS has gained "Sign in With Apple" functionality, with the end goal of allowing users to create Twitter accounts using their Apple ID, but still in beta, the feature is still not fully functioning properly.





Twitter researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered earlier this month that Twitter was working to port over Sign in With Apple to its service. Wong's report was based on code found within Twitter's website. With its beta app for iOS, Twitter is now properly testing the functionality, with some beta testers seeing a "Continue with Apple" option alongside continuing with Google or no third-party sign-up service at all.



In its current phase, attempting to continue with Sign in With Apple may prompt some initial errors, and once through with an account made, there are some quirks. Firstly, when users use Sign in With Apple, they aren't creating a specific password for that app or service. Instead, the app links the service to a user's ‌Apple ID‌. 



Currently, with a Twitter account made with Sign in With Apple, it's not possible to change account information such as email and more since the app asks for a password. These are technical loopholes that will get ironed out before Twitter rolls out that feature to all users.



Twitter is also testing other new features for its iOS app, including a new edge-to-edge timeline view for photos and an internal dislike button for tweet replies.

Spatial Audio and Lossless for Apple Music came to Apple devices in June, and has been available in a beta capacity on Android since last month. From the release notes for the update:
In this update, Apple Music adds a spatial listening experience on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.



Other updates include:

- Lossless Audio, a new way to experience uncompromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.

- Automatic Crossfade, a new way to listen that blends each song into the next for a seamless experience.

- Search enhancements to library, which allow you to more easily find your favorite music with in-line search.
In the Settings menu of the ‌Apple Music‌ app on Android, users can access an "Audio Quality" sub-menu with options to enable Lossless Audio and choose between different tiers where applicable.



Apple does not provide specific details on which Android devices are able to support the ‌Apple Music‌ features, and suggests in a support document that Android users check with their device's manufacturer.

The Flyers are making room.
 As the NHL lifted its roster freeze this afternoon, the Flyers had a trade to make official. After a bit of confusion surrounding which team would be sending draft picks, the trade became clear: Shayne Gostisbehere, a second-round pick, and a seventh-round pick to the Arizona Coyotes for no return.
TRADE ALERT: We have traded defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere, a second round pick in 2022 and a seventh round pick in the 2022 NHL Draft to the @ArizonaCoyotes. https://t.co/rYazFRoris
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 22, 2021



Gostisbehere, who passed through waivers last season, has two years remaining on his contract that carries a $4,500,000 annual cap hit. It’s been clear for a while now that the Flyers and Gostisbehere were no longer a good match, and giving the Coyotes a second-round pick allowed the Flyers to move Gostisbehere without retaining any salary.
Now more than ever cap space comes at a premium, and the Flyers had to give up a significant asset in order to get out of Gostisbehere’s contract. Paying a team with draft picks to take Ghost wasn’t how anybody thought his time here in Philly would end back when he was tearing up the league in his rookie season, but a combination of injuries, poor performance, and poor usage led us here. 
Arizona will be hoping Gostisbehere can find his game in the desert, and for Gostisbehere’s sake, the move hopefully leads to an uptick in power-play minutes as well less time watching AHL defensemen from the press box.]]></summary>

EA’s Motive studio will re-imagine the sci-fi horror classic
 Dead Space is back. Visceral Games’ sci-fi survival horror classic, originally released in 2008, is being remade by Electronic Arts’ Motive studio, the publisher announced during Thursday’s EA Play Live digital showcase. The new Dead Space is coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
Players will experience “an improved story, characters, gameplay mechanics and more as they fight to survive a living nightmare aboard the desolate mining starship, the USG Ishimura, all while uncovering the dreadful mystery of what happened to the slaughtered crew and ship,” EA said in a news release.

Battlefield 2042’s big new community-driven multiplayer sandbox revealed
 When Battlefield 2042 launches this October, it will feature one of the most ambitious multiplayer modes the franchise has ever seen. It’s called Battlefield Portal, and it brings together the maps, weapons, and vehicles of fan-favorite games Battlefield 1942, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3, alongside content from Battlefield 2042, into one massive, era-spanning mashup mode.
Imagine having aerial dogfights between a team of F/A-18 Super Hornet jets and World War II-era Hornets in the skies, while infantry on the ground battle hand-to-hand, with knives on one side, defibrillators on the other. Or one giant tank against 20 Explosive Ordnance Disposal ro…]]></summary>

Some anti-vaccination groups on Facebook are changing their names
to euphemisms like “Dance Party” or “Dinner Party,” and using code
words to fit those themes in order to skirt bans from Facebook, as
the company attempts to crack down on misinformation about
Covid-19 vaccines.
The groups, which are largely private and unsearchable but retain
large user bases accrued during the years Facebook permitted
anti-vaccination content, also swap out language to fit the new
themes and provide code legends, according to screenshots provided
to NBC News by multiple members of the groups.
One major “dance party” group has more than 40,000 followers and
has stopped allowing new users amid public scrutiny. The backup

Once you get past all of the Apple synergy stuff (Pages! Pencil! Apple TV+!), this is actually pretty neat and you can obviously do it with any device/app or even pencil & paper. They’ve even included a PDF of drawing references to make it easier.

In a world of new cosmetics, new maps, new events, and more ...
 Knockout City’s second season, a movie-themed romp through Velan Studios’ new multiplayer dodgeball game, will begin July 27 on all platforms. “Fight at the Movies,” as the season is called, will offer players another series of tiered rewards to claim, including new skins, new dodgeballs, and more.
Season 2’s premiere date was revealed in a sneak-peek development roadmap published at the end of June. In the same post, Velan said Season 2 would bring a new map, five new playlists, and three special events, among other features. Season 3 is due to launch in the fall, followed by Season 4 in the winter.


In the trailer shown Thursday at EA Play 2021, Knockout City’s new maps all took on the look of a Hollywood set, with a guest appearance from a giant mech stomping through one map. Other arenas included a castle and a strange, larger-than-life-size child’s bedroom.
Knockout City launched May 25 on all current platforms except for mobile devices. The full game is free for anyone to play, up to Street Rank 25, which is a good six or so hours of progression. That’s partly why the new game has been able to draw an audience of about 5 million players so far.
The game is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC via Steam and Origin, Xbox One and Xbox Series X. All versions are cross-play and cross-progression compatible.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-22T16:55:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colleen DeGuzman, reporting for The Texas Tribune:
Of the 8,787 people who have died in Texas due to COVID-19 since
early February, at least 43 were fully vaccinated, the Texas
Department of State Health Services said.
That means 99.5% of people who died due to COVID-19 in Texas from
Feb. 8 to July 14 were unvaccinated, while 0.5% were the result of
“breakthrough infections,” which DSHS defines as people who
contracted the virus two weeks after being fully vaccinated.
I got an email yesterday from a reader (well, supposedly former reader now) who was angered by my item linking to the “I’m sorry, but it’s too late” story from the Alabama ICU doctor who said the last thing her unvaccinated patients, hospitalized and unable to breathe on their own, do before being intubated is to beg for the vaccine. His email:
Your incessant corona whinery is getting rather long in the tooth,
but this disgusting gloating piece takes the cake. Even though it
probably is fake Facebook bullshit anyway, to even imply that this
disgusting ‘told you so, now you’re dead’ attitude is somehow
commendable is just tasteless, and it reflects on you personally
as you are sharing it.
Unsubscribed.
I’m a natural born gloater, I know, but there’s nothing gloating about my posts about COVID and vaccinations. These stories are heartbreaking at the micro level, and infuriating at the macro level. I am sad and I am angry about the state of vaccination denial, and the roles that powerful sources like Fox News and Facebook — neither of which should be trusted by anyone but both of which are trusted by zillions — have played in promoting it.
You don’t need any aptitude for numeracy at all to look at numbers like these from Texas to see that if you can get vaccinated for COVID, you should, as soon as possible. Both for your own personal good and for the good of humanity.

According to Apple's System Status page, iCloud Backup, ‌iCloud‌ Mail, ‌iCloud‌ Storage Upgrades, and Photos are experiencing issues that could be related to the outage. 



Akamai says that it is actively investigating the issue and is aware of a problem with the Edge DNS service. It is not clear when the issue will be resolved.



Today's outage mirrors a Fastly outage that occured in June, bringing websites like Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Hulu, and more down.

asking me to write that I was wondering if I could write the
absolute biggest benefit of the doubt and imagine that people
read it and said, “Wow this is exactly how I feel, thanks for
putting it into words.” What then? What would happen then? Would
people be “more aware” about climate change? It’s 109 degrees in
Portland right now. It’s been over 130 degrees in Baghdad several
times. What kind of awareness quotient are we looking for? What
more about climate change does anyone need to know? What else is
there to say?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sarah Miller, author of this 2019 article on Miami real estate & rising oceans, recently wrote this resonant piece, All The Right Words On Climate Have Already Been Said.
I told her I didn’t have anything to say about climate change anymore, other than that I was not doing well, that I was miserable. “I am so unhappy right now.” I said those words. So unhappy. Fire season was not only already here, I said, but it was going to go on for at least four more months, and I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself. I didn’t know how I would stand the anxiety. I told her I felt like all I did every day was try to act normal while watching the world end, watching the lake recede from the shore, and the river film over, under the sun, an enormous and steady weight.
There’s only one thing I have to say about climate change, I said, and that’s that I want it to rain, a lot, but it’s not going to rain a lot, and since that’s the only thing I have to say and it’s not going to happen, I don’t have anything to say.


Miller continued:
Also, for what? Let’s give the article (the one she was starting to maybe think about asking me to write that I was wondering if I could write) the absolute biggest benefit of the doubt and imagine that people read it and said, “Wow, this is exactly how I feel, thanks for putting it into words.”
What then? What would happen then? Would people be “more aware” about climate change? It’s 109 degrees in Portland right now. It’s been over 130 degrees in Baghdad several times. What kind of awareness quotient are we looking for? What more about climate change does anyone need to know? What else is there to say?


This is where I am on the climate emergency most days now (and nearly there on the pandemic). Really, what the fuck else is there to say?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO today officially shut down its Apple TV channel, forcing customers that previously used the channel part of ‌Apple TV‌ to access HBO content to upgrade to HBO Max.





HBO began promoting a notice to users on its ‌Apple TV‌ channel reading that it will be "ending its channel service on July 22" and that users are now required to "get HBO Max to continue watching." The channel was originally shut down for new subscribers when HBO Max launched last year, but existing subscribers continued to access the channel.



HBO Max is its own separate ‌Apple TV‌ app available from the App Store. 



Simultaneously, as HBO shuts down its ‌Apple TV‌ channel, several users are reporting across social media that HBO has removed the ability within its HBO Max app to sign in with an Apple ID account. Users who were previously signed up to HBO via the ‌Apple TV‌ channel had done so through their ‌Apple ID‌. Now, with the channel shut down and the ability to sign in with an ‌Apple ID‌ missing, some users are locked out from their accounts until further notice.



Some users have found success in retrieving access to their account by creating a new HBO Max account using the same email address used in their ‌Apple ID‌.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony today shared a new offer that allows PS5 owners to claim a six month extended free trial of Apple TV+. This offer is available only for people who own a PS5, and can only be redeemed once per PS5 console before July 22, 2022.





If you already have ‌Apple TV+‌ you can still redeem this offer, but if you subscribe to ‌Apple TV+‌ through Apple One, you won't be eligible to get the deal. You'll need to have an Apple ID with a payment method tied to the account as well.



To get the deal, search for the Apple TV app on the PS5 search bar, or in the Media home under "all apps." From there you can download the app if you haven't already, sign in with your ‌Apple ID‌, and the six month free trial will be applied to your account automatically.



Once the six month free trial ends, ‌Apple TV+‌ will renew at $4.99 per month until cancelled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CARROT Weather, a popular app known for its funny and sarcastic weather information, today received a major update that adds a new video Weather Report option.




CARROT Weather's News Reports and screenshot customization features


CARROT Weather users can now film 30-second TV news-style videos to share with friends using the onscreen script that the CARROT Weather app generates.



These quick 30-second weather reports turn CARROT Weather users into citizen weather reporters offering up current weather temperatures, next-day temperatures, and fake little news tidbits to add flair.



For premium users, there's a new Smart Layouts feature that changes the CARROT Weather interface based on the weather or the time of day. If it's raining, for example, CARROT Weather can automatically switch over to a precipitation-focused UI.





Today's update also introduces new layouts and designs for layout components, screenshot styles, along with support for wet-bulb temperature readings. Wet-bulb temperature readings are useful for determining human survivability in extreme heat events.



CARROT Weather can be downloaded from the App Store for free, and there is an optional $4.99 per month premium tier that unlocks new weather data sources, notifications, customization, widgets, and Apple Watch complications. There's also a higher tier $9.99 per month option with even more features. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For The Guardian, Annalisa Barbieri wrote Why I’m glad that I’m an ‘overthinker’.
“Just going with it” is not something I do. I have to really understand what I’m doing and then I think through almost every possibility and eventuality, like a mind map on steroids. And I plan. When people say things like: “Who could have imagined XYZ would happen?” about some entirely predictable outcome, my most common response is “I could”. I have realised that for most people I am an overthinker, but for me, it is others who underthink. I just think.


I have taken my foot off the overthinking pedal in recent years, but that paragraph more or less describes me to a T. My anxiety and overthinking used to feel like a handicap, like something to be overcome, but Oliver Burkeman’s persuasive argument in The Antidote convinced me to think about my anxiety as useful and even a little bit of a superpower, as long as it doesn’t spiral out of control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satechi, known for its line of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the launch of a trio of USB-C chargers that are designed for use with iPads, Macs, iPhones, and more.






The 66W 3-Port USB-C GaN Wall Charger is priced at $54.99, has a foldable plug, and offers three USB-C ports with output combinations of 65W, 30W/30W, 45W/20W, 30W/18W/18W, adding up to 66W total. This model is designed to charge a MacBook Air while also fast charging an iPhone and charging up an iPad at full speed.





Satechi's 100W USB-C PD Wall Charger, priced at $69.99, has a single USB-C port that's able to charge at up to 100W, as the name suggests.





The 108W 3-Port USB-C GaN Wall Charger also features three ports to work with, but it supports higher watt devices. It can charge with a single port at 100W, or in the following combinations: 60W/45W, 88W/20W, 45W/30W/30W, 58W/30W/20W, or 65W/20W/20W. It's available for $74.99. The 108W charger can charge a 13-inch MacBook Pro, an ‌iPhone‌, and an ‌iPad‌ at the same time, and it's high-powered enough to work with the 15-inch MacBook Pro models.





All three of the new chargers feature Gallium Nitride or GaN technology, which is designed to keep them small and compact. Satechi says they're all also CE certified and will charge devices safely and efficiently.



The three new chargers can be purchased from the Satechi website or from Amazon.com. Customers can get a 15 percent discount from July 22 to July 31 with promo code GANFAST15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside introducing the new MagSafe Battery Pack last week, Apple debuted new AirTag Leather Loop and AirTag Key Ring accessories in updated colors, but it appears there may be more official shades to come, if existing reseller listings are accurate.





For example, Amazon currently has additional AirTag Loop color options in Capri Blue and Pink Citrus, and both the AirTag Leather Loop and AirTag Leather Key Ring are listed as available in Meyer Lemon. 



The colors also appear in other third-party online retailers, yet none of them are listed on Apple's online store. All the resellers list the additional colors as out of stock until August or into September, so it's always possible Apple will also add them to its own online store at around that time. 



We aren't expecting any big product announcements from Apple until at least September with the launch of the new iPhone series, so the company may just silently add them to its accessory offerings for AirTag in the near future or tag them onto a big product press release. Watch this space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter is currently working on a "Voice Transformer" – a voice manipulation feature for Spaces, its live audio conversations service that rolled out to more users in May. 





"Voice Transformer" will provide several effects for users to change the sound of their voice as they engage in Spaces conversations, which could inject some fun into chats or perhaps be used by people who dislike the sound of their own voice. 



First spotted by app researcher Jane Manchun Wong, the feature manipulates voices by adjusting pitch or adding echo. MacRumors contributor Steve Moser subsequently revealed the full list of voice effects that will be available in Spaces. They include Bee, Cartoon, Helium, Incognito, Karaoke, Microphone, Phone, Spatial, Stadium, and Stage.

It's unclear when Voice Transformer will be available to use by the general public who engage in Spaces conversations, but code relating to the feature is already included in the latest version of Twitter for mobile, so it shouldn't be too far away.

According to the complaint, filed Tuesday in the Los Angeles Superior Court, female employees make up around 20% of the Activision workforce, and are subjected to a “pervasive frat boy workplace culture,” including “cube crawls,” in which male employees “drink copious amounts of alcohol as they crawl their way through various cubicles in the office and often engage in inappropriate behavior toward female employees.”
The agency alleges male employees play video games during the workday while delegating responsibilities to female employees, engage in sexual banter, and joke openly about rape, among other things.
Female employees allege being held back from promotions because of the possibility they might become pregnant, being criticized for leaving to pick their children up from daycare, and being kicked out of lactation rooms so male colleagues could use the room for meetings, the complaint says.
Some seriously fucked-up allegations, to say the least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 128 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, JavaScript, Live Text, Media, Performance API, and Web API.



The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.



Live Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an M1 Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.



Other updates include WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.



The new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both macOS Big Sur and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.



The ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website.



Apple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This piece by Susan Matthews is really helpful for those of us who are vaccinated and trying to figure out what their risks are regarding the much more transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is endemic now — how do we live with that? What reasonable actions should we take to keep ourselves, our communities, and our loved ones safe?
All of this is making people — yes, probably mostly vaccinated people — rethink the basic questions they thought their vaccine had answered for them: Can I go to restaurants and bars unmasked? Can I go back to the office? Can I see my grandma? Can I go on vacation? Can I unmask at my people-facing job? Can I have a wedding, or a party? The answer to those questions is not quite as easy as “yes, if you’re vaccinated.” It depends partly on how many in your group are vaccinated, but the actual answer is basically the same as it’s been all pandemic: It depends on your risk tolerance, it depends on what is happening with case counts locally (though, as more people travel, this might become a less reliable tool), and it depends on any unique risk factors in your group. Kass’ perspective felt novel to me: She said she suspects that in the end, a lot of people are going to end up boosting their immunity by suffering through a mild case of COVID. So no one should feel that bad about getting sick after they’re vaxxed. What matters is getting the order right: “If everyone who gets vaccinated still gets COVID but doesn’t die, that’s a success,” she said. The issue is that it doesn’t feel like a success for vaccinated people. Plus, “if you get infected after you’re vaxxed, it’s all you talk about,” she said. And right now, that’s understandably freaking out a lot of vaccinated people who thought they were in the clear.


Long Covid isn’t mentioned anywhere in here though — surely that has to be part of the conversation here (although anecdotally it doesn’t seem like too much of a worry).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New app from Garrett Murray (who should be familiar to long-time readers):
Air quality has become an increasing concern for many people
around the globe. While stressing about it constantly isn’t
necessarily helpful, the goal of the Breathable widget is to
provide a quick, glanceable answer to a new daily question: Is it
safe to go outside?
Breathable can use AQI data from two services: IQAir.com and,
optionally, AirNow.gov (in the USA). Both of these services offer
free accounts and API access for personal use. Breathable uses the
United States Air Quality Index for all values world-wide.
The entire point of Breathable is to offer widgets — the app itself just lets you configure how the widgets look. Brilliantly simple, and in a way, fun, with its clever “emoji scale”. I started using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but only because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather app — Philadelphia generally doesn’t have air quality issues. I should have known better. Turns out, the whole world now has air quality issues.
Breathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the proceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.

In a recent Facebook post, Cobia shares that people are willing to get vaccinated after having to watch an unvaccinated member of their family die from Covid.
I’ve made a LOT of progress encouraging people to get vaccinated lately!!! Do you want to know how? I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious COVID infections. One of the last things they do before they’re intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell them that I’m sorry, but it’s too late. A few days later when I call time of death, I hug their family members and I tell them the best way to honor their loved one is to go get vaccinated and encourage everyone they know to do the same. They cry. And they tell me they didn’t know. They thought it was a hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn’t get as sick. They thought it was ‘just the flu’. But they were wrong. And they wish they could go back. But they can’t. So they thank me and they go get the vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a small prayer that this loss will save more lives.


Heartbreaking.

Konami’s 20-year-old brand is retired in Unreal Engine 4 overhaul
 Konami’s soccer video game, known as Pro Evolution Soccer or Winning Eleven since 2001, is now simply eFootball. No PES, no numbering.
It’s also now free-to-play. And it’s developed in Unreal Engine 4, another franchise first. (From Pro Evolution Soccer 2015 through last year, it had been built with Konami’s Fox Engine, originally developed by Konami’s Kojima Productions for its Metal Gear franchise.)
Thus, Konami is calling eFootball “an all-new football simulation platform,” rather than an iteration and rebranding of PES. The publisher added “eFootball” to the series’ title in 2019.

The dislike button is visible to the person who is viewing tweets, but it is not a publicly available metric or visible to the author of the tweet. The thumbs down option will allow a tweet reply to be downvoted.




Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them. 
Your downvotes aren’t public, while your upvotes will be shown as likes. pic.twitter.com/hrBfrKQdcY

Twitter says that it is an internal tool that is designed to help Twitter understand what people think is valuable to a conversation.



There is no word on whether this is a feature that Twitter plans to roll out to everyone in the future, and for now, it is limited to a select number of users.

        <updated>2021-07-21T18:38:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of iPadOS 14.7 this morning, Apple has shared details on the security updates that are included in iOS 14.7, iPadOS 14.7, macOS Big Sur 11.5, watchOS 7.6, and tvOS 14.7, all of which came out this week.





Notably, Apple's documentation confirms that the iOS 14.7 and iPadOS 14.7 updates address a WiFi-related vulnerability that could impact iOS devices when joining a malicious WiFi Network.
Available for: iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation)



Impact: Joining a malicious Wi-Fi network may result in a denial of service or arbitrary code execution



Description: This issue was addressed with improved checks.
Back in June, a wireless networking naming bug was discovered, which could disable an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌'s WiFi functionality. Joining a network named "%p%s%s%s%s%n" could, in some cases, permanently disable WiFi on a device, and in many other cases, it required resetting an ‌iPhone‌ entirely.



During the beta testing process, it was discovered that the bug was no longer functional, and Apple's notes make it clear that the issue has been addressed.



The iOS and iPadOS 14.7 updates also address a number of other security vulnerabilities related to audio files, Find My, PDFs, web images, and more, so all ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users should update to the new iOS 14.7 updates as soon as possible.



There are also security fixes in macOS Big Sur 11.5, tvOS 14.7, and watchOS 7.6. For Mac users who run older versions of macOS, Apple has released security updates for macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Justice Department has continued pursuing those responsible for a 2020 Twitter hack that saw the accounts of high-profile companies and individuals hacked as part of a Bitcoin scam.





Several people have already been arrested and charged for the attack, and the DoJ today announced (via The Verge) that 22-year-old Joseph O'Connor, aka "PlugWalkJoe," has also been arrested.



A UK citizen, O'Connor was apprehended by the Spanish National Police in Spain, and he has been charged with multiple crimes related to the hack as well as crimes related to cyberstalking and takeovers of TikTok and Snapchat accounts. If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine sentencing based on U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.



O'Connor's role in the Twitter attack was previously highlighted by Krebs on Security, and in a 2020 interview with The New York Times, O'Connor claimed that he was not involved in the hack. "They can come arrest me," he said. "I would laugh at them. I haven't done anything."



Graham Ivan Clark, an 18-year-old considered to be the "mastermind" of the attack, was sentenced to three years in prison earlier this year. Mason "Chaewon" Sheppard from the UK and Nima "Rolex" Fazeli have also been charged in the attack and are facing prison time.



In the 2020 attack, hackers targeted Twitter employees in a "phone spear phishing attack," tricking them into thinking they were speaking to other Twitter employees. Using these methods, the hackers were able to gain access to Twitter's internal tools and were able to illicitly access Twitter accounts.



The parties involved hacked into accounts belonging to Apple, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and more. Tweets were sent out from these accounts soliciting Bitcoin, and scammers received more than $100,000.

The iPadOS 14.7 update can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings > General > Software Update.



Most iPad models are receiving iPadOS 14.7 with a build number of 18G69, but the cellular versions of the iPad Air 4 and the ‌iPad Air‌ 8 are receiving updates with a build number of 18G70, suggesting iPadOS 14.7 release was held back to fix a bug affecting these devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released macOS Big Sur 11.5, the fifth major update to the ‌macOS Big Sur‌ operating system that launched in November 2020. ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.5 comes two months after the release of macOS Big Sur 11.4.





The new ‌‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌‌ 11.5 update can be downloaded for free on all eligible Macs using the Software Update section of System Preferences.



‌macOS Big Sur‌ is a minor update focusing on small changes and bug fixes. According to Apple's release notes, the update improves the Podcasts app by allowing the Podcasts Library tab to be adjusted to show all shows or only followed shows.



It also addresses an issue that could cause Apple Music not to update play count or the last played date in the library, and it fixes a bug that caused smart cards not to work when logging into M1 Macs.



‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.5 is likely to be one of the final updates to the ‌macOS Big Sur‌ operating system as Apple shifts its attention to macOS Monterey, which is set to be released this fall.

Instagram Stories are Instagram's ephemeral content posting option, with each Story vanishing after 24 hours. Automatic translation is able to translate text into more than 90 languages, but there is no audio translation option.



In any Story that has a language that is not the user's native language, there will be a "See Translation" banner that can be tapped to get a translation.



Instagram has provided translate tools for standard Instagram posts since 2016, and the new feature means translation options are available across most Instagram media types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Verizon this week announced that it will be releasing a Fios TV app for the Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, and Amazon Fire TV tomorrow, July 22, providing Fios TV subscribers with additional platforms to watch live television.





All new Fios TV plans will come with Verizon's voice-powered Fios TV One box at no additional charge, and instead of subscribers having to pay a fee for a second Fios TV One box, they will be able to download the Fios TV app for the Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV and access the live television channels included in their plan using those set-top boxes. However, there is a limit of two simultaneous streams per Fios TV One box.



"Parents can watch live sports events on the Fios box in the living room while kids watch cartoons and teens watch comedies on connected TVs in their bedrooms," said Verizon. "With Fios TV One enabling more flexibility, Fios TV users can more easily place TVs in the kitchen, on the back patio or other areas of the house."



Verizon's new Fios "Mix and Match" plans will be available on July 22, with details and pricing to be shared at getfios.com.

The picks are leaking and Philadelphia is losing a depth dude instead of a big man.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are reportedly losing forward Carsen Twarynski to the Seattle Kraken in their upcoming expansion draft.
With the official list of the picks submitted at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Kraken’s selections have been slowly oozing out into the public minute by minute. And according to Frank Seravelli of Daily Faceoff, the Flyers selection is weird.
There was a lot of intrigue about whether #SeaKraken would be tempted to take one of the high-priced players the #Flyers dangled.
Hearing the selection was a bit of a surprise: Carsen Twarynski.
Can honestly say I didn't see him plucked in many mock drafts. @DFOHockey
— Frank Seravalli (@frank_seravalli) July 21, 2021



Instead of selecting the unprotected options such as Jakub Voracek, James van Riemsdyk, or Shayne Gostisbehere, Seattle is opting for the younger, cheaper option and avoiding any sizeable contract whatsoever.
Compared to the multi-million dollar cap hits of that exposed trio, Twarynski is currently a restricted free agent and will need a new deal (that is projected to be extremely cheap). Whether or not Seattle really likes what the 23-year-old can bring to their lineup is questionable, but with head coach Dave Hakstol at the reins, you can expect some reunions happening.
Flexibility over cap hits, apparently.]]></summary>

 Earlier this spring, EA Sports announced that its golf video game next year, the label’s first since 2015, would be the only one featuring the sport’s four major championships. 
Better make that five, actually.
The fifth is the LPGA’s Amundi Evian Championship, which begins Thursday in France. The Evian is one of that tour’s five majors, and both it and its course in Évian-les-Bains will feature prominently in EA Sports PGA Tour, due next spring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common form of malware on Windows systems has been modified into a new strain called "XLoader" that can also target macOS (via Bleeping Computer).





Derived from the Formbook info-stealer for Windows, XLoader is a form of cross-platform malware advertised as a botnet with no dependencies. It is used to steal login credentials, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, and execute malicious files. The malware was discovered by security researchers at Check Point Software. 



A server hosting the macOS version of XLoader is available to bad actors on the dark web for $49 per month. Check Point tracked XLoader for a six-month period, seeing requests from 69 countries, indicating significant use across the world. More than half of all victims were based in the United States.



Formbook continues to be a prevalent threat, being part of over 1,000 malware campaigns in the last three years, and XLoader is expected to have even wider use given its cross-platform capability and greater level of sophistication.



Head of Cyber Research at Check Point, Yaniv Balmas, said that macOS's growing popularity has exposed it to increasing attention from cybercriminals, who see the platform as a worthwhile target.
While there might be a gap between Windows and macOS malware, the gap is slowly closing over time. The truth is that macOS malware is becoming bigger and more dangerous.
According to Check Point, XLoader is stealthy enough for it to remain hidden to most users. It is possible to check for its presence by using macOS's Autorun to check the username in the OS and look into the LaunchAgents folder, where entries with suspicious filenames should be deleted.

Guilty Gear Strive’s first DLC fighter is Goldlewis Dickinson
 Fighting game Guilty Gear Strive’s first post-release character is Goldlewis Dickinson, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and right-hand man to the President of the United States, who comes armed with a studded coffin that contains an extraterrestrial being. Goldlewis Dickinson will arrive as downloadable content on July 27 for Guilty Gear Strive players who own the game’s season pass, and on July 30 for everyone else.
As seen in his announcement trailer, Goldlewis Dickinson beats people up with his coffin, which was seemingly sneaked out of Area 51 and contains a glowing alien ally within. All we see of Goldlewis’ outer-space friend is its arm; the extraterrestrial offers him aid in battle in the form of uppercuts, bombs, and the occasional massive mini-gun. It’ll even whip out a hand mirror for when Goldlewis needs to freshen up his ’do.
Goldlewis is over-the-top from toe to tip. He’s built like a coffin, wears multiple cow skulls, sports full-size horseshoes on his fingerless gloves, and can fire an eye-laser to call in orbital strikes on his foes.
Goldlewis Dickinson is one of five characters planned for Guilty Gear Strive’s season pass. Two more DLC fighters are planned for 2021, with two more coming in 2022.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dennis Pillion, reporting for AL.com:
Dr. Brytney Cobia said Monday that all but one of her COVID
patients in Alabama did not receive the vaccine. The vaccinated
patient, she said, just needed a little oxygen and is expected to
fully recover. Some of the others are dying.
“I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very
serious COVID infections,” wrote Cobia, a hospitalist at Grandview
Medical Center in Birmingham, in an emotional Facebook post
Sunday. “One of the last things they do before they’re
intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell
them that I’m sorry, but it’s too late.”
Good link to spread. Fox News should put this doctor on the air in prime time. (Via Dave Winer.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matt Yglesias, writing at Slow Boring:
In other words, they are acting about the Covid vaccines the same
way they’d act about a long-approved antibiotic or the measles
vaccine, not the way they’d act about a dietary supplement. They
are not saying you are allowed to get vaccinated, they are
saying you should get vaccinated. Indeed, that’s not just their
medical advice to you — it’s their stated belief (and I agree)
that getting vaccinated is a pro-social means of safeguarding your
entire community.
So I am saying, with a full understanding of the process, that the
FDA ought to bring the official regulatory status of mRNA Covid
vaccines into line with the scientific community’s actual
understanding and attitude toward the vaccines.
The government is not worried that Pfizer and Moderna might be
running a scam on us. They are charging $20 a dose, not
$56,000. We are begging people to take these shots. So we
should act like it.
FDA formal approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn’t the entirety of his argument, but it comes first because it’s so obvious. And the next steps — mandating the vaccines in places like schools and the military — require FDA formal approval.

Grab your Smartgun and a handful of turrets
 Aliens: Fireteam Elite has two things going against it. First, it’s a Left 4 Dead-style game in a year packed with Back 4 Blood and other similar titles. Second, it’s a game based off of the Alien franchise, a series with an exceptional debut film that has offered diminishing returns for over 40 years.
Aliens: Fireteam Elite isn’t going to blow Left 4 Dead and Vermintide fans away. And it’s not going to be the rare exception to the “Alien games are bad” rule, like Alien: Isolation. But in a preview for Aliens: Fireteam Elite, the game really surprised me in how much it nails the feel of James Cameron’s 1986 sequel to the original film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google today announced that it is expanding transit crowdedness predictions to more than 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries so that customers can better determine which transit options are at capacity and which have more open space and seating available.





In New York and Sydney, Google is launching a pilot program that lets Maps users see live crowdedness information at the transit car level, with the feature powered by the Long Island Rail Road and Transport for New South Wales.



Google is also updating its review process to make it easier for Google Maps users to leave detailed reviews. The review interface will prompt users to add information like price ranges or whether a restaurant offers takeout or delivery.



For Android users, Google has added a new Timeline Insights tab that's designed to provide details on modes of transportation used, miles traveled, and how much time has been spent at different places like shops, airports, and restaurants.



A Trips feature, also available on Android, lets users relive past trips that they've taken by resurfacing restaurants visited, hotels stayed in, and more. There is no word on whether Timeline Insights or Trips is coming to iOS, but these features require detailed Location History.



Google Maps for iOS can be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Music on Thursday will host a global livestream for the premiere of Kanye West's tenth studio album, titled "Donda."






The sold-out event will take place at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, and ‌Apple Music‌'s livestream will start at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. 



The livestream was revealed in a Beats Studio Buds ad that aired during the NBA Finals. The ad features U.S. track star Sha'Carri Richardson, who was recently banned from the Tokyo Olympic Games for testing positive for marijuana. 



Richardson is seen starting a training session at night to the sound of "No Child Left Behind," one of the tracks on West's upcoming album.



The event was later confirmed by Def Jam Recordings in a tweet. Kanye's "Donda" will be officially released the day after the event, July 23. 



This isn't the first time Apple has livestreamed a special event. Most recently, in February, Apple TV+ hosted a live premiere for its exclusive documentary "Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry."

In a statement to CNBC, Foxconn says that its main factory in Zhengzhou, the capital of the Henan province, had not been impacted by major flooding in the city, which has taken the lives of twelve people, according to local reports. Foxconn says that it had "activated an emergency response plan for flood control measures in that location" and is actively monitoring the situation.  

We can confirm that there has been no direct impact on our facility in that location to date, and we are closely monitoring the situation and will provide any updates as appropriate.
The heavy rainfall which has so far displaced over 100,000 residents of the province is expected to continue until Wednesday evening. Officials in the area have suspended the city's subway network and flights in response. Apple CEO Tim Cook says that Apple will be donating to relief efforts to support first responders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass production of the third-generation AirPods will kick off in August, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia. They will reportedly join a number of other products such as the iPhone 13 lineup and redesigned MacBook Pro models as launches coming before the end of the year.



Renderings of rumored third-generation ‌AirPods‌ design


Rumored launch dates for the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ have varied significantly over the past year, with some having pointed to a launch in the first half of 2021 that obviously failed to come to fruition while others indicated that a second-half launch was more likely.



With mass production kicking off next month, a launch could come as soon as September alongside the new iPhones, although Apple could certainly still wait to launch them alongside some other products later in the year.



The third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to adopt a similar design to the current AirPods Pro, with shorter stems and silicone ear tips for a customizable fit. They would, however, lack some of the advanced features of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ such as Active Noise Cancellation.



The ‌AirPods Pro‌ are also rumored to be seeing an update with the removal of the stems entirely, which could result in a design similar to that of the recently launched Beats Studio Buds. The second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ debut isn't rumored to be happening until the first half of 2022, however.

The main upgrades in the new model will be Apple's A15 chip that will appear first in the 2021 flagship iPhone 13 lineup, as well as 5G support provided by Qualcomm's X60 modem chip.





Just yesterday, a report from DigiTimes claimed that the 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌ will include an A14 chip rather than the A15 chip Nikkei is claiming.



With the next ‌iPhone SE‌ remaining similar in design to the current model, it will retain a 4.7-inch LCD rather than shifting to a larger LCD or an OLED display. The report doesn't specifically address whether the new model will include a Home button, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Re: yesterday’s piece about window proxy icons, Zack Katz found this archived version of Apple’s developer docs on the feature for Mac OS 8.5:
An application typically tracks the modification state of a
document. A common reason to do so is to inform the user that they
have made changes to the document which they might wish to save
before closing the window.
When your application uses proxy icons, it should inform the
Window Manager when a document has unsaved changes. When you do
so, the Window Manager displays the document’s proxy icon in a
disabled state and prevents the user from dragging the proxy icon.
Disabled proxy icons cannot be dragged because unsaved documents
cannot be moved or copied in a manner predictable to the user.
Figure 1-3 shows a proxy icon in a document window with unsaved
changes.
Katz tweeted::
@gruber I found this Mac OS 8.5 proxy icon documentation a great
read. It made me nostalgic — imagine being able to see saved
state quickly just by seeing the icon and title color!
Things have gotten so low-contrast…
Low contrast indeed. What a joyful little feature this was (and could be again). Clarity is the ideal that the Mac user interface used to celebrate but now largely ignores. I crave its return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A class action lawsuit that Apple was facing over "Flexgate" issues affecting MacBook Pro displays has been dismissed by a California federal judge, reports Law360.





Filed in May 2020, the lawsuit accused Apple of knowingly concealing an alleged flex cable display defect impacting some 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. The judge overseeing the case said that because the defect appeared after the warranty period, Apple was not required to disclose it because it was not a safety issue.



While the lawsuit has been dismissed, the judge is allowing it to be amended. Plaintiffs will need to include an argument that the ‌Flexgate‌ issue was a safety hazard, as well as providing evidence that Apple "knew with certainty that the alleged defect would occur."



The ‌Flexgate‌ problem affected MacBook Pro models released in 2016 and 2017, some of which began exhibiting uneven lighting at the bottom of the screen after a few years. This "stage light" effect could lead the backlighting system to fail entirely.



Repair site iFixit found that the problem was caused by a delicate flex cable that was prone to wearing out and breaking after repeated opening and closing of the display.



Apple updated the design of the display flex cable with the 2018 MacBook Pro, and launched a free repair program in May 2019 that covered the 13-inch MacBook Pro models from 2016.



The now-dismissed class action lawsuit was seeking restitution for all costs attributable to repairing or replacing affected MacBook Pro models, and it called on Apple to expand the free repair program to cover 15-inch MacBook Pro models.

Make Fallout 76 whatever you like
 Fallout 76 is a game where you can play with both strangers and friends — unless you subscribe to Fallout 1st, the subscription service that allows you to vibe in a private world. So far, there haven’t been too many upsides to having a private world, besides the luxury of farming the Whitespring Resort without having to worry about competition for the sweet loot within. That will change in September with Fallout Worlds, which will allow players to modify their own servers, developer Bethesda Game Studios announced Tuesday.
These customizable settings can be minor, like making the game a little easier or giving yourself infinite ammo. They can also be pretty big, like raising the height limit for settlements, building CAMPs in previously restricted places, summoning big monsters, or jumping as high as you like.
The Fallout Worlds update will add two modes to Fallout 76: Public Worlds and Custom Worlds. Public Worlds are a rotating series of custom servers available to all players. These are fun, wacky, curated experiences. Fallout 1st subscribers will be able to create their own Custom Worlds and invite their friends over (including ones without a subscription).
As of Tuesday, Fallout Worlds is available for testing on Fallout 76’s public test server, and Bethesda said it will continue to add new sliders, options, and abilities in the future. This is fantastic news for role-players, builders, and fans who are tired of getting murdered by Mirelurks endlessly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AP:
The chair of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural
committee was arrested Tuesday on charges alleging he conspired to
influence Trump’s foreign policy positions to benefit the United
Arab Emirates and commit crimes striking “at the very heart of our
democracy.”
Tom Barrack, 74, of Santa Monica, California, was among three men
charged in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, with conspiring to
act as an unregistered foreign agent as they tried to influence
foreign policy while Trump was running in 2016 and later while he
was president. […]
Prosecutors said Barrack not only agreed to promote UAE foreign
policy interests through his unique access and influence, but also
provided UAE government officials with sensitive information about
developments within the Trump administration — including how
senior U.S. officials felt about the Qatari blockade conducted by
the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries.
I’m starting to think Donald Trump didn’t surround himself with the best people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jon Stewart today shared a promo for his upcoming Apple TV+ show "The Problem With Jon Stewart," which is set to launch this September.





The three minute video that was shared on Twitter features a comedy skit making fun of tech company billionaires and space aficionados Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson.



The full video can be watched over on Twitter, and we're not going to embed it here on the site because it's very not safe for work.



Bezos is played Jason Alexander, while a mop takes on the role of Richard Branson. The short also stars Tracy Morgan.



We still don't know a whole lot about Stewart's upcoming show, but Apple has described it as a multiple season single-issue series with each episode to be about an hour long. "The Problem With Jon Stewart" will be Stewart's first television series since "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart" ended in 2015.

Plus, the Apple Arcade version gets a new update
 Mini Motorways, the sequel to Mini Metro, is now available on Steam after it originally launched as an exclusive on Apple Arcade in 2019. In Mini Motorways, the player is tasked with setting up their own little cities. Automated civilians build their own houses and little car parks, and the player has to be the civic planner who links it all together. Ideally, they achieve this by creating an efficient little system of roads and paths to connect the city. However, nothing is stopping anyone from building a nightmare city in which every road is as ridiculous as possible.
Mini Motorways is an excellent chill-out game, and there’s enough variety to keep things interesting. Players can choose between different cities: Los Angeles, Beijing, Tokyo, Dar es Salaam, Moscow, and Munich. The game is colorful and minimalistic enough to have a very Zen garden feeling to it.
If you have an iOS phone, it might be worth giving Mini Motorways a look on there, because the Apple Arcade version is receiving an update called Round Trip. This allows players to access two new maps — Dubai and Mexico City — as well as the ability to create roundabouts for extra-powerful road management.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ultra Wideband functionality that's available in the Apple Watch Series 6, iPhone 11, and iPhone 12 models is now accessible in additional countries, including Argentina, Pakistan, Paraguay, and the Solomon Islands, according to Apple's updated support page.





Apple is not allowed to activate Ultra Wideband technology in some countries due to international regulatory requirements, and it must be disabled in those places. All of the above listed countries previously did not allow UWB technology.



Ultra Wideband continues to be disabled in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.



The U1 chip in Apple devices is designed to provide much more precise positioning information than Bluetooth or WiFi, which is used for spatial awareness and more precise indoor mapping.



Ultra Wideband technology is required for the Precision Finding feature available for AirTags in the Find My app, and it is also used for Car Key functionality and more precise AirDropping between devices with a U1 chip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Yad Vashem, Israel’s official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, a collection of chess sets used by Jews during the Holocaust. Some of the sets predate the war while others were made and used in camps and in hiding.
Playing chess helped to alleviate the suffering of Jews and allowed them a few brief moments of relief from the hunger, the cold and the fear, temporarily easing their loneliness and sense of isolation.

As the name suggests, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is designed to attach magnetically to the back of an iPhone 12 model. It's sized to take up much of the entire back of the iPhone 12 mini below the camera, and on other models, it's a bit smaller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid spiking cases in the ongoing health crisis, Apple has started urging its employees to wear masks in retail store locations once again, and is mandating it in some areas, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.





Apple stopped requiring fully vaccinated customers and employees to wear masks at Apple Store locations in June, but with the Delta variant spreading across the United States and impacting even those who have been vaccinated, Apple is being more cautious.




Apple is now strongly urging retail store employees to wear masks again and is once again requiring it in some regions. Apple had dropped mask requirement for store employees in June. https://t.co/AfixiW5PIy
— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) July 20, 2021
 


In Santa Clara County where Apple's headquarters are located, local health authorities have begun recommending that masks be worn in indoor public locations, but it is not a mandate. In Los Angeles County, masks are once again required, so Apple employees in this area will indeed be wearing masks.



All Apple stores worldwide are still open at this point in time, and it is not clear if there will be further shutdowns in any areas.



Apple had planned to have its corporate employees return to work in September, but yesterday said that those plans have been delayed until October at the earliest. Corporate employees will be given at least a month's notice before they have to return to work.

Sun’s out, tum’s out
 Overwatch’s annual Summer Games event goes live on Tuesday, giving players another opportunity to play some Lucioball (and Lucioball Remix). It’s also a new opportunity to see the ripped abs of your favorite Overwatch heroes: This year, Symmetra, Ashe, and Sigma are busting out their six-packs for a hot hero summer.
Symmetra’s Mermaid, Ashe’s Poolside, and Sigma’s Scuba skins are all of the Legendary variety, and they can be obtained from loot boxes. They join Overwatch’s previously released sun’s-out-tum’s-out skins: Lifeguard McCree, Tulum Sombra, Côte d’Azur Widowmaker, Waveracer D.Va, Wave Hanzo, Surf ‘n’ Splash Tjorbjorn, and Lifeguard Pharah.
In addition to the aforementioned new skins, players can also get Referee Orisa — she shoots footballs! — and Sprinkles Mei from loot boxes, which you can see in the gallery below.
Players can also earn three Epic-tier skins for Hanzo, Pharah, and Winston by playing and winning games over the course of three weeks. Here’s how they’ll roll out:
Week 1: Ocean King Winston
Week 2: Sunset Pharah
Week 3: Nihon Hanzo
Overwatch’s 2021 Summer Games event runs July 20 through Aug. 10. It’s now playable on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One versions of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google today updated its Chrome app for iOS devices to version 92, introducing a new feature that allows iPhone and iPad users to protect their Incognito tabs with Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode.





Locked Incognito tabs will not be visible until authenticated after leaving the Chrome app and reopening it, which will prevent someone who gets ahold of your device from viewing your Chrome tabs. To enable this feature, you can go to Settings > Privacy > Lock Incognito tabs. Safari does not have a comparable feature for its Private tabs. 



Along with protection for Incognito tabs, Google has also added a feature for taking a screenshot of an entire web page. When taking a screenshot, use the "Full Page" option at the top of the screenshot editor to capture the entire page.



There's also a new Discover design on the New Tab Page, and Settings, History, and Bookmarks have been redesigned. Chrome will now ask for confirmation if you want to close all tabs from the Tab Switcher to prevent accidents, and individual tabs can be shared, bookmarked, and added to a reading list from the Tab Switcher.



Chrome can be downloaded from the iOS App Store for free. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the Apollo 11 moon landing, musician & poet Gil Scott-Heron wrote a spoken word poem called Whitey on the Moon. You can hear him recite it in the video above; here are the first few lines:
A rat done bit my sister Nell.


Back in 2011, shortly after Scott-Heron’s death, Alexis Madrigal wrote a short appreciation of the poem:
Let me just say that his track, “Whitey on the Moon,” changed the way I thought about the space race forever. It anchored the flight into the heavens, tethering it to the persistence of racial inequality, and pulling it out of the abstract, universal realm in which we like to place our technical achievements. Though I still think the hunger for the technological sublime crosses racial boundaries, it destabilized the ease with which people could use “our” in that kind of sentence. To which America went the glory of the moon landing? And what did it cost our nation to put whitey on the moon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter today announced that it has started rolling out a redesigned version of its TweetDeck Twitter client, which it has been working on since earlier this year.





The new version of TweetDeck is rolling out to a "limited number of accounts" of randomly selected people in the United States, Canada, and Australia.



According to Twitter, the new design is meant to better align with the design of the Twitter websites and mobile apps, incorporating more Twitter.com functionality.



There's a design that is indeed more similar to the standard Twitter design, which may upset TweetDeck users who are accustomed to the multi-column view. TweetDeck is gaining features that were previously only available though the standard Twitter website, such as an Explore topic.



Following this limited test, Twitter will likely be bringing the TweetDeck redesign to a wider audience. Those who have been selected for the beta rollout will see an invitation within TweetDeck to opt in.

Assassin’s Creed Infinity is loaded with potential
 Two weeks ago, the world was introduced to Assassin’s Creed Infinity, a service game that will be set in Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed universe. The internet erupted with the same collective groan around service games: they’re exhausting and there are too many of them. And while that’s certainly true, I’m excited for the potential of Assassin’s Creed Infinity, or at least the version of it rattling around in my brain. The recent Assassin’s Creed games have trended close to service games already, and I want to see what it looks like when Ubisoft officially takes the dive.
What do we know about Assassin’s Creed Infinity?

Limsa Lominsa is going to be a little less packed
 Final Fantasy 14 is currently having a moment in the spotlight, thanks to both the upcoming expansion Endwalker and a surge of big-name streamers picking up the MMO. Even though the game is technically in a bit of a content drought while adventurers prepare to go to the moon, the servers are packed. It’s enough of a problem that producer and director Naoki Yoshida published on Tuesday a note about server congestion, along with solutions like a timer that boots AFK players from the game after 30 minutes.
“Recently, we have experienced record user numbers in all regions, with a vast amount of new players beginning their adventures,” Yoshida said. “In particular, the increase in NA- and EU-region players over the p…]]></summary>

During his inaugural Flyers press conference, Ellis shed light on something that makes this deal even more interesting.
 Saturday’s trade for Ryan Ellis is already widely considered, by both Flyers fans and NHL fans in general, a slam dunk for Chuck Fletcher. In a pivotal offseason, Philadelphia successfully went out and acquired a top pair, right-handed defender with leadership capabilities, an excellent analytical and eye test acumen, and the ability to elevate Ivan Provorov’s play immediately. The price paid to do so was surprisingly low, with two assets at valleys in their value heading back the other way in Nolan Patrick and Phil Myers.
However, that said, there were two key risks in this trade for the Flyers: Ellis’s age and injury histo…]]></summary>

‘Caught in a flowing mist, a shower of petals, beyond the lights’
 Poets often feel like magicians, people who make magic from words, and create worlds from mere letters. I am a writer, yes — I do a lot with words, but not the work of poets. Wayfinder is described as an “art game” by creator Matt DesLauriers, an approachable browser game that makes poetry as easy as exploring a procedurally generated world.
It’s fitting then, that Wayfinder is a game starring a mysterious character, dressed like an otherworldly magician, working their art in a gorgeously illustrated world. Wayfinder is designed to be played for short sessions, no more than 30 minutes, I’d guess, as players freely wander and discover, picking up pieces of poetry…]]></summary>

One of the few Canadian players that went overseas, is a smart center.
 A common thread that has linked some players together throughout this weird year, is North American players that were lucky enough to get an opportunity overseas and break their professional seal, playing in various tiers and divisions while their junior leagues (mainly the Ontario Hockey League) was shutdown.
Mason McTavish is certainly the highest profile forward that was given the opportunity, and Brandt Clarke is another defenseman that might go in the first 10 picks on July 23, but center Francesco Pinelli is another dude that went across the Atlantic and was able to at least play some hockey to keep his name in the head of NHL scouting departments.

Real hockey is starting soon and we’re panicking.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are in the middle of a transaction-heavy summer, and despite the trade rumors, expansion draft estimates, and draft profiles coming in short order, we’re now looking not that far ahead to the 2021-22 preseason.
During the most chaotic week of hockey, they announced their six-game schedule to warm up for a very significant regular season.
It won't be long until we're all back on Broad St. https://t.co/phcTwzX8BT pic.twitter.com/uPEYUhWnMz
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 20, 2021



Full preseason schedule:
Sept. 28 — vs. New York Islanders
Sept. 30 — @ Boston Bruins
Oct. 2 — vs. Washington Capitals
Oct. 4 — vs. Boston Bruins
Oct. 5 — @ New York Islanders
Oct. 8 — @ Washington Capitals
As mentioned in the extremely saturated graphic, the times of the games are going to be announced at a later date.
In a cruel and unjust world, the Flyers are of course opening their preseason with a home game against the Islanders — a pain and a thorn in the back of this damn team for a prolonged amount of time. Luckily, there are no back-to-back situations with any team and we can wallow in disappointment if any top prospects don’t immediately shine against the Bruins or Capitals.
No matter what the results are, or even if they matter, you know that there is going to be enough discussion around the first lineups we see in Philadelphia within minutes on Sept. 28. The regular season schedule will be announced at a later date.
Now, it’s just the expansion and entry drafts.]]></summary>

The report claims that one of the key features of the new ‌iPad mini‌ will be the A15 chip, which is expected to debut in the iPhone 13 lineup later this year. The A15 is expected to be made with the same 5nm fabrication process as the A14 chip, and Apple is said to be working on a more powerful "A15X" variant for other iPad models set to launch at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon 52 years ago today in the Lunar Module (aka Eagle), they rode the ascent stage of the LM back to rendezvous with Michael Collins in the Command Module (aka Columbia). After docking, Eagle was jettisoned and the three astronauts returned to Earth in Columbia. It was presumed that Eagle orbited the Moon until eventually crashing into the surface, but a recent analysis shows that the spacecraft may have entered a stable orbit and is still circling the Moon decades after the end of the mission, a priceless artifact of an historic achievement.
Most spacecraft in lunar orbit suffer from instability in their orbits due to the ‘lumpy’ nature of the lunar gravity which tends to cause the orbits to eventually get so elliptical that they hit the moon.
However, an amateur space fan wanted to narrow down the possible impact location and used orbit modelling software to propagate the orbit forwards in time until it hit the moon. He was surprised to find that it didn’t hit the moon, and remained in a stable orbit for decades, this suggests that the Eagle may still be orbiting the moon over 5 decades after being left there.


The paper detailing the analysis suggests that if Eagle has survived, it should be detectable by radar.

July is big for flying on your Xbox
 Xbox Game Pass subscribers can take to the skies with the Xbox Series X release of Microsoft Flight Simulator on July 27, relive the dogfighting of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, or experience a journey through time with Xbox classic Blinx: The Time Sweeper on day earlier. All three games are coming to Game Pass at the end of July.
Microsoft says that Blinx’s and Crimson Skies’ Game Pass releases aim to celebrate 20 years of Xbox. Microsoft’s original console turns 20 years old in November, but fans will get to revisit the 4D action-platforming of the time-sweeping cat and the alternate history combat of those classic Xbox games all summer long.
In addition to the cloud version of Battlefield 5 and Cris Tales (available for cloud, console, and Windows PC), which hit Game Pass on Tuesday, subscribers can expect the following games to arrive on the service:
Atomicrops (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 22
Raji: An Ancient Epic (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 22
Last Stop (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 22
Blinx: The Time Sweeper (Cloud and Console) – July 26
Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge (Cloud and Console) – July 26
Microsoft Flight Simulator (Xbox Series X|S) – July 27
Lethal League Blaze (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 29
Omno (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 29
Project Wingman (PC) – July 29
The Ascent (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 29
Those titles join recent additions to Game Pass, which include Dragon Quest Builders 2, EA Sports UFC 4, The Medium, and Farming Simulator 19.
Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service from Microsoft. Xbox Game Pass is $1 a month for the first three months; after that, it costs $9.99 a month on either PC or consoles, with the Ultimate tier, which includes both, available for $14.99 per month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is looking to lease a large production campus in Los Angeles for Apple TV+, according to the Wall Street Journal.





Apple apparently told real-estate development executives about its intention to lease a Los Angeles production campus, presumably for ‌Apple TV+‌. The production hub could exceed half a million square feet in size since it needs to provide enough space to produce multiple TV shows and movies.



Many of the city's available spaces for production are said to be heavily booked for months in advance by studios that need a constant output of content, prompting companies to acquire space for themselves directly or lock-in locations with leases that reserve the space for several years at a time.



Mike Mosallam joined Apple in January this year as a lead production real-estate executive for Los Angeles, apparently looking to oversee the company's soundstage strategy. He previously worked as Netflix's director of production planning and studio leasing.



Apple is reportedly hoping to deepen its presence in Hollywood by opening the campus. The company currently leases individual soundstages to film for ‌Apple TV+‌ in Los Angeles and other areas around the world, but a dedicated campus could streamline the production process and reinforce Apple's commitment to compete with other video streaming services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LG has agreed to sell Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches at its "LG Best Shops" in South Korea from August, according to a report by the local Herald Economic Daily.





The Apple products will go on sale at 400 LG stores across the country. As part of the agreement between the two parties, all Macs are excluded from the sales, since LG's laptop offerings overlap with Apple computers. 



The news comes after initial stumbling blocks over the proposed deal appeared to make an agreement unlikely. According to the report, LG faced stiff resistance from the National Mobile Communication Distribution Association, which viewed the proposal as a direct violation of an earlier "win-win" competition agreement to do with the sale of mobile phones. 



However, a "negotiable in case of change" clause in that agreement has been cited by the regulatory bodies to argue that it is too early to judge whether LG is in violation, given its changed position in the industry.



LG Electronics recently announced its withdrawal from the smartphone business, and when it completely withdraws from the mobile business at the end of this month, retail space previously used for marketing its handsets will be vacant. Apple meanwhile saw an opportunity to increase its retail presence in Korea, and the two companies began negotiations.



Korea's Distribution Association is reportedly awaiting LG's official statement on the matter while it renegotiates the win-win agreement once it starts selling Apple's products in its stores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newly-launched MagSafe Battery Pack for the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max is now available for in-store pickup at Apple Stores in a range of countries and regions around the world.





Spot checks show that customers in the U.S., Canada, UK, EU, Australia, Japan, and China can now place an order for a ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ on Apple's website or in the Apple Store app and arrange for in-store pickup at a local retail location. In-store pickup may be one of the only ways to get a ‌‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ immediately as mail orders are already facing moderate delays of around one to two weeks.



Priced at $99 in the United States, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ attaches magnetically to the back of the ‌iPhone 12 mini‌, ‌iPhone 12‌, ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌, or ‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌, providing additional hours of battery life. Apple says the battery pack is able to wirelessly charge the iPhone at up to 5W on the go, or at up to 15W when the battery pack is connected to a 20W or higher power adapter with a Lightning to USB-C cable.

Fishing in a dreamlike oasis
 The Clawfish Arcade is accessible by train, a small boardwalk venue surrounded by dreamlike fog and lots of clear, blue water. It’s open only to me, the lone wanderer that’s free to skip stones off the dock, talk with the local seagull, or stuff coins into the arcade’s three crane games.
Clawfish, from developer David Czarnowski, was released in June alongside the Wholesome Game Direct — a showcase for independent video games. I downloaded the game just days ago, when it was listed as a featured game on Itch.io, and was immediately interested. Though I don’t have much of a fondness for fishing now, I grew up nearby a lake in the middle of a city, and I spent sweltering days with my feet hanging off the dock, fishing line in han…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is really quite odd. A group of scientists discovered that if they cool ordinary oily droplets floating in water down to around 2-8°C, they change shape, grow tentacles, and propel themselves around like tiny little sci-fi creatures.
Some of the particles’ facets grow while other shrink, producing a variety of geometrical forms such as kites, isosceles triangles and spiked tetrahedra. Then, from some of the sharp corners emerge tentacle-like strands, as if being extruded from a nozzle. As they grow, the strands bend into undulating shapes — and the droplets start to swim, propelled through the fluid by the tentacles’ extension.

There’s a general sense of “everyone dislikes the new Safari designs” and I know that’s not true, even though public sentiment is strongly against them.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend
 Warframe’s main quest and biggest antagonists will return to the game later this year with the release of a new content expansion, The New War. 
Lore-wise, The New War is a continuation of an ancient conflict between a group of AI known as the Sentients and the player-controlled space ninjas known as Tenno.
For the first time, however, players won’t be flipping and dodging in their usual Warframes. Instead, players can take the role of characters from around the Origin System who usually don’t get the spotlight. Grineer Soldier Kahl-175, Corpus Engineer Veso, and long-time NPC ally Teshin all showed up as playable characters in an upcoming New War quest.


During TennoCon, players could watch the digital stream on Twitch or show up in game and go to a special Relay. There, Digital Extremes loaded in scenes and moments from the story so far to help remind everyone what The New War is about. It’s hard to explain much without going into spoilers, but fans are excited because this story has been building for years. Everyone wants to see what happens to characters like Lotus, aka Space Mom.
The New War will come out later this year, along with cross-progression and cross-play across all consoles.]]></summary>

Something fundamental has changed since then. I don’t enjoy most social media anymore. I’ve felt this way for a while, but I’m loath to admit it.
Increasingly, I’ve felt that online engagement is fueled by the hopelessness many people feel when we consider the state of the world and the challenges we deal with in our day-to-day lives. Online spaces offer the hopeful fiction of a tangible cause and effect — an injustice answered by an immediate consequence. On Twitter, we can wield a small measure of power, avenge wrongs, punish villains, exalt the pure of heart.

XDefiant brings together the Splinter Cell, Division, and Ghost Recon series
 Ubisoft is making a new free-to-play shooter set in the Tom Clancyverse called Tom Clancy’s XDefiant. It’s pitched as a “high-octane,” 6v6 multiplayer first-person arena shooter — it’s “fast-paced firefights meets punk-rock moshpit,” said XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin and creative director Jason Schroeder in a reveal video.
Developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, Tom Clancy’s XDefiant promises realistic gunplay with personalized classes, represented as factions with special abilities. Those factions (Echelon, Outcasts, Cleaners, and Wolves) are inspired by other Tom Clancy games, like the Splinter Cell, The Division, and Ghost Recon series.
On top of deep personalization and customization, gunplay is a “top priority,” Rubin said. XDefiant will feature “an ever-growing arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments,” Rubin explained, boasting that Ubisoft San Francisco is crafting “every weapon attachment for precise, satisfying gunplay.”
An early gameplay test for Tom Clancy’s XDefiant will launch Aug. 5. Interested players can register at the game’s official website. The game is still early in development, its creators said, adding that “your feedback is essential to make this game great.” Schroeder said that Ubisoft plans to add to the game’s “diverse cast” with new characters, and Rubin said that Ubi SF is “committed to creating a welcoming game based on fair play and transparency.”
Tom Clancy’s XDefiant is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions for Amazon Luna and Google Stadia. Ubisoft promises cross-platform play. XDefiant was previously outed as Battlecat, back in June.]]></summary>

According to Apple's release notes, today's update allows users to manage timers directly from the Home app on the iPhone and the iPad. Apple says the update also includes general performance and stability improvements.



There have been multiple complaints of sudden HomePod failures possibly due to overheating with the prior 14.6 update, but it is not clear if the 14.7 software fixes these issues.

        <updated>2021-07-19T17:50:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, accessory maker Hyper today announced that its stackable 65W and 100W chargers based on space saving and power efficient gallium nitride (GaN) technology are now available.





The new HyperJuice chargers each feature a pass-through AC power outlet that is rated up to 1500W, which can be used to power devices with a pronged power cord like the full-size HomePod, or to stack additional HyperJuice chargers to create a "supercharger" with up to 64 ports and up to 1600W of power from a single wall outlet.



Priced at $69.99 on Hyper's online store, the smaller 65W charger features two USB-C ports rated at 65W and one USB-A port rated at 18W. The larger 100W version retails for $99.99 and is equipped with three USB-C ports rated at 100W and one USB-A port rated at 18W. (The 100W version is currently out of stock.)





Hyper says GaN semiconductor material based on Navitas GaNFast technology allows these chargers to be 10x smaller, 100x faster, and 5x more power efficient than traditional silicon chargers. A report earlier this year claimed that Apple is planning its own GaN chargers, but it is unclear when they would be released.

Developers can download the ‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌‌ 11.5 beta using the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper profile from the Apple Developer Center.



‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.5 introduces an update to the Podcasts app that allows the Podcasts Library tab to show all shows or only followed shows. It also addresses an issue that could cause music not to update play count and last played date in the library, and a bug that caused smart cards not to work when logging into Mac computers with the M1 chip.

‌Apple Music‌ users in India who have been upset that the new ‌Apple Music‌ functionality has been unavailable will be relieved to hear that the rollout has started.

Mesh technology offers whole home Wi-Fi coverage that is easily expandable by adding additional nodes, with Wi-Fi 6 offering faster speeds with lower latency compared to Wi-Fi 5,  which was previously known as 802.11ac. HomeKit support, which rolled out with a software update last week, allows the AX4200 nodes to be managed through the Home app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, complete with improved network security options.



Apple is also now selling Logitech's trackpad/keyboard case for the fourth-generation iPad Air, with key features including Smart Connector pairing, an adjustable kickstand, auto-adjusting backlit keys, and a cutout for charging the second-generation Apple Pencil without removing the case. The keyboard is available in gray for $199.95.

The latest Stories from the Outlands short tells the story of a child with cursed eyes
 Apex Legends has a new season on the way, and that means a new Legend, too. The latest of Apex’s always-excellent Stories from the Outlands cinematics tells the tale of Seer, a child with cursed, glowing eyes, and the next Legend to join the Apex Games.
According to the trailer, Seer’s eyes are more than just a piercing blue: They’re also so special they can reduce kings to beggars and oceans to deserts, whatever that means in the context of a battle royale game. While it’s not totally clear what his abilities will be just yet, his description in the season preview on the Apex Legends website may offer some clues: 
With microdrones and an artist’s eye, Seer spots opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seizes them in the most beautiful way he can.

Whatever his powers are it seems that he’ll feature plenty of style and maybe even have a few unique, hat-themed skins — which is exciting, because Apex currently has a distinct lack of good hats. 
Another change coming to Apex Legends in the new season, which is called Emergence, is the new Rampage light machine gun and the arrival of Ranked mode for Arenas. This season will also include some major changes to the World’s Edge map, but we’ll have to wait until EA Play Live on July 22 to find out exactly what those changes will be, as well as what else Emergence will have in store. 
Apex Legends’ new Emergence season will be available starting on Aug. 3 for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

Imagine that, 262 years. That’s the length of time you connect across. You’ll know the people who span this time. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that molds you, and your time is the time of the people you will know and love, the time that you will shape. You can touch 262 years with your bare hands. Your great grandma taught you, you will teach your great granddaughter, you can have a direct impact on the future right up to the year 2186.

Select Best Buy stores around the country will get a small shipment of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series cards
 Last September’s new graphics cards are still hard to find, but some fans may have a good chance of snagging one from their local Best Buys this Tuesday. The retailer will restock over 100 stores with a small supply of GeForce RTX 30-series cards on July 20. While Best Buy didn’t clarify which cards in the RTX 30-series will be available, some stores will likely have RTX 3060s, RTX 3070s, and RTX 3080s in stock.
On Tuesday morning, fans can line up in front of their local Best Buys in hopes of grabbing a ticket from an employee. Starting at 7:30 a.m. in that store’s time zone, Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer until they run out. The ticket guarantees the recipient an opportunity to buy an RTX 30-series card. A retail priced RTX 3060 can run players around $329, while the more powerful RTX 3080 cards go for $699. The middle card, the RTX 3070, will run players $499. 
Buyers likely won’t know which cards Best Buy has in stock until employees start handing out tickets. Stores will all have limited availability and only certain stores will get new supply. To see if your local Best Buy will get a supply of RTX 30-series cards, check out Best Buy’s complete list.]]></summary>

Now you can be a Tenno on the Ten-go
 Canadian developer Digital Extremes hosted TennoCon, the yearly convention for all things Warframe, on Saturday. During the event, the developer shared some previews of upcoming content, but the biggest change I’m excited for takes place under the hood. Cross-save, cross-progression, and cross-play are coming to the game, as well as a new mobile version.
All future updates, including the upcoming The New War, will now launch simultaneously across all consoles. Warframe is currently available for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.


This is, needless to say, a huge benefit to people who have sunk a ton of time into Warframe. I have about 1,000 hours on my main account, which means I could never get into a console version of the game. How could I give up my guns, gear, and frames? Now, I don’t have to make such a brutal choice. I’ll be able to play Warframe in bed on the Switch, which is the best possible change.
There is currently no launch date for Warframe on mobile devices; the port is “actively in development,” Digital Extremes said. We’ll likely learn more about cross-play and cross-progression as we get closer to The New War expansion, which is planned for a 2021 release.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recently updated support document, Apple has indicated that customers should not use products containing hydrogen peroxide to disinfect Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, HomePod, AirPods, and more. On the other hand, Apple has confirmed it is okay to use a 75% ethyl alcohol wipe to disinfect products.





We've emphasized the wording added to the support document below:
Using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe, 75 percent ethyl alcohol wipe, or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, you may gently wipe the hard, nonporous surfaces of your Apple product, such as the display, keyboard, or other exterior surfaces. Don't use products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Avoid getting moisture in any opening, and don't submerge your Apple product in any cleaning agents. Don't use on fabric or leather surfaces.
Apple says to avoid getting moisture in any opening when disinfecting products, and warns against submerging an Apple product in any cleaning agents, as liquid damage is not covered by Apple's standard warranty.



Many common household cleaning brands offer solutions with hydrogen peroxide, such as Lysol, so be sure to read labels as necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his Art History School YouTube channel, Paul Priestley gives a short but thorough overview of the life and work of pioneering abstract artist Hilma af Klint.
Hilma af Klint shared an interest in the spiritual with the other pioneers of abstract art including Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian. And like Hilma af Klint many were drawn to Theosophy, which opened a route towards a new world of spiritual reality, rather than merely depicting visual impressions of the world around them.
Had she not kept her abstract work secret she would surely have held the accolade of producing the world’s first abstract paintings. Instead, Kandinsky’s paintings of 1911 would, until recently, come to be recognised as the first abstract works of art.

Newcomers will enjoy a Drive To Survive-like story mode, and old-timers get a slew of options to extend their experience
 In F1 2020, I took advantage of 4,811 flashbacks in more than 122 hours of on-track time, or almost 40 per hour. Flashbacks are when the driver, in a single-player mode, rewinds the game to the point where they made a mistake, like a daring move that proved horrifically reckless, for a do-over. In F1 2020, the flashback menu option is an unlimited-or-nothing user assist.
But in F1 2021, diehards and perfectionists like me who shamefully admit their flashback dependency can taper their use again. Racing with a high, medium, or low number of flashbacks (or unlimited, or none) is a simple difficulty setting, one of many brought …]]></summary>

Not related to the former Coyotes GM.
 Today, we transition from an offensive defenseman in Scott Morrow to a defensive defenseman out of Russia in Daniil Chayka. With a big frame (6’3”, 185 lbs), many scouts see the potential for a solid anchor on an NHL team with range in Chayka. However, he hasn’t put up points across junior and senior levels this past season, and his offensive awareness leaves much to be desired. Some view Chayka as the heir-apparent to Chris Pronger, while others see him in a much less desirable way, as evidenced by his wide range of scouting rankings.

Russell shared some early impressions of the battery pack, noting that it is designed with hard but smooth plastic and has a very strong magnetic attraction to his iPhone 12 Pro, even with Apple's silicone MagSafe case on the device. He added that while the battery pack is quite thick, its rounded edges make it comfortable to hold.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



This price is beating the typical Amazon sale by $7, and it's the best sale currently available at a major Apple reseller online this week. This is also the most common sale that we've tracked on the AirPods Pro in 2021, typically seen at both Woot and on Amazon.




$59 OFF
AirPods Pro for $189.99





For the lower-cost model, Amazon has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for $119.99, down from $159.00. We've seen this model drop to $109 in the past, but this is another example of rare sales that haven't reemerged very often since their popularity earlier in 2021.




$39 OFF
AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $119.99





Lastly, the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is marked down to $149.99, from $199.00. Similar to the previous sale, this is a solid second-best option given that we haven't seen any steeper discounts on this model of AirPods since early 2021.




$49 OFF
AirPods w/ Wireless Charging Case for $149.99





We track sales for every model of the AirPods in our Best AirPods Deals guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.

Tim Schafer reflects on Psychonauts 2 and this unique point in Double Fine’s history 
 Double Fine Productions is a studio that knows the ups and downs of game development all too well. Between publishing deals falling through the cracks, layoffs, multiple game delays, and a lawsuit involving two of the largest video game companies in the business, the team has had to deal with its fair share of instability.
When the company announced the sequel to its cult hit Psychonauts, founder Tim Schafer thought making the game would be a “two-year cakewalk,” Schafer told Polygon in a recent Zoom call. Turns out, developing the title became a “five-year roller coaster.”

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…
 *The big pre-expansion draft splash was made by ... the Flyers!? Ryan Ellis is a Philadelphia Flyer, and boy are we all giddy about it. [BSH]
*To get Ellis, the team sent Phil Myers and Nolan Patrick the other way. The Predators then flipped Patrick to Vegas for Cody Glass. It’s honestly stunning that the Flyers were able to add Ellis without moving the 13th overall pick or one of their top prospects. Helluva job, Chuck. [BSH]
*Speaking of Chuck Fletcher, the Flyers’ General Manager had some interesting things to say about the move for Ellis. And their plan for that first-round pick? Well, that’s still up in the air. [BSH]
*Charlie broke down the Ellis trade from all angles, and honestly the deeper you dive into it, the more this starts to feel like a perfect fit. [The Athletic]
*Of course, the big trade wasn’t the only news to break over the weekend. We also learned who the Flyers have chosen to protect in the looming expansion draft. [BSH]
*There were reports that the Flyers were going to protect James van Riemsdyk after trading Nolan Patrick, but they turned out to be incorrect. The surprise addition? Nicolas Aube-Kubel. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Back-to-back games in the same city were something that the NHL leaned on last season to get through the condensed schedule. It’s looking like they may be here to stay. [Philly Hockey Now]
*In other expansion news, Carey Price waived his no-movement clause and was left unprotected by the Montreal Canadiens. He’s also injured, and may not be ready for the start of next season. [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*A complete list of every player both protected, and available, in the Seattle expansion draft. Who will be joining the Kraken? [The Athletic]
*REMINDER: It’s draft week, and we are back to hosting draft parties! Come hang out with us at Xfinity Live as we watch the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. [BSH]]]></summary>

Even more news!
 We’ve got some more news to report here, folks! The protected lists for Wednesday’s Expansion Draft have been released, and we’ve got our answers as to what the Flyers are going to do at long last. 
The Flyers’ protected players are as follows:
Forwards: Nicolas Aube-Kubel, Sean Couturier, Claude Giroux, Kevin Hayes, Travis Konecny, and Scott Laughton
Defensemen: Ryan Ellis, Ivan Provorov, and Travis Sanheim
Goaltender: Carter Hart
This means that the exposed skaters include James van Riemsdyk, Jake Voracek, Justin Braun, Shayne Gostisbehere, and Robert Hagg.
Are there any big surprises here? Not really. There may have been a bit of initial shock seeing Aube-Kubel on the protected list, but it’s a move that does make sense. A real emphasis for the Flyers this offseason, understandably, seems to be freeing up some cap space to have the flexibility to make some more moves, and this gives them the best chance of doing that. The Kraken no longer have the option of picking up Aube-Kubel because he’s cheap and has potential, but would have to pick up a player like van Riemsdyk, Voracek, or Gostisbehere who carry a higher cap hit. Granted, they could still go for Braun and add some good and lower cost depth, but this ensures that the Flyers have the greatest chance of seeing some money come off the books on Expansion Draft Day. 
The Expansion Draft, of course, will take place on Wednesday July 21 at 8:00 ET, and we’ll see how Seattle decides to play this then.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple can be expected to release its redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros sometime between September and November, as part of another packed fall season for new product launches, according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman.





In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says that the new MacBook Pros will go into production in the third quarter and can be expected to be announced by Apple "between September and November at the latest." Apple last year announced an updated MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini powered by the M1 in November. 



Gurman notes that Apple had originally planned to release the new MacBook Pros earlier this year, but continued complications around mini-LED production delayed their launch. 



The new MacBook Pros are expected to be high in demand thanks to several significant features and changes. On top of a new design featuring flat-edges and more ports, Apple plans to include mini-LED displays in the new laptops, the same one used in the high-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro announced this past April. Faster Apple silicon chips will also power the new MacBook Pros. Learn more about everything we know about the upcoming MacBook Pros with our guide.

A blockbuster trade and encouraging sentiment regarding the move makes for an all-around productive day for the organization.
 Chuck Fletcher addressed the Philadelphia Flyers’ biggest need heading into the 2021-22 season: a true top-pairing defenseman. News broke late Saturday afternoon that the Flyers had acquired Ryan Ellis from the Nashville Predators, with Phil Myers and Nolan Patrick heading the other way. Ellis, 30, is under contract for the next six seasons with an annual cap hit of $6,250,000.


Fletcher spoke to the media just after the Flyers had officially announced the trade, calling Ellis one of the best passers in the game. “Ryan is an excellent all-around defenseman. In our opinion, he’s one of the best passers in the gam…]]></summary>

Well in, Chuck. Well in.
 Fourteen years ago, also over the summer (in what would turn out to be a very busy offseason for the Flyers), a trade was made by the Flyers for a veteran Nashville Predators defenseman. For the shrewd price of only a first round pick (who would turn out to be Jonathon Blum, who only played 110 NHL games), the Flyers acquired a defenseman who would become a franchise icon, and who would help lead them all the way to multiple Eastern Conference Finals appearances, and even to a Stanley Cup Final. Of course, the player in question is Kimmo Timonen.
The Flyers will certainly be hoping that their newly acquired defenseman and another former Predator, Ryan Ellis, will have a similar if not greater impact on this ho…]]></summary>

Well, there’s your first big move on defense.
 Just in time for the NHL trade freeze this afternoon, the Flyers have made a move to address their blue line like we knew they had to — and it’s a big one. The Flyers have acquired Ryan Ellis from the Nashville Predators in a three-way deal including Las Vegas, and will be giving up defenseman Philippe Myers and center Nolan Patrick to do so.

An offensive defenseman with a ton of skill, but some serious concerns defensively.
 Up next in our draft board, we take a look at right-handed blueliner Scott Morrow. The University of Massachusetts commit is coming off a strong season with Shattuck St. Mary’s of the USHS Prep League, and even got six playoff games with the Fargo Force in the USHL.
Morrow, much like many young defenseman nowadays, is an absolute offensive threat. He’s got the skill to carve up forwards exiting the zone, and the speed and skating talent to create zone entries. He needs to refine his game especially on the defensive side, but this kid has some serious raw talent that just might be enough on its own to carry him to the NHL.

Our hearts are with all those affected by the devastating flooding across Germany, Belgium and Western Europe. Apple will be donating to support relief efforts.

Apple often donates money during natural disasters and has donated several times to fund wildfire relief efforts in California. Most recently, Apple donated to organizations in Texas amid harsh winter temperatures in February.

Taego even includes a self-revive feature
 PUBG is back with its first new map in a while, and it’s set in Korea. The new map, Taego, is part of the game’s 12.2 update, which also adds a self-revive item, a mini-battle royale to get you back into a match after you die, and dozens of other changes. 
Taego is an 8-km-by-8-km map set in the Korean countryside. PUBG in-game unit lead Taehyun Kim said in an email interview with Polygon that the goal of this map was to show players the beauty of Korea, especially around the 1980s and ’90s. 
The map is full of villages, towns, and even a maximum-security prison for players to explore. Even more importantly, for all the players that have missed PUBG’s larger maps, Taego has tons of open ground to fight over.

 Nothing can stop the slow, unrelenting crawl of the Minions empire. 
The babbling buffoons have gotten three Despicable Me movies, a cartoon series, and a Minion-centric spinoff movie, and they’ll star in an upcoming sequel to the offshoot called Minions: The Rise of Gru. Their reach knows no bounds, and now, they’re available in Minecraft. 
The Minions x Minecraft add-on from Illumination launched Friday, and you can buy it in the Minecraft Marketplace.
The downloadable content does more than just add blocky versions of the yellow one-eyed characters to Minecraft. It also lets you help Gru fight villains like Vicious Six, El Macho, and Vector. It’s apparently part of the lead-up to Minions: The Rise of Gru, which comes to theaters on July 1, 2022.
Mojang has added skin packs and additional content for countless franchises — Mario, Star Wars, Sonic the Hedgehog, you name it. Given how long it’s been, it’s about damn time that we get some quality Minions content in the game.]]></summary>

Why Red Dead Online’s issues run deep
 The newest Red Dead Online update, Blood Money, focuses on the criminal side of frontier life. There’s a new currency, new missions, and lots of quality-of-life changes to the usual cowboy formula. Blood Money is perfectly fine; it doesn’t transform the game or add elaborate, wild new professions ... but if you like Red Dead Online, you’ll probably like Blood Money.
The problem is that many Red Dead Online players don’t really seem to like Red Dead Online right now. This cromulent content update has done little to calm down an increasingly frustrated fanbase. So why are cowboys so rootin’ tootin’ mad at Rockstar Games?
Red Dead Online has had a bit of a content drought, especially compared to its sister game Grand Theft …]]></summary>

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Adorama. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



This sale beats the current Amazon price tag by about $30, and is now a new all-time low price on the AirPods Max. The high-end headphones are in stock on Adorama and ready to ship, and the retailer does offer some free shipping options.



Shoppers should note that there have been a few oddities on Adorama's website today, and you may notice the $100 off deal disappear when clicking through various colors on the retailer's page. Closing out and clicking back into the website through one of the links in this article does seem to help.




$100 OFF
AirPods Max for $449.00





AirPods Max feature Active Noise Cancellation technology and the same Transparency mode, Adaptive EQ, and spatial audio features that are in the AirPods Pro. For charging, the headphones come with a Smart Case made out of a soft material that puts AirPods Max in an ultra low-power state to preserve battery charge when not in use.



We track sales for every model of the AirPods in our Best AirPods Deals guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.

Get three weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Pacifica
3 wins — Igneous Hammer, Energy hand cannon
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Strides, Boots, Greaves, leg armor
7 wins — Sola’s Scar, Power sword 
Flawless — Exile’s Curse (Adept), Energy fusion rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with Astropad to offer MacRumors readers a chance to win a Luna Display adapter that can turn an extra Mac or iPad into a secondary display for a primary Mac.

Sonic: Lost World brought Wii U owners the ‘Zelda Zone’
 The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD came out Friday for Nintendo Switch, but personally, I can’t stop thinking about that one time Sonic the Hedgehog went to Hyrule. 
Sonic ventured to The Legend of Zelda Zone as part of downloadable content for Sonic: Lost World, a 3D Sonic game that was released on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in 2013. The Zelda Zone was essentially a Sonic course that took inspiration from various Zelda games like Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword. (Sonic also got to visit the Yoshi Zone in a separate bit of DLC for Lost World.)
Throughout the level, Sonic runs through recognizable Zelda locales like Hyrule Field and Death Mountain. Every now and then, we’ll see Link soaring overhead on a Loftwing. At one point, Sonic gets launched up into the air, and Link waves at him.


The level is just really dang cute. In addition to Sonic wearing Link’s iconic green tunic, it’s filled with other references. It swaps out Sonic’s golden rings for rupees. All the music is from Zelda. Also, Sonic can open chests and get new heart containers that expand his health bar. At the very end, Sonic finds a special surprise. You can check out a full playthrough of the level here. 
It’s fun to see because, besides the occasional brawl, Link and Sonic don't get to meet each other all that much. Here, they both get to adventure through the big green world together.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Lynch, who is well known at Apple for overseeing work on the Apple Watch, is set to take on a role leading the development of the Apple Car, reports Business Insider.





Several sources within Apple told Business Insider that Apple has been called on to help lead the ‌Apple Car‌ project, which has undergone several shifts in leadership over the years.



Right now, ‌Apple Car‌ development is overseen by John Giannandrea, Apple's AI and machine learning chief who took over the reins from Bob Mansfield after Mansfield retired in 2020. Rumors about the ‌Apple Car‌ have suggested that leadership issues and internal strife have impacted the project, which is perhaps no surprise given what a massive undertaking it is.



Prior to bringing the Apple Watch to fruition, Lynch worked at Adobe and helped create Creative Cloud, plus he has worked on Apple's healthcare strategy team, so he has a diverse background. Business Insider says that his title will not change and he will continue to be involved with both the Apple Watch and Apple's health initiatives, but he is stepping back from Jeff Williams' health care staff and will be replaced by director of health software engineering Evan Doll on that team.



Apple is now at a stage where it is sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the ‌Apple Car‌, requiring more hands-on help from experienced executives within Apple.



Work on an ‌Apple Car‌ is still in the early stages and multiple sources have said that a finished self-driving vehicle could be released sometime between 2025 to 2028. We have more on the development of the ‌Apple Car‌ in our Apple Car roundup.

As we near the draft, it’s time to take a look at the other goalie prospect likely to be taken in the first round.
 Today, in continuation of our community draft board series, we’ll be taking a look at Sebastian Cossa. The towering netminder has flashed plenty of promise in the WHL with the Edmonton Oil Kings, intriguing scouts with his blend of respectable athleticism, ideal frame, and cerebral approach to the position.
Cossa put up impressive stats with one of the WHL’s best teams in 2020-21, and is arguably the biggest reason behind Edmonton’s first place finish. The 6’6” tendy went 17-1-1 with a 1.57 GAA and .941 SV% in 19 games this season, putting him in league with some of the best goalie prospects to come out of the WHL in recent memory (t…]]></summary>

There is a moment at the end of the film’s second act when the artist David Choe, a friend of Bourdain’s, is reading aloud an e-mail Bourdain had sent him: “Dude, this is a crazy thing to ask, but I’m curious” Choe begins reading, and then the voice fades into Bourdain’s own: “…and my life is sort of shit now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surging popularity of AirPods has reportedly resulted in record numbers of counterfeit wireless headphones being seized at the U.S. border.





According to The Information's Wayne Ma, roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones with a retail value of $62.2 million were confiscated in the first nine months of the U.S. government's fiscal year, based on data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. By comparison, the report claims 295,000 counterfeits with a retail value of $61.7 million were seized at the U.S. border in the entire 2020 fiscal year.



U.S. Customs told The Information that 80% of all counterfeit products coming into the U.S. were from mainland China or Hong Kong. While it's unclear how many of the seized counterfeit headphones were AirPods, U.S. Customs said seizures have increased 50% in the past five years as products such as Apple's earbuds have gained popularity. 



The retail value of counterfeit wireless headphones seized by U.S. Customs appears to have skyrocketed following the release of AirPods Pro in October 2019.





MacRumors shared a comparison of real and fake AirPods Pro back in 2019:






The Information examined counterfeit AirPods Pro sold in Hong Kong in December, noting that they had a genuine Apple serial number and were physically indistinguishable from legitimate AirPods Pro, and even had functional active noise cancellation and Transparency mode features. The report claims one of the only ways to determine that the AirPods were fake was by looking up their firmware version, which was incorrect.

Over 40 weapons got changes
 Call of Duty season’s 4 Reloaded patch may not have been earth-shattering for Black Ops Cold War, but Warzone’s brought way more changes than usual to make up for it. In the latest patch for the battle royale game, Raven Software has rebalanced over 40 guns in the most comprehensive weapon-tuning update Warzone has ever received. 
According to a long note in the patch notes’ weapon-balance section, these changes are designed to help increase the overall time to kill in Warzone. One of the biggest ways that Raven is going about this is by nerfing the torso-damage multiplier for many weapons — since it’s the most commonly hit area of a target. At the same time, Raven says that it wants to promote accuracy, so headshots will con…]]></summary>

Angry Birds Reloaded features familiar physics-based bird slingshotting action from the original game, with new characters and visual enhancements. There is also a new game mode with eagles wreaking havoc on the island. 






Doodle God Universe is a world building game that tasks players with mixing and matching elements like water and stone to create an entire universe.



First released in 2018, Alto's Odyssey is an award-winning endless sandboarding game with beautiful procedurally generated graphics, dynamic lighting and weather conditions, and original music. In the Apple Arcade edition of the game, players embark on a sandboarding journey to find a new biome called The Lost City and unearth the secrets hidden within, with the classic Alto's Odyssey experience preserved.





The classic endless runner Jetpack Joyride+ is also coming to Apple Arcade on July 23. 



Additional classic games were added to Apple Arcade in April, including Fruit Ninja Classic, Monument Valley, and Cut the Rope Remastered.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

 *Well folks, today is the final day before next Wednesday’s expansion draft the Chuck and the rest of his NHL GM pals can make any moves, so perhaps something will happen. Otherwise, we wait til next week. And hope that Chuck is reflecting on what happened in the Vegas draft. [ProHockeyTalk]
*The Vegas expansion was a long time coming for the league, and the way they handled the organization’s entry into the game set a new benchmark for expansion going forward. Including, obviously, Seattle. [Yahoo Sports]
*We’re pack to the Q for pick number 26 in the BSH Community Draft. [BSH]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter is testing a new timeline layout in which photos are stretched to the edge of the display with no horizontal margins, mimicking the design layout of popular photo and video sharing apps, such as Instagram.





The new layout was shared by Jane Manchun Wong on Twitter, who often uncovers what features and changes Twitter is working on behind the scenes. The change is still in testing, but according to a screenshot shared by Wong, photos will now go edge-to-edge, compared to the current layout that features horizontal margins on either side of photos. 



Separately, while Twitter announced this week it would be shutting down "Fleets," its stories-like function in August, the company is possibly eyeing a possible new feature, the most wanted by users. 



In a tweet (via 9to5Mac), the company's product lead, Kayvon Beykpour, surveyed his followers as to whether they would subscribe to "Twitter Blue," the platform's monthly subscription service, if it offered users the ability to edit tweets for a few minutes after they were posted.




if @TwitterBlue let you edit tweets within a few minutes of posting them, would you want to subscribe? let me know why yes/no in the replies!
— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) July 16, 2021
 


While there is no say as to whether the ability to edit tweets will ever become a reality, the company's product lead survey is certainly telling that Twitter is once again exploring the idea and attempting to garner public opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of its global premiere next week, Apple today held a screening event for season two of the Apple TV+ hit comedy series "Ted Lasso" at the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles, and was attended by the cast and creators of the show, including Apple CEO Tim Cook.





"Ted Lasso" first aired last year as one of the first original series for the ‌Apple TV+‌ platform and has since grown in popularity. The second season of the show, which will consist of 12 episodes with an episode premiering every Friday, will premiere on ‌Apple TV+‌ on Friday, July 23. Even before its debut, Apple has already renewed the show for a third season, which the creators of the show have hinted may be the last.



This week "Ted Lasso" scored an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series, alongside 20 overall nominations. Jason Sudeikis, who plays Ted Lasso in the show, was also nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a Tonight Show appearance in 1978, Johnny Carson asked Carl Sagan about the scientific accuracy of Star Wars. Sagan replied:
The 11-year-old in me loved them but they could have made a better effort to to do things right. A lot of different aspects of things — Star Wars starts out saying it’s on some other galaxy and then you see there’s people. Starting in scene one there’s a problem, because human beings are the result of a unique evolutionary sequence based upon so many individually unlikely random events on the Earth.
In fact, I think most evolutionary biologists would agree that if you started the Earth out again and just let those random factors operate you might wind up with beings that are as smart as us and as ethical and artistic and all the rest, but they would not be human beings. That’s for the Earth. So in another planet, different environment, very unlikely to have a human being. It’s extremely unlikely that there would be creatures as similar to us as as the dominant ones in Star Wars.
And a whole bunch of other things: they’re all white. The skin of all the humans in Star Wars, oddly enough, is like this. And not even the other colors represented on the Earth at present, much less greens and blues and purples and oranges.


Carson pushes back slightly at this point: “They did have the scene of Star Wars with a lot of strange characters.” But Sagan persists:
Yeah, but none of them seem to be in charge of the galaxy. Everybody in charge of the galaxy seemed to look like us. And I thought it was a large amount of human chauvinism.


Sagan also complained about Han Solo’s boast of doing the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. According to the script, this was an “obvious” lie on Han’s part to make his ship sound impressive, so Sagan missed that. But then, post-Lucas, the Kessel Run was explained in Solo: A Star Wars Story as a distance shortcut and not an elapsed completion time, so…. (via digg)

It’s a perfect indie machine
 The newly announced Steam Deck is a tempting deal, especially for a product that starts at $399. But there’s one thing worth considering before pre-ordering your own, and that’s storage space. The $399 model comes with 64 GB of flash memory, which is a bit of a tight squeeze. Games shown in Valve’s promotional videos, like Control, at 42 GB, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (55 GB) would gobble up the majority of the drive. Doom Eternal and Death Stranding wouldn’t fit on the entry-level Steam Deck, due to their size. Each requires 80 GB of storage, according to their Steam pages.
The midrange $529 model has 256 GB of available storage and the $649 top-tier Deck has 512 GB available, solving that issue. Each could handle even the meatiest…]]></summary>

Blow up some ancient artifacts and sell them to traders
 Grinding Gear Games revealed Path of Exile’s latest expansion, Expedition, in a Thursday livestream. Co-founder Chris Wilson announced a host of changes coming to the game, with nearly 20 Skill and Support gems, a Flask rework, new items, the return of Path of Exile: Royale, and more. Grinding Gear Games will launch Path of Exile: Expedition on July 23.
The Expedition expansion adds a new activity where players bomb artifact sites for gear. Commissioned by the Kalguur, players will place traps along the ground to unearth loot and other artifacts. But these explosion also cause ancient Kalguur to rise from the grave and strike back. Players can also use explosives to blow through walls and find secrets, or pick up even better loot by unearthing treasure chests.
Once players have the artifacts, they can then haggle with the Kalguur for more loot. Players will need to balance getting a deal with not pissing of the NPC they’re trading with.
Grinding Gear Games is also making a lot of big changes with Expedition. Players will gain access to 19 new Skill and Support Gems. This will give players more ways to build their characters, even outside of the new Expedition mode. The studio will also rework the game’s Flask system, which previously forced players to slam their fingers on keys repeatedly. Before the change, some players even created homemade devices to help press multiple keys simultaneously, the developer said.
All of these additions also come with a host of nerfs, which may be divisive in the community. Grinding Gear Games is starting a new initiative to make Path of Exile more difficult, and it starts with changing the game’s balance.
Finally, the studio announced the return of Path of Exile: Royale, a battle royale mode inside the popular action game.]]></summary>

The hawk is hunting, floating on the wind searching for small prey, its head perfectly still while its body stabilizes around it. I could watch this clip on repeat for the rest of the day…so cool!

Don’t want SteamOS? You can get Windows instead
 Don’t actually want to play Steam games on your Steam Deck? That’s OK: Valve’s new handheld device isn’t a closed system — players can download other operating systems and game stores on the device.
Epic Games Store, uPlay, and Origin? All of those will work on the Steam Deck, if you wanted to play there, according to IGN.
Valve announced the handheld device on Thursday. The Nintendo Switch-like device will be available in December starting at $399. Basically, Steam Deck is described as a portable PC, with a bigger footprint than the Nintendo Switch — at least slightly. The screen is 7 inches, sandwiched by thumbsticks, a D-pad, and buttons. Trackpads are available on each side of the device, too, with eight triggers on…]]></summary>

Press F to pay respects
 Garrosh Hellscream is a strange character in the World of Warcraft lore. He rose to prominence during Cataclysm as the Horde’s Warchief, showed a few glimpses of being a noble and just leader, and then immediately took the train to villain town. Throughout Mists of Pandaria and Warlords of Draenor, he was one of the game’s central antagonists. He died in Draenor, and we thought we were rid of him — but Shadowlands seems to have gone ahead and made that final.
The position of Warchief is technically that of a politician, but Garrosh’s platform was mostly that he was super racist towards everyone who isn’t an orc. As a result of this and his other bad decisions, the players formed a raid to storm Orgrimmar. Garrosh was put on tr…]]></summary>

According to the OCU, Apple's iOS 14.5, iOS 14.5.1, and iOS 14.6 updates have "significantly damaged consumer devices" by "causing their processor speed to drop dramatically" and lowering battery life. As evidence, the OCU cites "numerous media outlets."



The OCU asked Apple to justify the "lack of performance" of the aforementioned ‌iPhone‌ models following the recent iOS updates, and said that the letter is intended to "initiate a dialog with Apple" in order to find the "best way to compensate consumers."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mophie today introduced a new 3-in-1 wireless charging stand, which is designed to work with Apple's MagSafe Charger, which is not included.





The 3-in-1 Stand for ‌MagSafe‌ Charger features a wireless charging pad designed for the AirPods or AirPods Pro, an Apple Watch charging puck, and an upright stand where a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger can be inserted.



Mophie is asking $90 for the 3-in-1 Stand for ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, but customers will also need to own a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, which is priced at $40, bringing the total price for this accessory to $130.





The 3-in-1 Stand for ‌MagSafe‌ is made from white plastic and a silver aluminum material, so it does match the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and there's a near seamless look. The Wireless Charging Stand has a cable for the ‌AirPods‌ charger and the Apple Watch Charger, but you will need a separate power adapter for the ‌MagSafe‌ cable.



Mophie's stand offers all of the benefits of ‌MagSafe‌, including support for landscape or portrait modes, magnetic attachment, easy placement and fitting, and 15W wireless charging (12W for the iPhone 12 mini).



The 3-in-1 Stand for ‌MagSafe‌ Charger can be purchased from Apple or from Mophie for $89.95.

With the ‌Apple TV‌ ‌Siri‌ Remote R5 Case, there's space to insert an AirTag at the back, which means that if you ever lose your remote, you can locate the AirTag that's inside with the ‌Find My‌ app.



Priced at $15, the Elago Remote R5 Case is made from a thick layer of what the company calls premium silicone, which is designed to protect the remote from drops and other damage.



Elago says that the design of the R5 was modeled after its previous cases, but with the added AirTag holder functionality. With this case, all buttons remain accessible, including the ‌Siri‌ button on the side, which is protected by a silicone cover.



The ‌Apple TV‌ ‌Siri‌ Remote R5 Case can be purchased from Amazon or from the Elago website for $14.99.

 The Steam Deck is a new handheld device from Valve for playing PC games on the go, the company announced Thursday. The Nintendo Switch-like device is set for release in December starting at $399.
Previously rumored as the “SteamPal,” the Steam Deck is a portable PC that’s slightly larger than the Nintendo Switch. It features a 7-inch touchscreen, two thumbsticks, a D-pad, and a four-button layout. There are also two trackpads — one on either side of the machine, under the thumbsticks — to allow for increased precision. The Steam Deck has eight triggers on its back: four on the device’s shoulders and four more where the ring and pinky fingers rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Fatshark/Games Workshop
    

  
Like everything else, Darktide is slipping to next year
 The developer of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the Left 4 Dead-like cooperative shooter set in the 40K universe, has delayed the game to spring 2022, according to an announcement posted Thursday to Twitter. Stockholm-based Fatshark said, in a familiar refrain, that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted its original plan to deliver Darktide later this year.
Marin Wahlund, founder and CEO of Fatshark, announced the delay on social media, explaining, “We have a responsibility to deliver the best game we possibly can, and frankly we need more time to accomplish this goal. It’s no secret that building a game during a pandemic is a challenge and we are not immune to this. We are planning to use the extra time to both focus on the level of quality at release, as well as invest in more systems to support Darktide for years to come.”


Warhammer 40,000: Darktide’s delay follows similar slips for 2021 games like Ghostwire: Tokyo and Resident Evil Re:Verse, which were announced earlier this week. Fatshark’s announcement means one less Left 4 Dead-like this year, making room for Back 4 Blood, Rainbow Six: Extraction, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite.
In Darktide, players will take on the role of a group of Imperial Guardsmen, the disposable grunts of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, under the direction of an Inquisitor. Inquisitors are secretive agents, known for rooting out heresy against the Emperor of mankind. As such, they regularly work with forces like the Imperial Guard on an ad-hoc basis. The setting is deep within a hive city, where zombielike creatures roam the halls committing untold gruesome acts.
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is coming to Windows PC and Xbox Series X, and will be included with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.]]></summary>

 Christopher Judge — who players will recognize as the voice of Kratos from God of War (2018) — will voice King T’Challa, aka the Black Panther, in Marvel’s Avengers’ War for Wakanda expansion. Entertainment Weekly broke the news of Judge’s casting on Thursday. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics will launch the War for Wakanda expansion, which will add Black Panther to Marvel’s Avengers’ playable roster, sometime this August.
According to Judge, the actor initially didn’t want to follow in the late Chadwick Boseman’s footsteps. “I turned it down straight away,” Judge told EW. “There’s many Black Panthers, but I really didn’t believe that anyone should ever do T’Challa again [after Bos…]]></summary>

Los Santos Tuners arrives July 20
 The next update to GTA Online is called Los Santos Tuners, and it is set to arrive on July 20, Rockstar Games announced Thursday. As you can probably guess from the title, this update is all about the “Auto” part of Grand Theft Auto.
Players who are into the social side of the game can go to the LS Car Meet, a new space for underground street racers. This is a venue where car aficionados can go without dealing with the chaos of a public server, a safe place where you can simply show off your stylish ride. There’s a test track that allows you to give your friend’s car a spin, and you can demo the game’s newest cars as well.
The LS Car Meet comes with new races, too. Some of them take place at the Car Meet, while others use the streets of Los Santos on a track. Of course, an update like this also wouldn’t be complete without new cars. These vehicles are designed to be highly customizable, and is scheduled to be released in two waves, so players can mix and match to create the perfect ride.
There are also illegal elements to the new arena, of course. Getaway drivers and fearless stunt riders will be able to pick up jobs that need a good, solid wheelman. For GTA$50,000, players can sign up to become a member, which unlocks a new progression track called Reputation. Level up your Reputation, and you can get new benefits and rewards, like unique tattoos and merch.
Ten new cars will drop on July 20, with an additional seven dropping over the rest of the summer. When GTA Online launches for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, some of these vehicles will be eligible for special improvements — only for people who are playing on those consoles, which will give them a nice edge.
Players can expect more content this summer. Rockstar teased a look at “Contracts” for new robberies that require some talented driving to pull off.]]></summary>

 We’re nearing the home stretch here folks, and would you look at that! We’re heading back to the QMJHL for the third time this week!
Next up on the draft board is Xavier Bourgault, who, because of his early birthday, has just wrapped up his third season in the QMJHL, and it was quite a productive one at that! Putting up a cool 40 points in 29 games, Bourgault came in third in scoring on his team, and flashed a very intriguing offensive toolkit in the process. 
As was the case with Zachary Bolduc when we talked about him a few days ago, Bourgault is a natural center who has spent much of his QMJHL career playing on the wing. This makes his projection a little trickier, but hey, we could also spin that a little more positively as just being positional flexibility. Sure? …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that it will begin mass production operations at its new factory in Arizona in 2024, Nikkei Asia reports.





TSMC Chairman Mark Liu announced that the company's $12 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona, which is currently under construction, will begin mass production in the first quarter of 2024. While the 2024 timeframe had previously been rumored by Bloomberg, TSMC's announcement serves as a confirmation and indicates that the project is on track.



The first batch of engineers hired to staff the new U.S. factory arrived in Taiwan in late April this year for training, and the company is looking to accelerate its schedule for the facility as much as possible. 



The facility will mass-produce chips fabricated with a 5nm process. TSMC has been gradually miniaturizing its process over the years, going from a 16nm A10 chip in iPhone 7 models, to a 7nm A13 chip in iPhone 11 models, and most recently a 5nm process for the iPhone 12's A14 chip. Likely clients for the chips made in the Arizona factory include Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple. The new Arizona plant will make it theoretically possible for Apple's 5nm custom silicon chips, such as the A14 or M1 chip, to be manufactured within the United States.



TSMC's main factories are located in Taiwan, but it already operates a factory in Camas, Washington, as well as design centers in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California, meaning that the Arizona facility will be its second manufacturing site in the United States. 



Alongside the news about the Arizona factory, TSMC also said that it was looking into chip production sites in Japan, likely for chips destined for Sony devices, and set out the intention to build up overseas manufacturing capacity to ensure long-term competitiveness.

Free-to-play FPS Gundam Evolution is coming to PC  
 Gundam Evolution is a new first-person shooter set in the world of Mobile Suit Gundam. Two teams of six players square off in arenas where they fight to capture points using special abilities — and the occasional ultimate ability — as famous mobile suits. And yeah, after watching the debut trailer for Gundam Evolution, this really does look like Overwatch.
It’s not just the game structure; Gundam Evolution follows the hero-shooter formula for sure. It’s also the interface, which is nearly identical to Blizzard’s UI for Overwatch (and Overwatch 2). That’s excusable — it’s a clean, easy-to-parse interface. The good stuff is blue, the bad stuff is red, and I know exactly where to look to check my cooldowns and ultimate ability meter.
Gundam Evolution will have three game modes, according to its official website: Point Capture, in which teams fight for control over spots on the map; Domination, where teams vie to capture one of three randomly available points; and Destruction, where one team is tasked with destroying an object while the other attempts to protect it. So far, there is no payload-delivery mode ... perhaps a smart admission that no one ever wants to be on the payload.
Publisher Bandai Namco says Gundam Evolution will be free to play when it’s released on Windows PC. A Japanese release is confirmed, but there’s no word yet on a Western localization.
It’s a big week for Gundam games. Bandai Namco announced Wednesday that Super Robot Wars 30, the mecha anime mashup role-playing game series, is headed to the West, featuring giant mechs and robots from Mobile Suit Gundam, Mazinger, Getter Robo, SSSS.Gridman, and other series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest research from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) shows that all four iPhone 12 models accounted for 63% of total iPhone sales in the United States in the quarter ending June 2021.





The highest-end iPhone 12 Pro Max tied with the year-old iPhone 11 for the largest share of any single model at 23%, while the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone XR had the smallest share, each at 5%, according to CIRP. As pandemic-related restrictions ease in the United States, the Chicago-based research firm said increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models.



"Apple did very well as it emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic," said Josh Lowitz, a CIRP co-founder. "Increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models as they retired older phones and shopped more at Apple's own retail locations to buy those iPhones."





The shift to more expensive models resulted in the iPhone's average selling price in the United States rising to $869 in the June 2021 quarter, added Lowitz.



The research note also indicates that Apple experienced a significant increase in iPhone sales through its retail operations, including both physical stores and online. In the June 2021 quarter, 27% of iPhone sales in the United States were completed through Apple, compared to a previous high of 21% in September 2020, according to CIRP.



CIRP bases its findings on its survey of 500 customers in the United States who purchased an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch in the April-June 2021 period.

But his video is also an essay on seeing, in the deeper sense of the word — seeing and being seen, recognition and understanding, sensitivity and compassion, the stuff of meaningful human connection.
In a society that does a lousy job of accommodating the disabled, Mr. Robinson appeals for more acceptance of people who are commonly perceived as different or not normal.
“I don’t have a problem with the way that I see,” he says. “My only problem is with the way that I’m seen.”

An investigation by the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee into music streaming found that artists see "pitiful returns."



The committee called for a "complete reset" of the market in the UK, with artists being given a "fair share" of record label earnings from streaming. All of the money streaming services currently pay goes to rights-holders, who then pass on a small share to artists. Labels and publishers currently keep the vast majority of profits.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Chuck’s presser the other day, remember that? Meltzer pulled out the important bits in case you needed Spark Notes. [Flyers]
*And to really break it down, brilliantly of course, is Charlie over at The Athletic. He puts the whole thing into words we can all understand. [The Athletic]
*We are now less than a week away from the expansion draft, so here’s a little primer, or a little refresher, depending on where you are in your journey. [Inquirer]
*The SB Nation mock draft has been going on these last couple of weeks and when it came time for Broad Street Hockey to put on their Chuck Fletcher hats and make a pick? We did the damn thing. [BSH]
*Speaking of mock drafts, the Community Draft Board is reaching the end of the first round, and for the 25th overall you folks took things to Sweden. [BSH]
*As we’ve seen over the last few days, the approach to improvement some NHL GMs are taking to kick off the summer is to move on from the past. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Speaking of moving on, maybe Seattle will take Robert Hagg? [BSH]
*Vladimir Tarasenko has a ten-team trade list and your Flyers are on it. [BSH]
*With the draft getting so close, it’s possible player trades are going to have to get going just so teams are well-situated when Ron Francis comes knocking. [Sports Illustrated]
*If you’re new to the game or just want to try and learn a little more about what the nerds are talking about, these stats primers are always a big help. It’s always fun to learn something, gain some new perspectives, these kinds of things. [Winging It In Motown]
*The Minnesota Wild got a dog. GET A DOG, THE FLYERS!! [Hockey Wilderness]
*And finally, it’s been a long year and we’ve been dying to do this... the Broad Street Hockey Draft Party is BACK. Details here and on today’s BSH Radio later this afternoon. It’ll be so much fun to be in a room full of Flyers fans having fun together. Come if you can! [BSH]]]></summary>

In the release notes for the updated iOS 15 and watchOS 8 betas, Apple says that software updates can now be downloaded and installed on devices even if they have as little as 500MB of storage left.

You can now update your device using Software Update if less than 500 MB of storage is available
Apple doesn't provide any context to the new change; however, it is likely targeted at users of the older Apple Watch Series 3. Owners of the older Apple Watch currently have to face an unpleasant experience when updating their device to newer versions of watchOS, including resetting and repairing their watch to their iPhone due to little available storage. Apple is aiming to address these and other concerns with ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌watchOS 8‌ this fall.



The third beta of ‌iOS 15‌ also includes plenty of other changes, including refinements to the controversial Safari design, with a relocated address field. Check out our roundup to see everything that's new in the latest beta.

The disgruntled St. Louis Blues winger would approve of a trade to Philadelphia.
 After the St. Louis Blues won the Stanley Cup in 2019, they have been waddling their way into mediocrity and a grander sense of non-existence in the larger scope of the NHL. They did the thing and it was nice and emotional, but since then it’s been just shedding some contracts and trying to stay at least somewhat competitive with the talent they have locked up there.
Most recently, former All-Star winger Vladimir Tarasenko wants his way out of St. Louis and it’s no secret — like, at all. He has gone through some hellish injuries and just wants a brand new start in a new organization that isn’t riddled with some medical complaints, like requiring to do a sec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rene Ritchie:
At WWDC 2021, Apple unveiled new interface designs for Safari on
Mac, iPad, and iPhone. They’re all radical but none as
in-your-face radical as the iOS 15 version for the iPhone, which
pulls the address bar to the bottom and hides a ton of controls
behind a menu-hamburger button.
We recorded this before today’s release of the third developer betas for iOS 15 and MacOS 12 Monterey, but it all holds up. The good news is that today’s betas show that Apple has taken criticism of the new Safari UI designs seriously — on MacOS, Safari once again defaults to showing the tab bar as a discrete UI element in the window, with one URL address bar. (Similar changes are coming for iPadOS, but didn’t make it for today’s beta.) The iOS changes today aren’t as significant, but, having talked to folks at Apple, there are a lot of changes and refinements still to come as summer progresses. I feel good about what I’ve heard.
(Something I missed in my critique of the Safari 15 betas two weeks ago: you can long-press on the domain name to the left of the “···” button in the floating toolbar to bring up a contextual menu. That contextual menu contains a Share item, and today’s beta 3 adds a Reload item (screenshot). I still say Share and Reload are both important enough that they should be exposed as top-level buttons, but knowing that this long-press menu exists is a great tip if you’re already using the betas.)

Netflix has hired former Electronic Arts and Facebook executive Mike Verdu as vice president of game development, and he will report to Netflix chief operating officer Greg Peters. At Facebook, Verdu worked with developers to bring games and other content to the Oculus VR headset.



It is not clear how Netflix's gaming offering will work nor if the company plans to develop original gaming content. Netflix could have a cloud gaming setup similar to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, or it could work with developers on original titles, making it more similar to Apple Arcade.



Netflix's gaming efforts are in the very early stages and Netflix's plans for gaming will become more clear in the future.



With ‌Apple Arcade‌, Apple makes mobile games available on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and the Apple TV, with ‌Apple TV‌ integration allowing people to play on their television sets similar to traditional consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s new short fiction from Sally Rooney in the New Yorker: Unread Messages.
For the rest of the afternoon in the office, the woman worked on the same text-editing interface, moving apostrophes and deleting commas. After closing one file and before opening another, she routinely checked her social-media feeds. Her expression, her posture, did not vary depending on the information she encountered there: a news report about a horrific natural disaster, a photograph of someone’s beloved pet, a female journalist speaking out about death threats, a recondite joke requiring familiarity with several other previous Internet jokes in order to be even vaguely comprehensible, a passionate condemnation of white supremacy, or a promoted tweet advertising a health supplement for expectant mothers. Nothing changed in her outward relationship to the world that would allow an observer to determine what she felt about what she saw. Then, after some length of time, with no apparent trigger, she closed the browser window and reopened the text editor. Occasionally one of her colleagues would interject with a work-related question and she would answer, or someone would share a funny anecdote with the office and they would all laugh, but mostly the work continued quietly.


Per an interview with Rooney, the piece is excerpted from her next novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, due out in September and eagerly anticipated in this household.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tom Krazit, reporting for Protocol on July 2:
IBM President Jim Whitehurst is stepping down from the No. 2
leadership position at the company less than three years after IBM
acquired his former company, in just one of several leadership
changes announced Friday.
Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of global
markets, will also leave the company, said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna
in a press release right before the three-day holiday
weekend. Rob Thomas, who has led IBM’s Watson initiative in the
past, will become the new senior vice president of global markets.
Did you catch this story 12 days ago? I almost didn’t. IBM is still a very big company — #42 on the current Fortune 500 list — but they’re just not relevant in the way they used to be, or the way today’s big 5 tech companies are.
It wasn’t too long ago — 20, 25 years? — when a leadership story like this at IBM would have been all anyone in tech talked about for weeks to come. They’ve been diminished not because the government broke them up or curbed their behavior through regulations, but simply because they faded away. It is extremely difficult to become dominant in tech, but it’s just as difficult to stay dominant for longer than a short run.
I don’t offer this observation as an argument against any and all regulation and antitrust investigations of big tech companies. I’m simply arguing that regulation and antitrust lawsuits should be wielded with surgical precision, not broad strokes. Competition and progress work.

        <id>https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/elevationlab-magbase-magsafe-charger-accessory/</id>
        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/elevationlab-magbase-magsafe-charger-accessory/"/>
        <updated>2021-07-14T21:21:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ElevationLab, known for its range of useful accessories for Apple's devices, today introduced the MagBase, which is designed to increase the functionality of Apple's MagSafe Charger.





Priced at $9.95, the MagBase is a small attachment that fits onto the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger. It has a micro air suction surface at the bottom, which ElevationLab has used in prior products. This micro air suction is not adhesive, but it's quite strong and is able to keep the MagBase securely attached to a desk or a table.



The MagBase has multiple functions when used with a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger. If you pull upwards on an iPhone that's on the MagBase, the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌MagSafe‌ charger will come up, which is useful if you need to check something while still continuing to charge. When you're done, it can be set right back in the MagBase.





If you want to pick up the ‌iPhone‌ and leave the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger attached to the MagBase, you can use a quick slide gesture to remove the ‌iPhone‌, which leaves the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger right where it is.



The design of the MagBase adds on an additional 3-ft USB-C cord that attaches to the USB-C end of the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, so you have more cord to work with when using it at a desk. It increases the length of the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger cable from three feet to six feet.





Because the MagBase is barely larger than the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, it takes up minimal space while on a desk while also providing a useful and versatile base for housing it.



The MagBase can be purchased from the ElevationLab website for $9.95.

        <link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"/>
        <updated>2021-07-14T21:19:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook owns a data analytics service called CrowdTangle. CrowdTangle allows journalists and researchers to examine and study the “engagement” of link posts on Facebook. NYT columnist Kevin Roose has been using CrowdTangle’s engagement data to publish the excellent @FacebooksTop10 account on Twitter, which lists the 10 top-performing posts on Facebook every day. Unsurprisingly, most days, the list is dominated by right-wing commentators.
Roose today has a long column — incredibly well-sourced — that digs into Facebook’s response to this imbroglio, which, unsurprisingly, has been to treat it as a perception problem rather than a product problem:
Mr. Zuckerberg is right about one thing: Facebook is not a giant
right-wing echo chamber.
But it does contain a giant right-wing echo chamber — a kind of
AM talk radio built into the heart of Facebook’s news ecosystem,
with a hyper-engaged audience of loyal partisans who love liking,
sharing and clicking on posts from right-wing pages, many of which
have gotten good at serving up Facebook-optimized outrage bait at
a consistent clip.
CrowdTangle’s data made this echo chamber easier for outsiders to
see and quantify. But it didn’t create it, or give it the tools it
needed to grow — Facebook did — and blaming a data tool for
these revelations makes no more sense than blaming a thermometer
for bad weather.

Launched last November, the AX4200 is Linksys' latest flagship WiFi mesh system, offering up WiFi 6 connectivity at an affordable price.



‌HomeKit‌ support in the Linksys Velop AX4200 allows it to be managed through the Home app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The Home app offers up options to define how HomeKit-connected routers are able to communicate within the home and over the internet.



‌HomeKit‌ users can opt to firewall off ‌HomeKit‌ accessories to prevent them from communicating with other WiFi devices on a home network and untrusted internet services, putting a stop to hacking attempts and providing better security for connected home devices.



The Linksys Velop AX4200 Mesh System with one node is available for $250, while the AX4200 with three nodes is available for $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the third developer beta of macOS Monterey, which came out this morning, Apple has overhauled the design of Safari, making the tab bar more similar to the current tab bar in macOS Big Sur.





The prior Safari design did away with the dedicated URL and search interface, instead allowing any individual tab to be used for navigation input. Tabs were also all arranged at the top of the display to minimize the space taken up at the top of a Safari window.



In ‌macOS Monterey‌, Apple has walked this back. There's a dedicated URL/search bar at the top of the Safari window, with the tabs arranged below it. Clicking on a tab makes it the active window and it's easier to drag tabs for rearranging or opening in a new window.



It's still quite far off from the current Safari design in ‌macOS Big Sur‌, but it's certainly an improvement over the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ design.



The new and separate tab bar is enabled by default when upgrading to ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta three, but Apple has included an option to revert to the original Monterey design. If you to go View and toggle off "Show Separate Tab Bar," you can use the original design.



‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 3 also appears to lay the groundwork for Universal Control. Under System Preferences -> Displays -> Add Display -> Advanced, there are now preferences that can be selected for the Universal Control feature. 





Unfortunately, Universal Control is not functional and we'll have to wait for a later beta to experience a working version.

In our first event since 2019, we celebrate.
 Covid can’t stop us! Ok, yes it can, and it did, but we’re back with another Broad Street Hockey event! We are hosting our 2021 NHL Entry Draft Party at Xfinity Live — specifically Bullies Pub — on Friday July 23rd beginning at 6pm.
The reason we selected Bullies is obviously because of the strong Flyers connection, but also because they have both indoor and outdoor spaces for those who aren’t comfortable with indoor events. We are expecting a few hundred people, so please keep that in mind if you are unvaccinated or uncomfortable with groups. We will follow all of the Philadelphia guidelines for safety, please review them here, and encourage you to wear a mask.
There is a Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park on the same evening, so if you are driving, you will have to pay for parking until 8:05pm. If you are taking public transportation, factor crowds into your timing. 
Xfinitylive.com
  
The kitchens will not be open within Bullies Pub, but Xfinity Live does offer Chickies & Petes, Geno’s, and Lorenzo’s stalls and those will be available to us. 
Whether you like the Flyers right now or not, whether they actually make the pick at 13 or not, we will be there. This is the first opportunity since Festivus in 2019 for us to all get together and boo the commissioner and maybe Chuck Fletcher too. You don’t even have to be a Flyers fan to attend! We accept all boos from all fans.
When: Friday July 23, beginning at 6pm
Where: Bullies Pub inside Xfinity Live
Who: Broad Street Hockey fans and friends
We’re really looking forward to seeing you all, even in this uninspiring draft year and with this mediocre team.]]></summary>

We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining
the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets
were mainly used by those Tweeting the most.
So now we’re ready to explore other ways for people to share on
Twitter.
The @Twitter account put it better:
we’re removing Fleets on August 3, working on some new stuff
we’re sorry or you’re welcome
I’ll resist dunking on Twitter for this, because I think it’s better for Twitter to try more new ideas — even if many wind up abandoned — than to find itself paralyzed by indecision over how to evolve the platform. Fleets were a fine experiment because, other than taking up a bit of screen real estate at the very top, they didn’t interfere with Twitter’s core features.
(The above encapsulates my thinking on the filibuster in the U.S. Senate. It’d be better to abolish it and let the party in power pass its agenda by a simple majority, even knowing that eventually the other party will be in power, and they’ll do things you don’t like. Let the majority pass its agenda, and if they’re good ideas, they’ll prove popular, and if they’re not, they won’t. Fear of letting the other side achieve its goals when they’re in the majority has resulted in a legislature that can barely pass anything — and that hasn’t worked out well.)

Currently available in Early Access
 Early access title Dread Hunger is a little like Among Us, but mixed together with a doomed Arctic voyage and dark magic. The game is currently in early access, but will launch as a full release in the fall.
In a match of Dread Hunger, eight explorers take off on a 19th century Arctic exploration. There’s just one problem: two of them are Thralls, and they want to make sure everyone dies in the icy coldness. That’s bad! The explorers have to work as a team, repairing their ship and pushing forward through the harsh climate before they are eliminated by sneaky Thralls. There’s also voice chat built in, which adds a fun role-play element — it’s like getting to star in The Terror.
Thralls also have more tools to sabotage the expedition than your average impostor. They can poison food, detonate explosives on the ship, and even cast dark rituals. There are also external threats, like wolves and cannibals. Don’t worry though. If things get too grim, you can absolutely eat your fellow explorers for a quick pick me up.
The newest update is called The Great Hunt, and it brings a new map called the Summit, a deadly polar bear, and a character called the Hunter who uses a bow.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an animation of how quickly an object falls 1 km to the surfaces of solar system objects like the Earth, Sun, Ceres, Jupiter, the Moon, and Pluto. For instance, it takes 14.3 seconds to cover that distance on Earth and 13.8 seconds on Saturn.
It might be surprising to see large planets have a pull comparable to smaller ones at the surface, for example Uranus pulls the ball down slower than at Earth! Why? Because the low average density of Uranus puts the surface far away from the majority of the mass. Similarly, Mars is nearly twice the mass of Mercury, but you can see the surface gravity is actually the same… this indicates that Mercury is much denser than Mars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter in November debuted a new ephemeral tweet option called "Fleets," with the feature designed to compete with Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories, Snapchat, and more.





Fleets apparently did not catch on, because Twitter today announced that Fleets are being discontinued as of August 3, which is less than a year after the feature launched.



Twitter says that it had hoped Fleets would help people "feel more comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter," but there hasn't been an increase of people joining Twitter with Fleets as Twitter expected.
We're evolving what Twitter is, and trying bigger, bolder things to serve the public conversation. A number of these updates, like Fleets, are speculative and won't work out. We'll be rigorous, evaluate what works, and know when to move on and focus elsewhere. If we're not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while - we're not taking big enough chances. We'll continue to build new ways to participate in conversations, listening to feedback and changing direction when there may be a better way to serve people using Twitter.
Going forward, Twitter says that it will use what it learned from Fleets to focus on creating other ways for people to "join the conversation" and will find new ways to address "what holds people back from participating on Twitter."



Twitter also plans to test updates to the Tweet composer and camera that will incorporate Fleets features like text formatting, full screen camera for photo taking, and GIF stickers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's AirPlay 2 and HomeKit features have been rolling out to a number of smart TVs, and as of today, the functionality is available on 2020 Toshiba and Insignia 4K UHD Smart Fire TVs.





‌AirPlay‌ 2 is designed to allow iPhone, iPad, and Mac users to stream content to an AirPlay-compatible device, and with built-in support in Toshiba and Insignia TVs, an Apple TV is not required to use ‌AirPlay‌ 2.



‌AirPlay‌ 2 also works across multiple devices for a whole home audio experience, and can be used for streaming TV shows, music, photos, and more to the television set.



With ‌HomeKit‌, smart TV owners can control their television through Siri voice commands or through the Home app on ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, or Mac. ‌Siri‌ and the Home app can be used to turn the TV on or off, adjust the volume, and switch the TV input to another device.



To use ‌HomeKit‌, the TV needs to be added as a ‌HomeKit‌ accessory, which can be done by going to the Settings menu on the TV, selecting Display and Sounds, and choosing the ‌AirPlay‌ and ‌HomeKit‌ option. From there, instructions are available on the setup process.



‌AirPlay‌ and ‌HomeKit‌ are available on the Toshiba 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Dolby Vision (2020 model) and the Insignia 4K UHD Smart Fire TV (2020 model).

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there's a new "For All of You" recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound, and if you have HomeKit cameras, you can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

The developer has taken a few wrong turns
 I’ve been a fan of Blizzard games since I was a kid. I love the pulp and drama of their settings, the polished cinematics and bold characters. But over the past few years, I’ve become frustrated. Part of this is almost certainly that I’m getting older and less patient, but a big part of it comes from the games themselves. 
World of Warcraft: Shadowlands is a narrative mess that recently culminated in a big reveal centering around split souls, rewriting reality, and villain monologuing. Overwatch, on the other hand, is stuck in the past — we won’t get to see the actual Overwatch organization in action until Overwatch 2, which currently does not have a release date. 
Both settings have a comic book-y vibe, bigg…]]></summary>

Plus new maps and a new gun
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s new midseason update is here, but it might be a little smaller than most players expect. After some substantial updates in the last couple of patches, Treyarch has decided to take a slower approach this time around, keeping most of its balance changes limited to Zombies mode and letting the new content be the star of the show. 
Even the Zombies changes aren’t that sweeping, but they do give a boost to two of the mode’s most overlooked weapon types: melee weapons and sniper rifles. Melee weapons now do 2,500 damage instead of 2,000, and their level 3 Pack-a-Punch upgrades do five times more damage instead of four. Meanwhile, five different sniper rifles had various buffs to attributes like cr…]]></summary>

DICE gets into the nitty-gritty details about this year’s Battlefield
 Battlefield 2042 will include cross-platform play between PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts confirmed Wednesday. Players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms will also be able to play against each other, but given the maximum player-count difference (64 players vs. 128 players) between last-gen and current-gen consoles, cross-generation play will not be included in this year’s Battlefield.
In a blog post, DICE also confirmed that players on PC and consoles can opt out of playing against each other, addressing concerns about skill differences between mouse and keyboard and gamepad players.
DICE says it will test out cross-play functionality during Battlefield 2042’s technical play test, which was scheduled to go live sometime in July, but has since been delayed to “later this summer.”
Players who expect to play across multiple platforms also got some good news today: DICE says it’s building cross-progression and cross-commerce for Battlefield 2042, which will be shared across all platforms. “Your unlocked progress and purchases in your PlayStation copy of the game will carry over onto the Xbox or PC version, and vice versa,” DICE said.
More details about Battlefield 2042’s gameplay changes are available at the game’s official website.
Battlefield 2042 was unveiled in June, promising massive maps for up to 128 players, real-time destructive weather, and near-future weapons of war. At E3 2021, EA and DICE showed off gameplay from the first-person shooter. Battlefield 2042 is bound for PS4, PS5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.]]></summary>

 Today, we move away from the QMJHL, and across the ocean to Sweden where we’ll take a look at another European prospect. Simon Robertsson is a big bodied RW (6’0”, 190 lbs) who uses his strength to his advantage well in all three zones, and has one of the hardest shots in the entire draft. He’s played well at the U20 level, scoring 50 points in 56 games across the last two seasons at that level. Therefore, naturally, he was called up beginning in 2019-20 to the SHL club, where he hasn’t been able to replicate the success he found before, but not everyone can succeed against men right away.
Though, Robertsson’s fundamentals were solid regardless, and all signs point to him being able to break through in 2021-22.

3G services offered by EE, BT Mobile, and Plusnet will be phased out by 2023, by which time the company will have built a new 5G core network. 3G usage has been in steady decline in recent years, now representing less than two percent of all data traffic over the EE network. The legacy 3G spectrum will be used to enhance 5G capacity in the future.



By the mid-2020s, BT will fully integrate fiber, Wi-Fi, and mobile network infrastructure for more secure and reliable connectivity. This will be "the UK's first fully converged network," which will allow BT to build next-generation fiber and 5G networks simultaneously.…]]></summary>

 Our look at possible targets for the Seattle Kraken in this month’s expansion draft began with James van Riemsdyk, continued with a defensive option in Shayne Gostisbehere, and today chugs along by dissecting a significantly less costly option for the NHL’s newest club.

In partnership with the California Housing Finance Agency, Housing Trust Silicon Valley, and Destination:Home, Apple said the the $1 billion in funding has helped support new housing development and construction, assisted first-time buyers to purchase homes, and expanded programs to reduce homelessness.



This milestone is part of Apple's overall $2.5 billion commitment to combat the California housing crisis, with the state having some of the United States' most expensive residential markets, including the Bay Area where Apple is headquartered. To date, Apple says it has supported affordable housing efforts across 25 counties in the state.



Apple's commitment includes a series of initiatives over several years, including a $1 billion affordable housing investment fund with the state of California, a $1 billion first-time homebuyer mortgage assistance fund, $300 million in Apple-owned land made available for affordable housing, a $150 million Bay Area housing fund, and $50 million to support Destination: Home's efforts to address homelessness in Silicon Valley.

Why use a first-round draft pick when you can just simply have Matt Dumba instead?
 With the No. 13 pick of the annual SB Nation NHL Mock Draft, the Philadelphia Flyers select...
Nobody!
Because they traded their first-round pick, along with prospect Elliot Desnoyers, to the Minnesota Wild for defenseman Matt Dumba! Surprise!
It’s no secret that the Flyers desperately need to improve defensively this offseason. And while another year of experience could be what some of their young blueliners need, this isn’t the offseason to take a “wait and see” approach. The Flyers need immediate improvements from their defensemen, and the best way to help accelerate that process is by acquiring a veteran NHLer with a proven track record of success.

MacRumors concept render


According to a new report from The Elec, Google is just one of several mobile makers seeking to secure UTG orders from Samsung, which is currently the exclusive supplier of the glass. Xiaomi, Honor, and OPPO are all believed to be working on foldable phones with UTG.



Samsung's original 2019 Galaxy Fold used polyimide films, but the out-folding screens were susceptible to display creasing and panel breakages, and the company's subsequent (in-)folding smartphones, 2020's Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Z Fold 2, both used UTG. T…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is rolling out end-to-end encryption for video captured by Ring doorbells, after a successful trial in the United States (via BBC News). 





Amazon's worldwide adoption of the encryption standard for Ring will mean that video footage from the doorbell cameras is stored on Amazon's servers, but the content won't be accessible to the company and only the user's device on which the video is received will be able to view the files. 



Other new security features also set to be added to Ring doorbells include the ability to use two-factor authenticator apps and Captcha images. Amazon bought the US-based firm Ring for around $1 billion in 2018.



Apple offers a similar service for HomeKit-enabled third-party cameras called HomeKit Secure Video, which leverages iCloud to securely stream and store video clips from compatible indoor and outdoor cameras and doorbells, with end-to-end encryption. 



HomeKit Secure Video cameras and doorbells are managed through the Home app like other HomeKit accessories. However, despite assurances given in 2018 Amazon's Ring Video Doorbell still does not support Apple ‌HomeKit‌, and there is no indication that it plans to do so in the near future. 



For people looking for alternatives, Apple in December began selling Logitech's Circle View Wired Doorbell ($200), one of the first video doorbells with support for ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌.



Starting with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, which will be publicly released in September, security cameras and video doorbells that support ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ will detect and notify you when a package has been delivered.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Chuck Fletcher and the Flyers called a press conference yesterday to talk about... well, nothing, really. Talked a bit about the expansion draft, vaguely. [Inquirer]
*Specifically mentioned he’s willing to trade this year’s first round pick. Which is good. [Inquirer]
*Speaking of moves to be made, Charlie looks at the idea of moving on from Jake Voracek. Seems to be the hot topic of conversation these last few days. [The Athletic]
*We’re up to No. 24 on the Community Draft Board and you all have selected another player from the Q. [BSH]
*There were a couple of surprises yesterday, most notably that the Minnesota Wild decided to buy out both Ryan Suter AND Zach Parise. Very interesting approach. [Hockey Wilderness]
*So... Ryan Suter? Maybe? Chuck? It’s not the worst idea. [BSH]
*The other surprise yesterday was Pekka Rinne’s announcement that he’s calling it a career. Shame that dude never got a Cup. [On The Forecheck]
*And finally, in the latest mock up of the very-quickly-approaching expansion draft, the Kraken are once again predicted to do the Flyers a bit of a favor. Here’s hoping. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has brought in 60-minute group video call limits for Google Meet users with free Gmail accounts, according to recently updated support pages (via 9to5Google).





The Meet service was originally exclusive to paying G-Suite members, but "unlimited" (up to 24 hour) group calls were made available for free to all users with a Google account in April 2020, in order to see off competition from Zoom and to help mitigate the impact of the global health crisis on work and relationship patterns.



The 60-minute limit was originally scheduled to come back into effect at the end of September 2020, but Google moved the deadline to March 2021, and then again to June 30, in response to changing circumstances. 



Google will continue to allow non-paying users to make one-on-one calls for as long as they want, but longer group calls will require the $7.99 monthly cost of a Google Workspace subscription for individuals. 



Going forward, free Gmail account holders will get a notification at 55 minutes that their Meet group call is about to end. To extend the call, the host can upgrade their Google account. Otherwise, the call will end at 60 minutes.



Google Meet offers many of the features that have made Zoom and Microsoft Teams so popular with both business and non-business users over the last year, including video conferencing for up to 100 participants, the option to schedule meetings, and screen-sharing capabilities.



Anyone interested in using Google Meet can download the Meet iOS app from the App Store or head to meet.google.com to use the web browser version.

Netflix’s The Crown and the Disney+ Star Wars drama The
Mandalorian led the way with 24 nominations each. HBO led all the
networks with 130 nominations.
Apple TV+ did well, too, with 34 total nominations, led, no surprise, by the delightful Ted Lasso. Maybe Apple TV+ isn’t the new HBO but just a new HBO. Just a lot of good stuff from these premium platforms last year. We loved HBO’s Mare of Easttown, which was justly rewarded with numerous nominations. I still think the HBO Max branding is off — just call the damn thing “HBO” — but HBO is holding its own in its decade-old race to become Netflix before Netflix can become HBO. They’re both in good shape.
What’s shocking now isn’t that premium streaming services do well with Emmy nominations, but that traditional network scripted shows — comedy and drama — are nearly shut out. All the best shows now are on the new streaming platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A24, a film and TV studio that works with Apple, recently explored a possible sale and Apple was one of the interested parties, according to a new report from Variety.





Movies that include "Hereditary," "Moonlight," "Lady Bird," and "Midsommar" have come from A24, with A24 also responsible for Apple TV+ content that includes "Mr. Corman" and "On the Rocks" along with and upcoming films "Sharper," "The Sky is Everywhere," "The Tragedy of Macbeth," "Bride," and more.



A24 is asking for $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and has been talking with potential buyers for over 18 months. According to Variety, it is not clear if those discussions are ongoing, as a source close to the company says A24 is now focused on expansion.



Some of the sources that spoke to Variety said that Apple and A24 discussed a potential acquisition when their multi-year film deal was announced in 2018, but other sources said that the two companies held discussions much more recently.



Apple appears to be looking to expand its ‌Apple TV+‌ offerings, and recent rumors also suggested that Apple has expressed interest in purchasing Hello Sunshine, which is Reese Witherspoon's production company.



If Apple does ultimately end up purchasing A24, it could be folded into Apple Studios, Apple's own production company that is involved with some of its ‌Apple TV+‌ shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack designed for the iPhone 12 models has a unique feature that's long been rumored but never introduced in an Apple product -- reverse wireless charging. 





When attached to an iPhone that's charging via Lightning, the ‌iPhone‌ can deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which is the first instance of an ‌iPhone‌ being able to route power to an accessory device. 



We've long heard rumors of reverse wireless charging capabilities for the ‌iPhone‌, a feature that's been talked about as a possibility for both the iPhone 11 and the ‌iPhone 12‌. Apple hasn't actually implemented reverse wireless charging until now, and the way that it works with the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is limited in scope.



With the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, the ‌iPhone‌ has to be plugged in for the charging feature to work, but it's certainly a step in the right direction and hints at more expansive reverse wireless charging capabilities in the future. Given the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌'s reverse wireless charging feature, it seems technically possible that an ‌iPhone 12‌ could deliver power to the AirPods or AirPods Pro, but Apple has not yet implemented this feature. 



Apple has suggested that ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ users might want to use the ‌iPhone‌ passthrough charging feature when the ‌iPhone‌ is connected to a power source like wired CarPlay and is able to charge both accessories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New weather app for the iPhone and iPad (and, on Apple Silicon Macs, MacOS — thanks to their ability to run iPad apps) from data visualization researcher Robin Stewart. I’ve never seen weather forecasts presented quite like this. A very glanceable presentation of precipitation chances, cloud cover, and, of course, temperature. (Weather Strip cleverly only shows the “feels like” temperature when it differs from the actual temperature by at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit. The biggest downside is that it’s U.S.-only:
Weather Strip forecasts come directly from the U.S. National
Weather Service (NOAA), so the app is currently limited to the
United States. Forecasts usually span 168 hours (7 days) but can
occasionally be longer or shorter.
Just $1/month, or a mere $4/year. Insta-buy for me at that annual rate — and there’s a one-month trial period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a little late in the annual iPhone cycle — we might learn about this year’s new iPhones in two months — but presumably this battery pack will work with MagSafe-compatible iPhones for a few years to come. (Mark Gurman first wrote about this product back in February.)
The closest competitor is probably Anker’s $46 PowerCore Magnetic 5K. Apple’s battery pack is smaller — maybe quite a bit smaller — but Anker’s has more storage capacity. With Apple’s, you can plug your iPhone into a wall charger and it will reverse-charge the battery pack, if attached. Anker’s only charges in one direction, from the battery pack to the iPhone, but you can charge the iPhone while the battery pack is connected to a wall charger.
Apple’s battery pack works at 15W — the full speed of MagSafe — but only when the battery pack itself is plugged into a wall charger. When it’s in your pocket, it charges your iPhone at 5W, the same speed at which Anker’s always charges. The other notable difference is that only Apple’s battery pack shows its charge level in the iOS Battery widget.
A bit of a shame that Apple is only selling it in white (for now?) — most of their recent battery cases have been available in both black and white (and sometimes pink and Product Red).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For more than 21 years, Noah Kalina has taken a photograph of himself. Periodically, he makes video compilations of the photos — you’ve probably seen them here or elsewhere. For his latest video, he’s collaborated with Michael Notter (visuals) and Paul O’Mara (sound) on a video called 7777 Days.
In a first step, Michael used the machine learning library dlib (http://dlib.net/) and some custom Python code to detected in each of Noah’s photos 5 face landmarks (i.e. both eyes, the nose and the two corners of the mouth). These landmarks were then used to align the faces in all photos, so that the eyes and corner of the mouth were horizontally oriented and always an equal distance apart. After that, some small image intensity correction were applied to make very dark images a bit brighter and very bright ones a bit darker. This was followed by an upscaling of all images (where needed) to a 4K resolution.


The result is a 2-minute video (reminiscent of Jason Salavon’s work) that spans half of Kalina’s life — in the video he ages 2 months every second and 10 years a minute.

Developers can download the ‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌‌ 11.5 beta using the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper profile from the Apple Developer Center.



‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.5 introduces an update to the Podcasts app that allows the Podcasts Library tab to show all shows or only followed shows. It also addresses an issue that could cause music not to update play count and last played date in the library, and a bug that caused smart cards not to work when logging into Mac computers with the M1 chip.

To install the ‌watchOS 7.6 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the iPhone by going to General > Software Update.



To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



According to Apple's release notes for the update, watchOS 7.6 adds support for the ECG app and irregular heart rhythm notifications in 30 additional regions.

Designed for the latest Apple TV models, the tvOS 14.7 developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There's no word yet on what's included in tvOS 14.7 update, but we'll update this article should anything new be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

Season 4 Reloaded will also finally let players explore Mauer Der Toten
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s mid-season update will include new weapons, new multiplayer maps, and a new spot to survive the undead hordes of Zombies mode. The patch still isn’t due for another day, but on Monday Treyarch gave fans a preview of the new update.
The highlight of the season 4 Reloaded patch is Mauer Der Toten, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s newest round-based Zombies map. The new map is set in a sprawling block of Berlin and will feature everything from rooftops to U-Bahn trains. Mauer Der Toten will also introduce a few new enemies, a new Wonder Weapon with four unique variants, and plenty more secrets and Easter eggs for players to discover.

A classic callback
 Sick of Eivor in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla? You can now turn them into master assassin Altaïr — the original protagonist from Assassin’s Creed. OK, it won’t actually be Altaïr, but you can dress up Eivor to wear the iconic outfit that Altaïr wears.
Ubisoft is giving away the Altaïr costume through its Ubisoft Connect program, which is a free thing that’s supposed to connect players across platforms. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and a few other Ubisoft games, that means progression is saved between console and PC, too. But it also means different skins and weapons for free or with Ubisoft Connect points, called Units. (You can get units by playing Ubisoft games and leveling in Ubisoft Connect. It’s basically a loyalty program.)

The Altaïr outfit was previously available as a community reward in March, but this is a second chance for players to snag the ’fit. To get it, players have to sign up for Ubisoft Connect and redeem their Units on the Rewards page. From there, it’ll be unlocked in the game to be equipped through the inventory menu, Ubisoft said.
It’s no “turn your raven into a pigeon,” but the Altaïr outfit is still quite good.]]></summary>

Look at this asshole
 The 1999 PlayStation game Legend of Mana, recently remastered for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC, is a bit of an acquired taste. It’s an aggressively weird fantasy game that is also half a dozen other games in one, and it’s not particularly great at anything it tries. Yet I have nothing but fondness for this strange little experiment, since it’s incredibly charming throughout. Except when it comes to Niccolo, the bunny salesman. He’s a piece of shit. 
Niccolo is one of the first characters you can meet in Legend of Mana. He’s a salesman with a whole schtick about making all of his customers smile thanks to the value he brings to their lives. There is nothing true about this. He’s a conniving bastard, and he’s also racist…]]></summary>

In 2020, Apple introduced a digital car key feature that allows users to unlock and start a compatible vehicle by holding an iPhone or Apple Watch near the driver-side door. The feature is powered by the NFC-based Digital Key 2.0 specification, and once Apple moves to Digital Key 3.0, users will be able to unlock and start a compatible vehicle without needing to take their iPhone out of their pocket or bag.



The improved Ultra Wideband version of Apple's car key feature would require devices with the U1 chip like iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The airline JetBlue has today announced that it will be equipping its pilots with the M1 iPad Pro.





JetBlue was one of the first airlines in the United States to adopt digital documentation in the cockpit. The airline first received Federal Aviation Administration approval to give iPads to all pilots in 2013, which enabled pilots to use the iPad for operational tracking apps, hosting system maintenance checks, checking real-time weather patterns to avoid turbulence, accessing procedures and manuals, and more. In 2015, JetBlue became the first airline to accept Apple Pay in-flight.



Now, JetBlue will begin rolling out Apple's latest ‌iPad Pro‌ featuring the ‌M1‌ chip to all new pilots and will replace older models that are currently in use over time.
‌iPad Pro‌ is the right fit for the cockpit, with its thin, light design and large, bright Liquid Retina display. The new ‌iPad Pro‌ features the industry-leading ‌M1‌ chip, which offers next-level performance when pilots are running more than a dozen apps throughout the duration of the flight. ‌iPad Pro‌'s fast 5G capabilities delivers better performance and access to next-generation download and upload speeds.
The ‌iPad Pro‌ will provide "safety-critical functions" to crewmembers and will future-proof the company with powerful hardware for years to come.

PS5 and PC horror game now coming in ‘early 2022’
 Ghostwire: Tokyo, the next game from The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks, won’t make its previously scheduled release date. Originally expected in 2021, the game has been delayed to sometime in “early 2022,” the studio announced Tuesday in a statement posted to the game’s official Twitter account.
“We want to get the game in your hands as soon as possible so you can experience the unforgettable version of a haunted Tokyo that we’ve been hard at work building,” the developer said. “At the same time, we’re also focused on protecting the health of everyone at Tango. Our new release window will give us time to bring the world of Ghostwire to life as we’ve always envisioned it.”

The patent, spotted by Patently Apple, is simply titled "Folded camera," and was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.



Periscope camera systems attempt to address the problem of internal size constraints inside a smartphone that can limit image quality. The patent explains: 
The advent of small, mobile multipurpose devices such as smartphones and tablet or pad devices has resulted in a need for high-resolution, small form factor cameras that are lightweight, compact, and capable of capturing high resolution, high quality images at low F-numbers for integration in the devices...

Square Enix confirms what’s changing
 Square Enix’s promised update for the Windows PC version of Nier: Automata is coming this Thursday, according to an update on the game’s Steam page. The Steam-specific patch will include updates to stabilize Nier: Automata’s frame rate, as well as add 4K resolution textures for certain visuals, and additional graphics tweaks.
Nier: Automata’s Steam patch was announced in April, shortly after the game came to Game Pass for PC and players noticed that that version was technically superior to the previously released version available through Valve’s digital storefront.
Nier: Automata launched on Windows PC in March 2017, about two weeks after its PlayStation 4 debut in the West. Reviews of the PC version panned it…]]></summary>

Slow and reverby, the singer’s perhaps-least-favorite Radiohead song takes on new life for this (second?) oddest of years. On first listen, I like but maybe don’t love this version, but some of the YT comments are worth reading:
Can’t believe Thom Yorke finally collaborated with Radiohead. Two of my favorite artists making a song together



Thom has went so far into artistic discovery he looped back on himself. It’s like post-post-irony, but musically



I can’t believe Thom made a doomer wave version of his own fucking song



Thom nailed this one, he sounds just like the originals singer!


You can find the song on a variety of platforms.

*Seems like a fun time to look back on the Vegas draft, and how all of that shook out for the Golden Knights. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*Back to the Krak(en), what if they take Jake Voracek off of our hands? Would be really nice. Would be very cool of them to do that. [BSH]
*Speaking of cool things, the Flyers were able to make a ton of money off of tee shirts, which they donated to cancer research in Oskar Lindblom’s name. [Inquirer]
*It would appear that if there is a high-profile player on the market right now, the Flyers are in the mix, rumors-wise. So, Vladimir Tarasenko. What would it take? [The Athletic]

Underlining its commitment to continue raising the bar for the Chromium-based browser, the company today updated its feature roadmap to reflect what else is coming to Edge down the pipe.





Microsoft's "What's Next" page for Edge comes across as more of a checklist that its internal developers work from, and as such, some newly listed features, like Tab groups (coming this month) and the option to hide the titlebar (September 2021), have been known about for some time. Several previously unknown features have been revealed though, and one enterprising Reddit user has collated the new additions to the page, reproduced below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AT&T today announced new features that will be provided to its Unlimited Elite customers, which is its highest-tier and most expensive data plan at $85 per month.





Starting this week, Unlimited Elite customers will have access to unlimited data that is not slowed down at peak times after hitting a specific data cap. AT&T says that all Unlimited Elite customers can continue to access high-speed data regardless of how much data they've used.



AT&T Unlimited Elite previously included 100GB of premium data, after which AT&T would temporarily slow data speeds at times of peak usage.



AT&T is also increasing mobile hotspot data from 30GB to 40GB, so Unlimited Elite customers can use more data when tethered. HBO Max, which is included in the Unlimited Elite plan, can now be streamed in 4K resolution.



Additionally, AT&T is building in ActiveArmor security, which is designed to automatically block fraud calls and notify users of spam risk alerts.



The Unlimited Elite plan includes unlimited talk and text, 5G access, unlimited texting to more than 120 countries, and six months of Stadia Pro access. These new features will be automatically rolling out to all Unlimited Elite customers this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mike Masnick, writing at Techdirt on the latest antitrust case against Google:
Even the market definition (the key to any antitrust case) is…
weird. Obviously, how you define the market will show whether or
not there’s a monopoly — and if you define the market as “the
products that only this company makes” then of course that’s a
monopoly. But that’s not really relevant for a question of whether
or not there is anti-competitive behavior. But here, these states
have come up with a market definition that is basically just
Android. They’re not even doing the “mobile operating system”
market. Instead, they claim that the relevant market is
specifically “the licensable mobile OS market” — meaning that
Apple iOS (which is not licensable from Apple) is excluded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney today told subscribers that it is raising the price for its ESPN+ standalone streaming service. Starting on August 13, the monthly price will increase from $5.99 to $6.99, and the yearly price will increase from $59.99 per year to $69.99 per year.





Prices for UFC pay-per-view matches will remain unchanged, and the bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will not be increasing. That bundle will continue to be priced at $13.99 per month.



This is the second time that Disney has raised ESPN+ pricing, with the cost going up $1 to $5.99 for new subscribers last year.



Disney recently inked a deal with the National Hockey League for 75 exclusive games, and it also acquired rights to live stream Wimbledon. As of April, ESPN+ had close to 14 million subscribers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[California State University today announced the launch of a new CSUCCESS program that is designed to provide equitable opportunities to students through the use of technology.





The first phase of the initiative will see CSU providing a 64GB iPad Air, Apple Pencil, and Apple Smart Keyboard Folio to all incoming first year and transfer students at eight participating campuses in Fall 2021. Students will need to register to participate, and the CSUCCESS website says that with a keyboard attachment and pencil, the ‌iPad Air‌ is "comparable to a laptop."



CSU Chancellor Joseph I. Castro said that the initiative will "assure that students have immediate access to innovative, new mobile tools they need to support their learning," with the ‌iPad Air‌ serving as a "powerful tool" that will prepare students for their future careers.



Susan Prescott, Apple's Vice President of Education and Enterprise Marketing, said that Apple is "thrilled" about the ‌iPad Air‌ rollout at CSU campuses.
"At Apple, we believe that education is a powerful force for equity and opportunity, and that technology can empower all students to achieve their goals," said Susan Prescott, Apple's Vice President of Education and Enterprise Marketing. "We're thrilled that ‌iPad Air‌ and the incredible education apps in the App Store will be central to the experience at CSU campuses across California, and will play a part in the learning and career development of students from Humboldt to San Marcos."
Students at the CSU campuses located in Bakersfield, Channel Islands, Fresno, Humboldt, Los Angeles, Maritime Academy, Northridge and San Marcos will be participating in the first phase of the program.

Frontier Developments explains why
 Elite Dangerous is currently in turmoil, and developer Frontier Developments is taking steps to get the situation under control. The recent Odyssey update caused issues, leading to frame-rate drops, buggy planet generation, and other issues. Fixing up Odyssey has changed the timeline of Elite Dangerous’s other updates, and fans have been frustrated.
Console players are going to have to wait to get their hands on Odyssey while Frontier Developments fixes up the PC version of the game. The Odyssey update was a massive undertaking, tens of thousands of new places to go and the ability to explore worlds on foot. It was originally meant to arrive on consoles on fall 2021. There is no new release date as of yet.
David Braben, the CEO and founder of Frontier, explained the studio’s decision in a thorough post on the game’s official forums. He wrote,
Ultimately, we believe it is right to focus our efforts on the core Elite Dangerous Odyssey experience for the platforms that we have released on, before opening up to more. We know that the work that we do to improve players’ experiences of Elite Dangerous Odyssey on PC will benefit other platforms in the future, but the dates and details of the console platforms are going to change. We do not want to rush into confirming any dates or changes this has on our console release, as we must remain fully focused on the core Elite experience. Only when we feel that the foundation of the PC release is solid, will we be able to re-lay our console roadmap on top.

The team intends to focus on game updates that fix bugs and improve performance, as well as add additional features to the game. “Behind every bug fix, design decision and community post is a person who cares a lot about giving our players best possible experience,” said Braben.
Elite Dangerous is currently available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new beta version of the HomePod 15 software, and it appears that the update introduces Lossless Audio support for the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini.





Back in June, Apple added higher-quality Lossless Audio and Spatial Audio support to Apple Music, but at launch, Lossless Audio was not available on the ‌HomePod‌ or the ‌HomePod mini‌. Apple in a support document clarified that Lossless Audio would come to the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ in the future, and it appears the higher quality audio will be available this fall when the new ‌HomePod‌ 15 software is available to the public.



According to 9to5Mac, those who have the ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta software can enable Lossless Audio by opening up the Home app, tapping the Home icon in the upper left corner, selecting "Home Settings" and then tapping the user profile.



From there, scroll down to "Media" and select the "Apple Music" tab, toggling on "Lossless Audio." When playing a song that supports Lossless quality, the ‌Apple Music‌ player will feature a Lossless icon to make it clear that you're listening to the Lossless tier.



It is not clear if there are other features in the ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta, but the prior updates have led to complaints about sudden failures and overheating, which may have been caused by the new software.



The ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta is available on an invite-only basis from Apple and it is not widely available to developers or public beta testers.

King James Icon skin arrives on July 14
 LeBron James is the newest Fortnite Icon skin. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar, and soon to be Space Jam 2 leading man, will arrive in the game with his own unique outfits and accessories on Wednesday. 
James’ Fortnite skin includes three specially designed outfits for players to choose from. Among these skins is a Taco Tuesday-themed option, and a Tune Squad option that features James in his uniform from the upcoming movie Space Jam: A New Legacy. The skins also comes with the King’s Back Bling, and can be bought in a bundle that includes the Wingspan Glider, Lion Pickaxe, and the Silencer Emote — one of James’ signature on-court celebrations.  
LeBron James isn’t the only international superstar that Epic Games has collaborated with for a Fortnite skin. The game also has skins from streamers like Ninja, athletes like Neymar Jr., and musicians like Travis Scott and Marshmello, not to mention the variety of fictional characters in the game as well. 
James’ Fortnite skin will be available in the in-game shop starting July 14.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new version of the HomePod 15 beta software that's designed to go along with the iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey betas.





The new software comes as multiple ‌HomePod‌ owners running the original ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta have complained of sudden failures and heat issues that have rendered their HomePods non-functional.



‌HomePod‌ beta software is distributed on an invite-only basis to select users, so there is no update that can be downloaded by developers or the general public.



There are ways to get the ‌HomePod‌ software if you're not a part of Apple's testing group, but because it's designed for a small number of users on an invite-only basis, we do not recommend using any alternate method to obtain the update.



It is beta software and can be unreliable, as the multiple reports of hardware failures demonstrate. These issues have also affected those with the 14.6 release software, but there does not appear to be a new public version of the ‌HomePod‌ software at this time.



The release notes for the ‌HomePod‌ 15 update do not offer any information and do not indicate whether the failure issue has been addressed.

Getting back into League’s lore
 For years, League of Legends lore has been hit or miss, a mass of retcons and origin stories. For a while, I checked out, exhausted with the constant origin stories that never seemed to lead anywhere. Now, between Wild Rift and the current Sentinels of Light story, I’m fully back on the hype train. I haven’t been this pumped about League in years, and it’s largely because of the Avengers-style team-up currently going on in the world of Runeterra.
I’ve been faithfully following along since the early days, when half of the champions were essentially aliens who had been teleported to this fantasy world and then conscripted into gladiator status. The original nations were vaguely defined with themes like “Pirate Town” and “Bad Guys.” …]]></summary>

A scene from Russian film "Loveless" produced by Alexander Rodnyansky


The deal will reportedly provide Apple with an opportunity to secure Russian-language and multilingual shows for Apple TV+, set both inside and outside Russia, with both Russian and international writers and directors.



"Apple is extremely interested to explore the possibilities in that part of the world," said Rodnyansky, who received Academy Award nominations for the 2014 film "Leviathan" and 2017 film "Loveless." "It's going to be the very first of all the global streaming platforms to sign a strategic partnership with a company with Russian roots."



Apple TV+ is gradually expanding its non-English content. Israeli spy thriller series "Tehran" has primarily Hebrew dialogue, and last month, Apple greenlit contemporary thriller "Liaison" as its first French-language series.

UK patent holder Optis Cellular Technology is suing Apple for patent infringement after it refused to pay license fees worth around $7 billion for using "standardized" smartphone technology in its devices.



Last month, a British High Court judge ruled that Apple had infringed two Optis patents relating to technology that enables devices to connect to cellular networks. Optis has also made a number of additional claims about patent infringements from Apple. Kathleen Fox Murphy, a lawyer representing Optis, commented that "everyone thinks about Apple as the market leader in smartphones, but Apple ha…]]></summary>

The LiDAR Scanner is a small sensor that uses 3D sensing to measure the distance to surrounding objects up to five meters away. This technology allows for enhanced augmented reality experiences and other unique capabilities, such as the ability to measure a person's height instantly.



Apple introduced the LiDAR scanner on the iPad Pro in March 2020, and later expanded it to the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. Since then, there have been conflicting rumors about whether Apple will bring the feature to all iPhone 13 models in 2021.

*Next up on the draft board is another kid from Halifax, which rules. [BSH]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple plans to release its sixth-generation iPad mini this fall with a new design that features slimmer bezels, a larger display, and improved performance, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman reports.





In the latest edition of his weekly "Power On" newsletter, Gurman says the new ‌iPad mini‌, which is rumored to include an 8.4-inch display, an increase from the current 7.9-inch screen size, is a "go for this fall." Apple last updated its ‌iPad mini‌ in 2019 with Apple Pencil support, and Gurman calls the upcoming update the ‌iPad mini‌'s "biggest redesign" since it launched.



Last fall, Apple updated its baseline iPad with an improved processor, followed by a major redesign to the iPad Air. The updated ‌iPad Air‌ features no Home Button and an-all screen design. Gurman says the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will feature a design "similar" to the current latest ‌iPad Air‌.



Apple leaker Jon Prosser recently shared renders of what he claims to be the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌. According to the leaker, the ‌iPad mini‌ will feature a Touch ID sensor embedded into the power button, a hardware change first introduced in the ‌iPad Air‌. He also claims it will feature an A14 chip and a USB-C port rather than a Lightning port.



Apple is said to be releasing multiple products this fall, which alongside the annual iPhone and Apple Watch revamp, we're also expecting redesigned MacBook Pros and the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro will feature an upgraded 1080p webcam, compared to the current 720p "FaceTime HD" camera in Apple's latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, according to a leaker who goes by the name "Dylandkt."





In a tweet, the leaker says that the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros will be receiving "an updated, improved 1080p webcam" alongside the "entire Mac lineup." Apple's most recent Mac, the 24-inch iMac, features a 1080p webcam; however, its ‌MacBook Air‌ and MacBook Pro continue to feature a 720p camera. While the quality of the webcam itself hasn't changed, Apple says that thanks to M1 and its latest image signal processor, image quality is improved on the MacBooks. 



It's worth noting that "Dylandkt" has provided accurate information in the past. In November, five months before Apple announced its new iPad Pro, the account stated that Apple would bring the M1 chip to its next-generation iPad, which turned out to be accurate. 



A few days before Apple's "Spring Loaded" event, which included the release of the redesigned 24-inch ‌iMac‌, the account posted that the new Mac would feature an ‌M1‌ chip, rather than an upgraded "M1X" iteration.



More recently, the account claimed that the "M2" chip will debut in updated and colorful MacBook Airs next year. The account added that the "M1X" chip is being reserved for high-end "Pro" Macs. Apple is expected to announce its redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with an upgraded Apple silicon processor, a new design, and more this fall.

 Stardew Valley is the game that just keeps on giving. Since its release in 2016, it has seen more than its fair share of generous updates. However, there’s still little things you could improve here and there. Thanks to a mod from Shekurika, one part of the game just got a little easier to play: fishing.

Usually in Stardew Valley, you cast your line onto the the blank slate of the open water. Unlike similar games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you don't see shadows of fish or even a disturbance on the surface of the water. Oftentimes, you’ll have to cast your lure in a few spots before you get a bite. This mod changes the game so you’ll be able see all the fish’s sprites spawn in the water. That way, you know exactly where to place your lure if you’re looking for a specific fish to flesh out your collection or complete a recipe. 
It’s a thoughtful adjustment because fishing in Stardew can be a little bit tricky. The rod is slightly finicky, and you’ll lose fish after hooking them if you aren’t careful. It’s probably one of the hardest skills to learn in the game. This mod cuts down on the grind and helps you to catch what you need, even if you aren’t the most skilled angler. 
The mod also adds a few bonus configuration options. If you want, you can tweak how many fish spawn on the map to create more fish. Also, you can toggle an option to allow the player to see the game’s other “fishable” items — like a rusty spoon and spur — as well. 
The mod is currently published on Nexus Mods — and due to a recent policy change on the website, this and all its other mods will be permanently stored online. So if this seems like a feature you’d like, well you have all the time in the world to grab it.]]></summary>

The expansion draft is less than two weeks away.
 It’s the beginning of hell. Several grueling weeks of rumors and whispers and transactions, and it’s all starting to ramp up with the Philadelphia Flyers either involved in a lot of trade ideas or just yelling about how poor the season just was. It certainly doesn’t help those who want a calm offseason (those freaks) that the Seattle Kraken’s expansion draft is the very first hurdle 30 teams need to throw themselves over and see if they aren’t severely dismembered on the other side.
Protection lists are due in just a week and the Flyers still have some decisions to make, but according to Elliotte Friedman, there is at least one thing made clear.

The spot focuses on night mode selfies, showing a man taking photos of himself in various low lighting situations. "Now you can take amazing selfies in the dark," reads the tagline of video, which also uses the song "In The Dark" by YG.



Night mode was first introduced with the iPhone 11, but it was previously limited to the rear-facing camera. With the launch of the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup, Apple expanded Night mode to the front-facing camera and added a feature for taking Portrait mode shots in the dark.

 Many early EV ventures used existing platforms and arranged electric powertrains to fit where gas engines and transmissions had previously resided. Even Tesla’s first attempt was a revamped Lotus Elise without its 1.8-liter inline-four. Working on a nondedicated, or “nonnative,” electric platform limited designers’ options for positioning the battery and motor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vice has a sometimes less-than-flattering profile of Best Electronics’ Bradley Koda, a persnickety entrepreneur who has an unrivaled catalog of old-school Atari console parts and a reputation for shutting out buyers who get impatient with doing things his way:
Among Atari fans, Best is almost as famous for ignoring and blacklisting badly behaved customers as it is for selling Atari parts. A first attempt to buy from Best Electronics is a sink-or-swim proposition: learn the rules, or accept your fate…
Koda is a monopolist, of a sort, but he’s no Jeff Bezos. Best Electronics has no virtual shopping cart, or any other Amazon-esque conveniences. The store’s website looks the same as it has since the early 2000s: it’s a lengthy, multicoloured text scroll, as if Jack Kerouac quit the novel-writing business (but not the benzedrine) and started typing about Atari… 
 

Anyone who can’t figure out this system risks being deemed a time-waster. In emails to customers, Koda often laments his busy schedule, and he seems to take distractions personally. He would rather lose a sale than suffer someone who hasn’t learned the rules.
 

Best has been in business more than 25 years. Its equipment is mostly unused Atari originals, not salvaged parts. The company’s catalog was printed more than 20 years ago (and is available only in print); corrections (including changes in price) are only available online. His customers both love him and fear him. 
In short, it’s a throwback to old-school nerd retail, the kind lampooned by The Simpsons’ Comic Book Guy. What, did you think finding first-rate replacement parts for your forty-year old video game machine would be like buying AA batteries?

Visceral Games’ horror game manages the perfect balance of stress and spectacle
 Dead Space 2 was released ten years ago. In the time since, we’ve seen the size and ambition of in-game setpieces balloon. Games like God of War place huge importance on their cinematic camera techniques. The recently released Resident Evil 8 has some of the most technically complex scenes ever put in a horror game. 
And yet. Even a decade removed from Dead Space 2, I still think it pulls off tense action sequences better than most modern games. Through a combination of clearly communicated motivations, well-considered pacing, and staggering aesthetic design, Dead Space 2’s setpieces continue to stand tall with the best of the medium.

Television has become a haven for cutting edge horror content and there are greater risks being taken with programs that gleefully deconstruct the genre or combine it together […]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tom’s Guide:
After creating the A Series for the iPhone and scaling it up for
the iPad, Apple’s team of engineers set its sights on the Mac, but
the M1 chip couldn’t just match what Intel had to offer. It had to
handily beat it.
“If somebody else could build a chip that was actually going to
deliver better performance inside that enclosure, what’s the
point? Why would we switch?” said Tim Milet, vice president of
platform architecture at Apple. “And so for my chip architects,
that was the target.” […]
The most striking thing about the M1 is its battery life. For
example, the MacBook Pro lasted an astounding 16 hours and 25
minutes in our web-surfing test. The previous Intel model lasted
10:21. That’s a huge difference, and this increase caused more
than one double take within Apple.
“When we saw that first system and then you sat there and played
with it for a few hours and the battery didn’t move, we thought
‘Oh man, that’s a bug, the battery indicator is broken,’” said Bob
Borchers, VP of worldwide product marketing for Apple. “And then
Tim’s laughing in the background, ‘Nope, that’s the way it’s
supposed to be’ and it was pretty phenomenal.”

The game’s ultimate form got announced at WitcherCon
 Geralt of Rivia’s third video game adventure will get some new gear inspired by Netflix's The Witcher series.
At the first WitcherCon, streamed remotely via YouTube, CD Projekt Red reminded fans that it’s working on a next-gen update for The Witcher 3, which comes with the Complete Edition subtitle. The upgrade is set for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC. Fans who already own The Witcher 3 will get the Complete Edition upgrade for free.
The Complete Edition also comes with “free DLC” to make the game’s Geralt a bit more reminiscent of actor Henry Cavill. A developer from CD Projekt Red suggested that fans could pick up new armor modeled after Cavill’s Netflix series getup. But Netflix-inspired armor won’t be the only additions to the game taken from the show, and the studio promised to reveal more details at a later date.
CD Projekt Red did not reveal a timeline for The Witcher 3: Complete Edition upgrade. The studio’s other game, Cyberpunk 2077, is also set for a next-gen upgrade later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benjamin Mayo, reporting for 9to5Mac:
Apple TV+ today announced a new documentary special airing later
this year. The show is entitled 9/11: Inside the President’s War
Room and will explore the 2001 terrorist attack from the
perspective of the immediate response of the people in charge. The
special will be narrated by Jeff Daniels and include testimony
from ex-President George Bush, Dick Cheney, and more. In a notable
move for the streaming service, the special will premiere
simultaneously on Apple TV+ and on the publicly-funded broadcast
channel BBC One.
As you might expect, the special will air in September in
commemoration of the 20th anniversary of 9/11. In the UK, the
special will first be broadcast on BBC One and appear on Apple TV+
later. In all other regions, it will debut on Apple TV+
exclusively.
They’ve moved beyond Carpool Karaoke, that’s for sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sahil Patel, reporting for The Information:
The iPhone maker is one of a number of companies, including TV
networks and other tech firms, that have had discussions with NFL
executives lately about the package of games, including at this
week’s Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley for tech and media
executives. The rights cover a package known as Sunday Ticket,
which now airs on DirecTV. They are separate from a slew of
licensing deals recently completed between the NFL, most major
broadcast TV networks and Amazon. ESPN’s parent Disney is among
those likely to be interested in Sunday Ticket.
Sunday Ticket is no small thing. It’s not like the deal Amazon has had for a few years where they have the streaming rights for a small handful of Thursday night games. Sunday Ticket packages include all games — it’s a super premium tier for big fans and sports bars that want to show every game.
I feel like TV+ is following an interesting trajectory: slowly and steadily building into a unique premium TV service. Some sort of major foray into live sports seems like a good next step.

Pick up two weapons and two armor pieces
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Javelin-4
3 wins —  Pyrrhic Ascent Vest, Plate, Vestment (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock chest)
5 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock class item)
Flawless — Shayura’s Wrath (Adept), Void submachine gun — random Adept mod
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

(One fun fact: Zaila’s last name is an homage by her father to John Coltrane.)
 Zaila, who just finished eighth grade in her hometown, Harvey, La., showed a prowess for spelling at 10, when her father, who had been watching finals of the Scripps National Spelling Bee on ESPN, asked her how to spell the winning word: marocain.
Zaila spelled it perfectly. Then he asked her to spell the winning words going back to 1999. She spelled nearly all of them correctly and was able to tell him the books where she had seen them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's stock closed at an all-time high price of $144.57 on Wednesday and continues to extend its gains this week, reaching a new intraday high above $145 in trading today. Apple shares have risen around 17% since the start of June.





The stock market gains come ahead of Apple's third quarter earnings results, which will be reported on July 27. Apple unveiled several new products during the quarter, including the AirTag and new models of the iPad Pro, iMac, and Apple TV in April, and previewed major new software updates like iOS 15 and macOS Monterey at WWDC in June.



Apple's market cap is approaching a staggering $2.5 trillion, making it the world's most valuable tech company. Microsoft joined Apple in the $2 trillion valuation club for the first time last month, with gains extending to several major tech stocks.



According to Yahoo Finance, analysts on average expect Apple to set a new third quarter revenue record of $72.9 billion, up around 22% from $59.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple's CFO Luca Maestri cautioned that supply constraints could have a revenue impact of $3 billion to $4 billion in the third quarter, with industry-wide chip shortages affecting supply of iPads and Macs, which could impact the results.

The Nanoleaf Elements feature a textured wood-like material that can be lit up with cool or warm white light, and when off, they appear to be simple wood panels, offering a more natural look than the white plastic of prior versions.





The Nanoleaf Elements panels are not real wood and are still made from a plastic material, but there is a wood-like veneer. When not lit up, the Nanoleaf Elements look reasonably enough like wood from a distance, and it's definitely a different aesthetic than the plain plastic of other Nanoleaf light panels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest beta for iOS and iPadOS 14.7, released to developers this week, patches a bug that disabled an iPhone's ability to connect to Wi-Fi if a user connected to a specific Wi-Fi network with the name "%p%s%s%s%s%n."





In his latest video rounding up the latest changes in the beta, YouTuber Zollotech found that the update has silently patched the bug that caused an iPhone to become unable to connect to Wi-Fi networks. 



The bug was discovered on Twitter last month and consisted of an ‌iPhone‌ connecting to a Wi-Fi SSID with the name "%p%s%s%s%s%n." According to user reports, doing so would "permanently disable" an ‌iPhone‌'s Wi-Fi functionality, making the bug rather dangerous. 



While some have claimed the bug "permanently" disabled their ‌iPhone‌'s Wi-Fi, other users found that resetting their network settings after connecting to the network restored Wi-Fi for the ‌iPhone‌. 



Apple has been testing iOS and iPadOS 14.7 with developers and public beta testers for the past few weeks. Apple can be expected to publicly release the update soon, given the crucial bug fix that it provides to ‌iPhone‌ user.



Last month, Apple previewed iOS 15, the next major update to iOS destined for a public launch this fall. The upcoming update to iOS 14 will likely be the last major update to the operating system ahead of ‌iOS 15‌'s fall release.

Back to Halifax. 
 If you’ve been watching the Flyers’ prospects playing in the CHL closely, this may be a name that sounds familiar. L’Heureux spent this season with Halifax of the QMJHL, where he was teammates with the Flyers’ own Eliot Desnoyers. And while Desnoyers was putting up his own torrid scoring pace, L’Heureux was right behind him, coming in second on the team in scoring (and tied for eighth in goals scored in the whole of the QMJHL). There was a lot to like about his season, his own impacts on that team turning a lot of heads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is interested in streaming rights for the National Football League's "Sunday Ticket" package, reports The Information. Apple has had discussions with NFL executives, but the NFL is also speaking with TV networks and other tech firms as well.





Sunday Ticket streaming content currently airs on DirecTV, but it is up for auction and should Apple acquire the rights, out-of-market fans will be able to watch non-prime time games from all 32 NFL teams on Apple TV+.



DirecTV pays somewhere around $1.5 billion to broadcast the Sunday Ticket games, but its deal with the NFL expires in 2022, paving the way for other networks to bid on the package. The NFL is looking to get more money when establishing a new deal.



ESPN parent company Disney is said to be interested in acquiring the rights for the ESPN streaming service, and according to The Information, Apple is not seen as a serious contender for the rights because it has been reluctant to invest money in entertainment programming.



That said, Apple has an ongoing relationship with the National Football League, and in 2020, hired James DeLorenzo to run a sports division for ‌Apple TV+‌. DeLorenzo previously negotiated Amazon's deal with the NFL to stream live games.



Apple previously held talks with the Pac-12 conference about live streaming college sports, but nothing ever came of those talks and there continues to be little sports-related content on ‌Apple TV+‌.



Acquiring the rights to the NFL's Sunday Ticket package would draw a wider audience to ‌Apple TV+‌, appealing to those who live away from their favorite football teams.

Who is the real monster here?
 I love Monster Hunter, but I try not to think about it too hard. 
Monster Hunter is a series that asks me to kill big beasts with sharp fangs and occasionally cuddly tummies. More often than not, they’re existing peacefully in their own ecosystem before I waltz in with my giant horn of doom to turn them into hats, pants, and an entire ensemble for my cat. I cannot pluck a single feather and save the monster. It’s a kill-or-be-killed series, and I’ve collected a lot of pelts over the years. 
With Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, a follow-up to the 2016 turn-based RPG, I was looking forward to a more symbiotic relationship with the monsters. As a Rider, I get to work alongside a companion monster that I raise from bir…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In July 2020, Apple introduced a new all-in-one gift card in the United States that combines its previously separate Apple Store and iTunes gift cards into one, and the combined gift card is now available in Canada and Australia as well.





The new Apple Gift Card can be applied towards "everything Apple," including purchases of Apple products and accessories, App Store apps, iTunes Store content like TV shows and movies, services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade, iCloud+ plans, and more. The gift card is available on Apple's website in digital and physical versions, with the physical card sent by mail including a collectible Apple logo sticker available in five designs.



The gift card's availability in Canada was alerted to us by MacRumors reader Basic Apple Guy, while 9to5Mac noticed Australia was added too. Apple is no longer selling separate Apple Store and iTunes gift cards in these countries following the transition.



Apple Store and iTunes gift cards remain available in many other countries for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the next several weeks, Apple is offering customers in a select number of U.S. states the opportunity to purchase a wide range of its products without a sales tax.





Every year, select states offer businesses and consumers the incentive of having no sales tax as a way to help boost sales and are usually aimed at helping families lower the cost of back to school shopping. The dates for each state differ, and the selection of states this year is relatively small. Only purchases made during a state's specific holiday are free of state sales tax.



The policy around each state also varies. Alabama, for example, which is holding its sales-free tax holiday between July 16 and 18, requires that the total sales price of all items must remain under $750. Apple products, including Macs, iPad, and the iPod touch, are eligible, alongside accessories such as keyboard, mice, the Apple Pencil, and more. 



Missouri, which is running its holiday between August 6 and 8, has a higher limit of $1500 and the addition of more accessories, including printers, routers, RAM upgrades, the Apple TV, and more. South Carolina, sharing a holiday with Missouri, has no limit and includes tax-free purchases of earbuds, headphones, and flash drives, however only for students. Virginia consists of a limit of only $60 for cell phone chargers and batteries.



More information on Apple's sales tax holiday, participating states and products, can be found on Apple's website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Superbrothers/Pine Scented
    

  
It’s a muted take on an exploration game 
 The co-creator of Sword & Sworcery, Superbrothers, released new details on their sci-fi game, Jett: The Far Shore for Sony’s State of Play on Thursday. Superbrothers is creating the game in partnership with Pine Scented. A PlayStation blog on the game has an extended trailer as well as plenty of new gameplay details. 
The game looks like a more introspective take on sci-fi exploration. You play as Mei, a researcher who is part of a group of aviator scientists who embark on an interstellar trip and arrive on an ocean planet. “We aspired to create a video game to express our own feelings of awe when we look up at the starry sky,” the trailer says. 
The new look showed a deeper dive into gameplay. In Jett, you’ll be flying a lot; you’ll pilot your spaceship in third person and weave your way through trees and obstacles. As you explore, you’ll be able to leave your ship and explore the land on foot as well, in first-person view. 
The trailer explains that the game doesn’t rely on combat or resource extraction. You’ll have the opportunity to respect the indigenous wildlife of the planet. Overall, it looks like like a much more peaceful, less violent take on an exploration game — which is a genre that has historically pushed players to harvest as much as possible from the land. 
Jett: The Far Shore was originally announced in June 2020. Since then, the studio has said that the game would be delayed to 2021. It is still slated to release in 2021 for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and on PC via the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-09T13:56:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new ad called "Haystack" in which a rancher uses his Apple Watch to find his iPhone 12 in a haystack. The ad plays on the "needle in a haystack" idiom and is set to the song "Searching (For Someone Like You)" by country singer Kitty Wells.






In the one-minute ad, a rancher drives down a rural street surrounded by bales of hay. He then backs up his truck off the street, walks with his dog to a large haystack, and taps on a button in the Apple Watch's Control Center to ping his iPhone, which results in the iPhone playing a sound to help pinpoint its location if misplaced nearby.



"An iPhone that's lost is easily found," says Apple. "Relax, it's iPhone + Apple Watch." 



To use this feature on the Apple Watch, swipe up to open Control Center and tap the Ping iPhone button, which will make the device chime. You can also touch and hold the Ping iPhone button to make the iPhone flash as well.



Of course, if your iPhone isn't in range of your Apple Watch, you can track its location using the Find My app on another Apple device or iCloud.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toronto-based game developer Snowman today announced that "Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City" will be launching on Apple Arcade on Friday, July 16, as one of several new classic games being added to the subscription-based service.





First released in 2018, Alto's Odyssey is an award-winning endless sandboarding game with beautiful procedurally generated graphics, dynamic lighting and weather conditions, and original music. In the Apple Arcade edition of the game, players will embark on a sandboarding journey to find a new biome called The Lost City and unearth the secrets hidden within, with the classic Alto's Odyssey experience preserved.



At the heart of Alto's Odyssey and its 2015 predecessor, Alto's Adventure, is physics-based movement with a one-touch trick system.






A long list of classic games were added to Apple Arcade in April, including "Fruit Ninja" and "Monument Valley," and more classics are coming soon, including "Angry Birds Reloaded" and "Doodle God Universe." Priced at $4.99 per month, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of nearly 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

How to train your Monstie
 In Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, you’ll join forces with monsters to defeat other monsters. The companions you take on are called Monsties, and they are as valuable to your success as the armor and weapons you forge.
Having the best gear in the game doesn’t matter if you aren’t sure what to choose. To figure out which weapons are the right ones to use for each occasion, check out our weapons guide. Once you’re well-equipped, head over to our combat guide. Fighting with the best gear isn’t all you’ll need to survive. Read our guide on how to combine items to make sure you always have the right healing items on hand.
Adding more Monsties to your party requires you to find the best eggs scattered across the game world. You’ll find them in caves and Everdens as you explore. If you want to pay for the best gear and be stronger than your enemies, you’ll need to learn how to farm for zenny and level up fast.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-09T11:19:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has taken possession of the domain name Mobeewave.com, according to a WHOIS record discovered by MacRumors. The domain name was previously owned by payments startup Mobeewave, which Apple acquired last year.





Mobeewave created a system that lets shoppers tap a credit card or smartphone on another phone to process a payment. The technology works with NFC, which is built into all modern iPhones. 



Apple typically buys startups to turn their technology into features of its products, and the functionality could in future allow iPhones to be used as payment terminals with no additional hardware required. Apple hired the whole Mobeewave team, which includes dozens of employees, and the company is continuing to work from Montreal where it is based.



Prior to the acquisition, Mobeewave demonstrated the simplicity of its technology by showing users inputting a transaction amount into an app and tapping an NFC-enabled card on the back of a smartphone.





Full contact information on the domain transfer is redacted for privacy, but the record's domain information lists Apple's nameservers. The domain is no longer active, although at some point in the future Apple may choose to redirect it to either a related product page or support pages for an upcoming product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is still on track to begin mass production of the upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with mini-LED displays in the third quarter of this year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a note obtained by MacRumors. 





Several reports have pinned the third quarter of the year as a timeframe for when Apple could release the new MacBook Pros. DigiTimes had previously pinned the late portion of the quarter as a launch timeframe, likely referencing a September launch alongside the new iPhones.



Although, while mass production may begin in the third quarter, according to Kuo, which runs from July to September, Apple may decide to hold a separate event for the Mac in October or November, rather than tying the new MacBook Pros with the release of new iPhone and Apple Watch models. 



Additionally, due to continued shortages and struggles with the production of mini-LED displays, Apple may announce the new MacBook Pros but not yet begin shipments until weeks later, similar to what it did for the mini-LED iPad Pro in April. Kuo has previously reported that the new MacBook Pros will feature additional ports, including HDMI and an SD-card slot, the removal of the Touch Bar, and an overall updated design with flat-edges and MagSafe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than a mini-LED display being limited to just the high-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple plans to make the new display technology also available on the smaller 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ next year, according to well respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.





In an investor note obtained by MacRumors today, Kuo said that alongside a new MacBook Air equipped with a mini-LED display next year, Apple is also planning to bring the display technology to both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌. Apple first debuted a mini-LED display this past April in the high-end 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, but the updated 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ did not receive the new display technology. 



Despite both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros being just recently updated, we already know some information about what Apple has planned for next year. Bloomberg has reported that Apple is testing using a glass back rather than an aluminum enclosure for the next release of the ‌iPad Pro‌, which could enable wireless charging for the ‌iPad‌. Additionally, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also reports that Apple is exploring the possibility of iPads with displays larger than 12.9-inches, but those shouldn't be expected anytime soon.

The game’s new trailer shows off action-platforming and impressive graphics
 FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch is a 2D Metroidvania-style platformer where animals take on machines that have invaded their world. FIST got a new trailer during Sony’s State of Play PlayStation stream on Thursday, along with a new release date of Sept. 7.
The game stars Rayton, a rabbit who has been hiding for the last six years since the machines took over his city. When his friend is kidnapped, Rayton has to come out of hiding and face the machines. Like most games in this genre, FIST will feature a huge 2D environment for players to explore, complete with a variety of secrets and upgrades to find. The game features an arcade-style combat system that will allow Rayton to take enemies out with a variety of weapons that he can use for powerful combos.
FIST was first announced back in July 2020 as a PlayStation 4 game. A few months later at The Game Awards 2020, it was revealed that the game would come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and would be out in Spring 2021. Unfortunately, the game didn’t make it in time for spring, but now seems set for a fall release. 
FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch is developed by Bilibili and published by TiGames. The game will be released on Sept. 7 on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.]]></summary>

You’ll have to wait a bit longer
 Absolver developer Sloclap announced that its kung fu brawler, Sifu, is delayed to early 2022.
The announcement came at the end of a new teaser trailer presented during PlayStation’s State of Play event on Thursday. The game was originally slated to come out in 2021. 
In the game, you are tasked with uncovering an “ancient mystery via a series of difficult confrontations that will test your skills to their limit.” To overcome the odds, the protagonist uses a magical pendant that revives them after death. There’s just one twist — each time your character uses the pendant, they age. 
The new trailer showed the smooth combat that the studio is known for in action. Sloclap billed the game as “an artful and true-to-combat Kung Fu game exploring themes of revenge and redemption” when the studio first announced it. 
Throughout the trailer, the main character battles against various opponents, taking roundhouse kicks to the head and dishing out blows in return. Periodically, the trailer includes title cards that show the character’s age ticking upward. As they age, their character design changes; they become noticeably older, and their hair turns gray. 
Sifu will come to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC (via the Epic Games Store).]]></summary>

Demon Slayer arrives in October
 Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — The Hinokami Chronicles, an adaptation of the enormously popular anime, got a spotlight trailer during Thursday’s PlayStation State of Play event. The game features voice work from the series’ original English and Japanese-language actors.
Thursday’s trailer also showed more of the game in action. The Hinokami Chronicles will adapt the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc and Mugen Train Arc from Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Today’s trailer featured Tsuzumi Mansion, giving fans a look at both gameplay and story.
Demon Slayer is being developed by CyberConnect 2, best known for their work on Dragon Ball and Naruto titles. The story is a tale of love, loss, becoming a legendary demon blade, and then trying to save your sister from being a demon. In other words: a concept which should work well for a 3D fighting game.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — The Hinokami Chronicles will arrive Oct. 15. The game will be released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

Check out the new trailer for Sony’s last Bethesda exclusive 
 Arkane Studios and Bethesda Softworks showed off a nine-minute gameplay trailer for Deathloop at Sony’s State of Play on July 8. The trailer offered a new look at the studio’s stylish assassination game.
Deathloop takes place in a time-loop on a mysterious island called Blackreef. Players will take control of Colt, an assassin out to kill eight targets before a single day is through. The point of Deathloop is to fail, gain knowledge of your target’s whereabouts and behaviors, and start again on a new day with a new time-loop. Deathloop’s game director, Dinga Bakaba described it as a “murder puzzle.”
Throughout the nine-minute gameplay trailer shown Thursday, Arkane Studios showed what this sort of gameplay looks like. It focuses largely on a single level featuring a flashy murder club. You can check it out in the trailer above.
To aid him on his quest, Colt has access to some intense powers, including the ability to teleport, throw things with his mind, and wind back time. He’s also being tracked by another assassin named Julianna — who can be controlled by another, invading player or traditional AI.
Deathloop may look similar to the studio’s other titles — namely Dishonored and Prey — but it has its own 1960s spy-thriller visual style and a new structure. Arkane and Bethesda will launch Deathloop for PlayStation 5 and Windows PC on Sept. 14.]]></summary>

But! A brandy alexander is a dang nice drink, and everyone should know how to make one. Even the internet turns up some pretty bizarre recipes that morph into that white Russian I had back in 2016.

He’s got six of ’em
 You can now play Marvel’s Avengers as a shirtless, buff Captain America. The most recent patch for the game adds some Black Widow-related goodies, just in time for her feature film debut, and a new Volcanic skin line. There’s one guy who doesn’t quite fit in, though. Steve Rogers is just rockin’ a beach bod and shades.
Usually skins are meant to look super fancy or provide some alternative dress up, but this one is quite the opposite. He’s got a pair of pants, some aviators, and boots. It’s a fun skin, but definitely not as fan service-y as it could have gone — there are certainly fans who would like to see Captain America trade in the pants for some tiny shorts.

To install the ‌watchOS 7.6 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the iPhone by going to General > Software Update.



To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



We don't yet know what's included in the watchOS 7.6 update, and no new features were discovered in the first four betas, so it's likely the software focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood performance improvements.

Designed for the latest Apple TV models, the tvOS 14.7 developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There's no word yet on what's included in tvOS 14.7 update, but we'll update this article should anything new be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

Until the New Labour movement overhauled the British welfare system in the late 1990s, aspiring musicians were often able to exploit loopholes in the welfare system to support their own work.

The star of this event is Akshan, the Rogue Sentinel. Not only is he League of Legends’ newest champion, he’s also coming to League of Legends: Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, and Teamfight Tactics over the course of the event.

A cottagecore paradise
 Each Saturday, the townspeople of Henford-on-Bagley descend upon the village square for the weekly fair. There are booths for fresh flowers and local vegetables, with picnickers huddled around woven baskets from which they pluck jars of canned fruit. Mushrooms grow wild in the nearby brambles, as mischievous rabbits and foxes play in the mossy groves nearby. Henford-on-Bagley is a self-sufficient community and an idyllic, pastoral paradise — one that feels like it’s been plucked from the coziest of fairy tales.
The Sims 4’s newest expansion pack, Cottage Living, fully embraces the fairytale, cottagecore aesthetic that’s become increasingly popular over the past year. In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, cottagecore was a way…]]></summary>

It’s called reversion, and it doesn’t happen often, because it’s not automatic; there are legal hurdles to jump through to file copyright termination notices, meaning you need money, help, and strong motivation to make it happen.

Sonic Colors Ultimate makes a great Sonic game better
 Sonic Colors stands out as one of the better Sonic the Hedgehog games of the past 30 years, and a new remaster, Sonic Colors Ultimate, promises to make a good game even better. A new trailer from Sega released Thursday shows off what Sonic fans can expect, in terms of new visuals, quality of life improvements, and brand-new features coming in Ultimate.
Of course, there’s the obvious 4K resolution and 60 frames per second visual upgrade to the original 2010 game. There’s also a new Rival Rush mode, wherein Sonic the Hedgehog will race through levels against Metal Sonic for unlockable rewards. Sonic Colors Ultimate will include a bit of visual customization, letting players spend in-game tokens on new shoe and glove patterns for Sonic, finally letting us realize the dream of Sonic the Hedgehog wearing yellow shoes.
There’s also a new Wisp power: Jade Ghost. With it, Sonic can fly around levels and pass through solid objects to access hidden areas. It’s Sonic the Hedgehog in no-clip god mode.
On the quality-of-life front, Sega and Sonic Colors Ultimate developer Blind Squirrel Entertainment will let players customize their control layouts and quickly get back into the action with new Tails Save spots. There’s more in the trailer above.
Sonic Colors Ultimate will launch Sept. 7 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One consoles, with a digital-only release on Windows PC coming to the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

Welcome to Mauer Der Toten
 The first trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s latest Zombies map sends players back to Berlin, Germany to fight undead hordes. The new map is called Mauer Der Toten, and it will be a free update for Black Ops Cold War when it’s released next week.
Mauer Der Toten is set in an area of Berlin totally overrun by Zombies. But it seems that the map will be big enough to give players plenty of space to maneuver. There are plenty of buildings with rooftops to traverse, as well as a subway with deadly highspeed trains. It also seems like the new map will have secret areas to explore and traps to activate. There might also be an automated robot that players can activate to take some pressure off, if the zombies get a little too overwhelming.
In the trailer, the developer also shows off a weapon that fires several mini-rockets at a time, and a space-age pistol that seems to mow down zombies in a flash. As for enemies, there’s a skull-faced zombie that looks like it’s harnessing the power of the Dark Aether to empower other zombies around it.
Mauer Der Toten will be released on July 15 as part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s midseason update, which should include more changes and additions on top of the new Zombies map.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple made further advancements in on-device machine learning and integrated them into the Photos app to make your iPhone more intelligent at recognizing the contents of pictures.





In other words, the ‌Photos‌ app can now identify various objects, landmarks, animals, books, plants, works of art, and more in your image library, and then offer information about them that it draws from the web.



This new intelligent feature is called Visual Lookup, and the following steps show you how you can use it to get more clued up on the things you've taken pictures of with your ‌iPhone‌ through the years.




Open the Photos app on your ‌iPhone‌ and select a picture with a clearly defined subject, such as a flower or animal.


Check the info ("i") icon at the bottom of the screen. If it has a little star over it, tap it – this indicates there's a Visual Lookup you can examine. 


Tap the little icon in the center of the photo to bring up the Lookup search results.


In Visual Lookup, search results consist of Siri Knowledge, similar images found on the web, and other online sources of information. For all the details on the other new ‌Photos‌ features in ‌iOS 15‌, be sure to check our dedicated roundup.

Battle in Apex’s newest Arena map, Overflow
 Apex Legends will piggyback its retro Genesis event with another content update, Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts announced on Thursday morning. Apex’s newest event, Thrillseekers, adds a new Arena map filled with lava, a weekly reward track, and a host of new cosmetics. Thrillseekers will run July 13 to Aug. 3.
Overflow, the new arena map, is the star of the Thrillseekers event and its trailer above. The setting is a large lava factory, where several ramps pump lava into a large pit (also filled with lava). Overflow has some narrow corridors and a long slope separating its upper and lower deck.
For each of Thrillseekers’ three weeks, players can engage in a new reward track. Players who reach the end of the first week can pick up the Rampart Wastelander Set and some other goodies. The second week just offers Battle Pass boosters, metals, and Apex packs.
But the final week includes the Lethal Enforcer Bangalore skin and a boxing glove charm. Players can unlock these rewards by completing daily Challenges — netting up to 1,000 points a day. Participants will need to earn 3,000 points per week to complete the reward tracks.
Of course, Thrillseekers also comes with a host of cosmetics for players to get their hands on, like boxing skins for Revenant and Pathfinder. There are also some in-store deals on returning skins in the Summer Splash Sale.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-08T14:36:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple TV+ today released the trailer for "Mr. Corman," a new comedy series created by, directed by, and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The first two episodes of the 10-episode first season will debut on August 6, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday.






"Mr. Corman" follows the days and nights of Josh Corman (played by Gordon-Levitt), an artist at heart but not by trade. A career in music hasn't panned out, and he teaches fifth grade at a public school in the San Fernando Valley. His ex-fiancé Megan has moved out, and his high school buddy Victor has moved in. He knows he has a lot to be thankful for, but finds himself struggling with anxiety, loneliness, and self-confidence issues.



"Darkly funny, oddly beautiful and deeply heartfelt, this relatable dramedy speaks for our contemporary generation of 30-somethings: rich with good intentions, poor with student loans, and yearning to become real grown-ups sometime before they die," said Apple, in a press release accompanying the trailer.



"Mr. Corman" is distributed by A24, known for films such as "Midsommar" and "Lady Bird."

Small goal boy 2.0.
 It was a short draft year for Logan Stankoven, as he got in just seven games in an extremely shortened WHL season with Kamloops. That doesn’t give us a whole lot to work with, but as always, we’re doing our best out here. Anyway.
There’s a lot to like about Stankoven’s skillset, on the whole. A quick forward who can score in droves, he’s impressed at both the Junior and international levels, and despite some concerns about his size, Stankoven has just continued to be an effective scorer, and making a name for himself as a sneaky exciting prospect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The stream of the Euro 2020 soccer semi-final, one of the UK's most-watched TV moments in recent times, was yesterday hindered by frustrating technical issues for Apple TV users.





The technical problems, first reported on by iMore, affected viewers using the ITV Hub app for the ‌Apple TV‌. According to ITV, the match was watched by as many as 27.6 million people, making it one of the most-watched moments in the UK since the London 2012 Olympics.



Portions of the tense second half of the match between England and Denmark were unwatchable on the ‌Apple TV‌ due to a problem that repeatedly kicked viewers out of the stream. Upon attempting to reconnect, the app played a number of ads before resuming and being kicked out again.




So, the adverts play OK, but then #itvhub decides that it doesn't want to go. Then try again and same result... Good job there's nothing important on tonight, like say a sporting event.. pic.twitter.com/RNZilb3Urc
— Steve Steer (@Somst_Fruitcake) July 7, 2021
 




ITV was the only way for UK viewers to watch the game, which likely resulted in unusually large numbers of people trying to join the stream via ITV Hub. Nevertheless, streaming from ITV Hub on other devices appeared to be unaffected. ITV has since apologized to viewers over the experience.



The historic Euro 2020 final between England and Italy will be streamed via both BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub in the UK on Sunday, which should reduce the load on the stream, and at least provide viewers with an alternative if one of them suffers from issues. England fans will nevertheless have had reason to celebrate yesterday in spite of the problems with ITV Hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's senior VP of software and services Eddy Cue has joined the Board of Trustees at Duke University in North Carolina, institution officials have announced.





Cue earned bachelor's degrees in computer science and economics at Duke University. He is also an avid Duke basketball fan, and both of his sons Adam and Spencer also studied Computer Science at Duke University.



Cue joins six other new trustees joining the board on a six-year term. All are previous students of the institution who have gone on to establish successful business careers. Like the other trustees, Cue will be responsible for the school's educational mission and fiscal policies.



According to the university's press release, Cue has returned to Duke many times to assist students in technology fields, and in 2017 he spoke to the Duke Technology Scholars, which aims to inspire more Duke women undergraduates to choose careers in computer science and electrical and computer engineering. 



Cue has been at Apple since 1989 and as a member of the company's executive team he oversees Apple TV+, the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Maps, and iCloud. Eddy helped create the original Apple online store in 1998, the iTunes Store in 2003 and the App Store in 2008. He also played a key role in developing Apple's iLife suite of productivity apps.

good examples. I haven’t seen a lot written about how to make examples, so
here’s a little bit about my approach to writing examples!
The basic idea here is to start with real code that you wrote and then remove
irrelevant details to make it into a self-contained example instead of coming
up with examples out of thin air.
I’ll talk about two kinds of examples: realistic examples and suprising
examples.
good examples are realistic
To see why examples should be realistic, let’s first talk about an unrealistic
example! Let’s say we’re trying to explain Python lambdas (which is just the
first concept I thought of). You could give this example, of using map and a
lambda to double a set of numbers.

*Anyway, the Flyers. What if the Kraken take Ghost? [BSH]
*It will be no surprise to you that the Flyers appear as a potential landing spot for some of the big names on the block this summer. [The Athletic]
*We’re deep in the mushy middle of this year’s draft board and up next is a kid that has the most valuable asset of them all: size. [BSH]
*Let’s see how Ron Hextall graded out during his first few months as General Manager of those Penguins. [Pensburgh]
*Owen Power saw the Sabres win the draft lottery and thought to himself, “yeah staying in college for another year isn’t a bad idea.” [The Canadian Press]
*We didn’t see a ton from the big-name defensemen in these Final games. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Should the league think about making the nets bigger? There alway seems to be a clamoring for more goals. Not sure we really need more goals. [The Hockey News]
*And finally, remember that video of Senators players in a cab saying negative (true) things about the Ottawa organization? Unbelievably, it seems to have completely derailed the career of one of the players that was present. THAT is the thing that gets you blackballed from the NHL. Not all the... other stuff. Sheesh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nanoleaf, the company that makes wall-mounted modular light panels in various shapes, today rolled out Thread border router support for its Shapes and Elements light panels, which can be arranged in multiple positions.





As a quick explainer, Thread is a low latency and low power mesh-like network for smart devices. Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn't depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.



Apple's HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.



The new Nanoleaf Thread border router support also means Android users will be able to control the Essentials devices, too. Other devices that work with Thread include smart home products from Eve, the Nest Hub Max, and Nest Wi-Fi by Google.

        <updated>2021-07-07T22:05:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Maps received several notable improvements in iOS 15, including new details in cities, an interactive globe, and enhanced driving directions. It also gained a feature that has long been available in rival map apps – the ability to set leaving and arrival times for driving directions.





This is a feature that's long been available for Google Maps, and one that's really useful if you have a journey planned in the near future and you want to know how long it's going to take to get there or when you need to leave in order to arrive at a particular time.



Until now, there was no way to get estimated travel times in advance of a trip using the ‌‌Apple Maps‌‌ app. In previous versions of iOS, leaving and arrival time input was limited to directions for public transportation, but Apple has thankfully now expanded the option to driving, putting it on a more level playing field with Google Maps in the battle for users.



The following steps explain how to make use of the new leaving and arrival times on iPhones and iPads running ‌iOS 15‌ and iPadOS 15 or later.


In ‌Apple Maps‌' search field, enter your destination and tap Search.


Tap the Driving directions button.


Tap Leaving Now.



Using the Leave at and Arrive by tabs, select a time and date.


Tap Done.


‌Apple Maps‌ will show you several directions and how long it will take you to get to your destination based on predicted traffic for the time and date you selected.

 After over a year of delays, Dota 2’s upcoming tournament, The International 10 has been moved to a new venue in a new country. The event, which was originally supposed to happen in Stockholm, Sweden, will now be held in Bucharest, Romania, Valve announced on Wednesday. 
Valve started working with Sweden to host the 2020 tournament a year ahead of time in 2019. As the summer-set event got closer, it became clear that it would have to be put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, which pushed the tournament from 2020 to 2021 — something many tournaments and events like the Olympics and the European Soccer Championships faced as well. After the delay, the tournament was eventually rescheduled for August 2021. 
However, according to a post from Valve last month, despite several assurances over the previous year, the Swedish Sports Federation voted not to accept esports into its federation and Valve’s game was denied classification as an elite sporting event, meaning that Visa applications for players outside of the European Union would not be approved. 
Instead, players’ entry into the country would be subject to the approval of individual border agents. This called teams’ abilities to field their full rosters into question and made it impossible to guarantee the tournament’s integrity, so on June 21, Valve chose to delay the tournament and move it to a new location. 
On Wednesday, Valve announced that The International 10 — Dota 2 Championships will officially be held at the Arena Nationala in Bucharest, Romania starting on Oct. 7 and concluding on Oct. 17. The tournament’s new venue can seat up to 55,000 fans normally, but it remains to be seen how Valve will set it up for The International — though the developer did say that ticket information will be available soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drag has always been a world of aspirations and contradictions, playing not just on gender, but on race, power, wealth, and respectability. So in some sense, it’s not surprising that being a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race and its affiliated series is remarkably expensive:
“I spent more coming into this competition than I did as the down payment on my house,” Kameron says, her tone serious now.
“I spent more on this competition than I did on college,” Cracker replies solemnly, and a moment of silence falls over both queens. 


Contestants estimate that the cost of all the outfits in a current season of the show is between $20,000 and $30,000. This is five to six times as much as the earlier, more low-budget seasons.
But perhaps this is a case of some well-bankrolled contestants getting ov…]]></summary>

More souls, more problems
 World of Warcraft players have been battling against the nefarious Jailer since the start of Shadowlands, but the Sanctum of Domination raid is the first time we get to really spend any length of time with the big guy himself. The raid ends with a fight against Sylvanas Windrunner, a former hero of the Horde, as she makes sure the Jailer can carry out his dark plan. Despite the high fantasy setting, the supernatural realms of death, and the orchestral music that plays throughout, the end cinematic feels more like a scene from Passions than Warcraft.

Here’s an example of a great newsletter about a game I do not know well: Graham Nelson’s Curses, from 1993. Curses, Reed, argues, emerges at an unlikely moment (surrounded by emerging CD-ROM games and exploding console popularity) to bring about an equally unlikely renaissance of interactive fiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad today debuted its latest product, a Leather Cover that's designed to work with Apple's MagSafe Charger. The Leather Cover is meant to slide over a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, providing a more attractive design for those who use Apple's charging solution.





The Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ is available in rustic brown and black Horween leather, and each cover has a soft microfiber exterior that does not do any damage to the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger.



Nomad designed the Leather Cover to fit snugly to the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, but it does add a little bit of extra size, which Nomad says makes the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger easier to grip and remove from an iPhone.





Like all of Nomad's leather products, the Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ will develop a rich, unique patina over time with use. These Leather Covers also match well with Nomad's Leather ‌iPhone‌ cases because it's the same material.



Nomad's Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ is priced at $24.95 and can be purchased from the Nomad website.

I've been a fan of GM's infotainment systems for a while now, as I find they have an intuitive, modern interface that keeps things simple and comes closer to replicating a smartphone feel than systems from many other manufacturers.





I've subsequently had a chance to try out another GM vehicle with wireless ‌CarPlay‌, and that's the 2021 Cadillac Escalade with its high-end OLED Infotainment System, an all-new system that bears essentially no resemblance to other current GM infotainment systems.

Former president Donald Trump on Wednesday filed class-action
lawsuits targeting Facebook, Google and Twitter and their CEOs,
escalating his long-running battle with the companies following
their suspensions of his accounts. […]
The suits allege that the companies violated Trump’s First
Amendment rights in suspending his accounts and argues that
Facebook, in particular, no longer should be considered a private
company but “a state actor” whose actions are constrained by First
Amendment restrictions on government limitations on free speech.
Traditionally, the First Amendment is thought to constrain only
government actions, not those of private companies.
They should respond with Randall Munroe’s classic XKCD comic on “free speech”. That’s it, that’s their entire legal response.

 The modder who took out the gratuitous butt shots from Mass Effect 2 and 3 has now put them back in. 
It’s a comedic twist that has brought a long-running video game drama full circle. Scottina123, whose mod published last winter discreetly removed all the close-up shots of Miranda’s butt from the original Mass Effect series, now offers a mod that puts all the butt shots back into Mass Effect Legendary Edition. In the development of Legendary Edition, BioWare’s developers subtly acknowledged some of their questionable camera choices in the original games and changed the scenes for the remastered release.

He’s a Big Boy that can go anywhere from the mid-first to the early-second round.
 The big thing that disrupted every single life on this planet — you know what I’m talking about — certainly had its effect on professional sports and most significantly on the prospect that aren’t quite professional yet.
Young teenage hockey players were either left with no league to play in, a delayed season, or a season that was full of pauses due to quarantines and outbreaks — not the best experiences for players trying to impress NHL scouts enough to be selected this July. And one of the leagues that just straight up didn’t resume was the Ontario Hockey League, one of the prime destinations for scouts to check out the top available talents in any season.

Break kneecaps, make money, cause problems
 The next Red Dead Online update, Blood Money, is all about kicking ass and taking money. Blood Money starts off in the city of Saint Denis, and has players team up with an underworld power player. Unlike previous updates like the frontier roles, there is no starting cost; players can just jump into the missions without acquiring gold bars. The Blood Money update will begin on July 13.
Cowboys can embark on a new mission type called Crimes, which can be completed solo or as part of a Posse. Sometimes, you might be stopping a coach and robbing the passengers, and other missions are a multi-stage robbery with debt collecting, kidnapping, and other unsavory methods. This is all done in pursuit of a new kind of currency called Capitale, which has been stolen and distributed among the common low lives of the West. Players can earn Capitale through Crimes, or find innocent people with Capitale in free roam, at which point you can rob them and take that sweet, sweet currency.
The second new mission type is called Opportunities. Once a player accumulates enough Capitale, underworld contact Guido Martelli will send you out into the world to rob, undermine, and kneecap a rising politician. The first Opportunities will launch with Blood Money on July 13; more will come in future.
Blood Money will come with a new variation on the game’s season pass called the Quick Draw Club, which divides the usual structure up into four shorter tracks. Pamphlets previously available through the season pass that offer in-game benefits will be placed on sale at the Fence, so they can be acquired much more easily. 
Finally, on July 13 both Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption 2 will offer Nvidia DLSS support for anyone on PC with eligible Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards. That’s a nice way to upgrade an already beautiful game, and re-explore the story campaign or take a look at Online’s new content.]]></summary>

Akshan is a ranged champion with a grappling hook, but the most interesting part of his kit is the passive on his W. When an enemy champion kills one of Akshan’s allies, that enemy gets marked as a Scoundrel. Akshan gets special bonuses against Scoundrels while they’re alive, but if he kills one, whoever the Scoundrel killed is immediately revived at their fountain.

The enigmatic defenseman has shown flashes of brilliance pulled back down to Earth by equaled bouts of inconsistency. 
 Our look at feasible targets for the Seattle Kraken in this month’s expansion draft began with James van Riemsdyk, and today we’ll continue by looking into a slightly less costly option for the NHL’s newest club.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Listen before we get to anything else we need to address this alternate logo the Flyers explored in the 90s. [BarDown]
*Anyhoo, tonight is another ‘this might be the end’ game, Game 5 down in Tampa. The Habs were up against it Monday and they got it done. Why not again? [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*We’re all (rightfully) focused on how Chuck is going to improve the team at the top this summer, but what about bringing a little more to the bottom too? [BSH]
*Charlie dives deep on James van Riemsdyk, who many have pegged as the guy Seattle will take in the upcoming draft. [The Athletic]
*Most of those draft-prediction articles came before the Dave Hakstol hire, though. What if Dave steers the Kraken toward taking one of our defensemen instead? [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of defensemen, the league buyout window opens soon and a couple of guys are eligible. Would the Flyers buy anyone out though? It’d be a weird move. [BSH]
*Next up on the Community Draft Board: a Swede with a cool name. [BSH]
*The Flyers might have a bit more competition in the defense market than we expected. [The Hockey News]
*This is pretty neat; a tiny Danish town has produced FIVE NHLers and someone decided to make a movie about it. [ProHockeyTalk]
*A couple of teams have signed players to league-max eight-year contracts in the last couple of weeks, so it’s worth looking at whether that’s a good idea or not. [TSN]
*And finally, if you’re into stats and science and maths and such, the fine folks at Hockey Graphs continue to do really interesting work on the myriad parts of NHL hockey. [Hockey Graphs]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is working to allow smaller meetings to take place in its Together Mode, which uses artificial intelligence to put multiple users in the same virtual space.





Launched last year during the peak of the global health crisis, Together Mode for meetings uses AI to place everyone on a call in a shared room-like environment, like a coffee shop or an auditorium, rather than the patchwork gallery view that typically comprises large Teams meetings. 



The idea behind the feature is to better replicate real face-to-face meetings by taking people out of their home environments and custom backgrounds, thereby making it easier to pick up on facial expressions, body language, and other non-verbal cues.



Together Mode can accommodate up to 49 people at a time, and currently only becomes available when at least five people have joined the meeting. Soon, however, Microsoft is making it so that the feature can be used with just two people.




Love the fact I can use together mode in #MicrosoftTeams with only two people when I'm on the developer preview 😍
I'm almost never in meetings with 5 or more people🙄 
Great change 🌠 pic.twitter.com/86bAitGBTW
— 💫🌙 Amanda Sterner 💫🌙 (@amandassterner) July 1, 2021
 


Support for smaller gatherings in Together Mode is currently limited to the developer Beta preview, but will soon be available for all. If you want to try accessing the preview, click the ellipsis next to your profile picture, select About, then tick Developer Preview. If the option doesn't appear, it may be because of the way your work account is set up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has expanded several iPadOS 14 Apple Pencil features to additional languages, improving ‌Apple Pencil‌ functionality for those who write in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.





According to Apple's iOS and iPadOS Feature Availability page, these languages can now be used when copying handwriting as text and there's also data detector support.



That means if you write something in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, you can now copy the handwritten text and paste it as standard typed text, and addresses and other content written in these languages will also show up as interactive and clickable.





Both Copy Handwriting as Text and Data Detectors were already available for the English and Chinese languages, but have expanded much more broadly. Various dialects are supported including French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (Switzerland), French (France), German (Austria), German (Germany), German (Switzerland), Italian (Switzerland), Italian (Italy), Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), and Spanish (Mexico).



Apple earlier this year introduced Apple Pencil Scribble support for these same languages, allowing German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese speakers to write in their native language across iPadOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reese Witherspoon-owned media company Hello Sunshine is considering a sale, and Apple is one of the interested parties, reports The Wall Street Journal.





Apple already works with Hello Sunshine on popular Apple TV+ series "The Morning Show," which stars Witherspoon. Hello Sunshine is also involved in several upcoming ‌Apple TV+‌ shows like "Surface" starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, "The Last Thing He Told Me" with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series "My Kind of Country."



Hello Sunshine reportedly began pursuing a sale in the last couple of months and has received interest from multiple suitors, one of which is Apple. The company could be valued at as much as $1 billion, due to hits like the aforementioned series "The Morning Show" and also "Big Little Lies" and "Little Fires Everywhere."



The production company is working with investment bankers to explore its options, and there is no guarantee that it will be sold, nor that Apple will purchase it.



If Apple does indeed purchase Hello Sunshine, it could ultimately be folded into Apple Studios, Apple's own production company that is involved with some of its ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. Apple Studios is thus far working on "Surface," "Snow Blind" with Jake Gyllenhaal, "Emancipation" with Will Smith, and "Killers of the Flower Moon" with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple has added a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera's viewfinder or in a photo you've taken and let you perform several actions with it.





For example, if you take a picture of a storefront that displays a phone number, you can capture that number to place a call or add to your contacts. You can also copy Live Text from your photos for making use of elsewhere. It's an incredibly simple, useful feature, and here's how it works in its simplest form.




Launch the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad.


Find a photo that has some words on show, such as a restaurant menu or product tag.


Pinch to zoom the photo if the text appears small.


Press and hold on the words, then drag the ends of the selection tool to highlight all the text that you want to copy.


Take your finger off the screen, then select Copy from the contextual popup menu.


Finally, switch to an app that supports text input, press and hold your finger where the cursor is located, then select Paste from the popup menu.




Did you know that Live Text also features optical character recognition? That means if you have a picture of a handwritten note in your photos, you can still copy it and then paste it as digital text.



Live Photos also works with the camera app and other images on the ‌iPhone‌, plus there are other features in addition to copy/paste including Look Up and Translate, so you can translate foreign language text found in a photo. Live Text works with the Spotlight search on the ‌iPhone‌ as well, which lets text in photos be located through a standard ‌iPhone‌ search.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The galaxy is wild. Our solar system, with its surprising abundance of living creatures and nonstop radiation and asteroid showers, is a placid, private garden compared to the rest of it. 
In particular, there are perhaps trillions of rogue planets (planetary bodies ranging from little rocky Earth-sized guys to super-Jupiter gas giants) in the Milky Way, including a surprisingly large fleet of the things right near the galactic core.
This is unusual, since the typical way we detect exoplanets is by marking their repeated procession across a star. But rogue planets, by definition, don’t orbit stars. So the way astronomers find them is a little different, requiring use of gravitational microlensing.
Gizmodo breaks it down:
Data gathered by NASA’s now-retired Kepler Space Telescope has revealed a small population of free-floating planets near the Galactic Bulge. The new finding raises hope that a pair of upcoming missions will result in further detections of unbound planets, which drift through space separated from their home stars….
It’s impossible to know what the conditions are like on these presumed rogue exoplanets, but [astronomer Iain] McDonald said they could be “cold, icy wastelands,” and, if similar in size to Earth, their surfaces would “closely resemble bodies in the outer Solar System, like Pluto.”
The new paper suggests the presence of a large population of Earth-sized rogue planets in the Milky Way. It’s becoming clear that free-floating planets are common. McDonald said his team is currently working to come up with a more precise estimate for how many of them might exist.


Did you catch that part about how McDonald’s team made this discovery using a now-retired telescope? Yeah. Apparently the new telescope projects coming online are both more powerful and (in particular) better equipped to detect gravitational lensing effects, and therefore more likely to detect rogue planets in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fermi’s paradox is fairly well known: given what we know about the chance of intelligent life appearing somewhere in the universe, why haven’t any other species to date so far made contact with humanity? You can formalize the paradox via the Drake equation or some other method, but that’s the crux of it.
What’s less clear is how Enrico Fermi originally phrased the paradox. At Language Log, Mark Lieberman points out that each of the participants in the original conversation remembers it differently:
At lunch, Fermi suddenly exclaimed, “Where are they?” (Teller’s remembrance), or “Don’t you ever wonder where everybody is?” (York’s remembrance), or “But where is everybody?” (Konopinski’s remembrance).
As Liberman writes, “our memory of exact word sequences usually fades more quickly than our memory of (contextually interpreted) meanings. More broadly, the exact auditory sensations normally fade very quickly; the corresponding word sequences fade a bit more slowly; and the interpreted meanings last longest.” 
My own favorite (for purely aesthetic reasons) is “where is everybody?” It just kind of says everything you want such an observation to say.

Eliksni Hatchling lets Guardians live their Destiny Sim dreams
 Destiny 2’s Fallen babies took the world by storm early this summer when the studio launched Season of the Splicer. The adorable refugees have been living in the Tower for some time, but thanks to a new emote, players can finally Rafiki their way into the lives of the four-eyed infants. 
Thanks to Destiny 2’s new Solstice of Heroes update, Guardians can finally get their hands on a Fallen baby of their own. The emote is called Eliksni Hatchling, and it’s exactly what you want. Players manifest a holographic Fallen baby into their hands and lift it into the sky, just like the opening of the Lion King when Rafiki shows Simba off to the Pride Lands.
Image: Bungie via Polygon
      The Eliksni baby blinks and gets very excited once you lift it
  
The emote’s name, Eliksni Hatchling, uses the term “Eliksni” instead of “Fallen.” In the world of Destiny, Eliksni is the proper name for the Fallen race, and what they choose to call themselves. The Eliksni Quarter — where most of the Fallen babies are hanging out during Season of the Splicer — uses the same term. The term Fallen has always been a “nickname” for the “evil” Eliksni, and the Eliksni that are currently in the Last City seem to view it as a pejorative term.
The Eliksni Hatchling emote will run players 1,000 Silver — a common price for an Exotic emote. Players can purchase 1,100 Silver via Steam or other platform stores for $9.99. Today  In Destiny — a website that can tell players when Eververse items will go on sale for the earnable Bright Dust currency — doesn’t show the Eliksni Hatchling emote showing up for anything other than Silver for the rest of the season. However, the schedule does have some classified items on it, so the emote could show up for Bright Dust later on in the season.]]></summary>

Publisher Nacon pegs RoboCop: Rogue City for 2023 release
 A new RoboCop video game is in development and slated for release in 2023, publisher Nacon announced Tuesday during a livestream called Nacon Connect. Titled RoboCop: Rogue City, the first-person shooter will put players in the total body prosthesis of Alex Murphy, aka RoboCop, on a mission to protect Detroit.
Beyond that, Nacon and developer Teyon didn’t reveal much about RoboCop: Rogue City, other than that it’s destined for PC and unspecified consoles in a couple years. Rogue City will feature an original story in the franchise’s universe, Nacon said in a news release. The publisher and developer are working with studio MGM to “develop an authentic RoboCop game experience that is faithful to the franchise’s DNA,” Nacon said.
Teyon certainly has experience bringing ’80s action heroes to video games. The Polish studio is perhaps best known for its work on Terminator: Resistance, the 2019 shooter based on the Terminator franchise that wasn’t the worst thing ever, and Rambo: The Video Game, a 2014 rail shooter that was, frankly, pretty awful. A teaser trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City hints at something similarly low budget and perhaps a bit janky, but still shows promise.
RoboCop’s had a rough go of it in the video game space. Outside of the movie-to-arcade adaptation created by Data East in 1988, Murphy’s mostly starred in mediocre console games and free-to-play mobile fare (and one Mortal Kombat game) over the past few decades. Here’s hoping that Nacon (formerly known as Bigben Interactive) and Teyon will turn things around for ol’ Robo for his next adventure.
As for RoboCop’s next cinematic adventure, a planned direct sequel was in the works with director Neill Blomkamp, who left the project shortly after it was announced.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[United States President Joe Biden plans to direct the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to create new right to repair rules that would affect tech companies like Apple, reports Bloomberg.





The rules would prevent manufacturers from limiting consumers' options for repairing products at independent repair shops or on their own, and the presidential directive is expected to mention mobile phone developers as an area for possible regulation. The FTC will be able to decide on the size and the scope of the order, so it is not yet clear how Apple might be impacted.



Multiple states have proposed right to repair legislation, which Apple has continually lobbied against. Apple claims that allowing independent repair shops to work on Apple devices without oversight would lead to security,…]]></summary>

It turns out that this is useful for other species who like to radically alter their habitats, like humans. Let’s say you’ve got a dried out flood plain in California you want to restore in order to mitigate the effects of a drought, or even to help stop wildfires. Why not hire some beavers? 
The Doty Ravine project cost about $58,000, money that went toward preparing the site for beavers to do their work.
In comparison, a traditional constructed restoration project using heavy equipment across that much land could cost $1 to $2 million, according to Batt…

How to level your armor up in 2021
 Destiny 2’s fourth annual Solstice of Heroes event is here, and it brings a grind similar to the last several years from July 6 – Aug. 3, 2021. Players begin with a “Renewed” armor set and get the task of leveling up to a “Majestic” armor set and eventually a “Magnificent” armor set. 
During this Solstice of Heroes, players can make their Magnificent armor glow without purchasing special items from the in-game Eververse store — a white glow, just like last year. However, players who do purchase the Eververse glows will get Universal Ornaments — meaning it’s a look players can apply to any armor piece — that glows depending on their current subclass. This includes the new Stasis subclass from last year’s Beyond Light expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Henri-Gold on Twitter:
Today’s vibe: scrapped WWDC 2014 intro film feat. Larry David, JB
Smoove, and Evan Spiegel.
What a find. It’s effectively a 10-minute mini-episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David as Apple’s head of app review for the App Store. Henri-Gold posted a 53-second clip to Twitter, but wrote:
The whole thing exists out there. I’m holding off on sharing the
link to protect the party who inadvertently released it; I don’t
want to cause any harm to their business over this. I encourage
you to not publicly share the link either. Thanks for
understanding.
A little late for that — the full version that was posted to Vimeo was pulled overnight. The whole video is funny in exactly the way Curb is funny, but Curb Your Enthusiasm-style humor is not Apple-style humor — and the difference has only widened since 2014. I don’t know how this project got so far, but the humor is such that I don’t see how Apple could possibly have used it, even in 2014. One joke that might have played as funny in 2014 but wouldn’t in 2021 is the central conceit of the video — that Apple’s head of app review is a capricious jerk who makes approval decisions based on inscrutable whims.

With the first buyout window of the summer coming, Philadelphia can sacrifice some contracts.
 Frank Seravelli put out a quick list of potential buyout candidates this summer and with the first buyout window opening up just 24 hours after the Stanley Cup is awarded (probably to the Tampa Bay Lightning) the list is an intriguing one. A name certainly made my eyes bulge out of my head in a depressing way and not an a-wooga cartoonish way. He named Philippe Myers as a buyout option to keep an eye on.
With no further explanation or blurb to defend himself with, I’m treating this as a piece of useless trash information but it did at least spur my aging, rusty gears of a brain to think of other potential buyout candidates on the Philadelphia Flyers. Myers …]]></summary>

An Avengers-style team of heroes from around the world of League are teaming up to fight off Viego and his mind controlled army of mist and monsters.

Olausson spent this season jumping around between levels in Sweden, but wherever he was placed, he seemed to find success. He’s a quick, skilled winger with a dynamic offensive game, and there’s a whole lot to like about his skillset. Let’s get into it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kensington today unveiled its new StudioCaddy, a modular, multi-device charger that works with iPhones, AirPods, iPads, and Macs. The StudioCaddy is aimed at households that have multiple Apple products and want a single convenient place to keep them organized and charged up.

Design wise, the StudioCaddy is uncomplicated, with a streamlined look that fits in well with any decor. It's made from materials like plastic, aluminum, and a stitched fabric, and it feels like it has a durable build quality. The different pieces of the dock connect magnetically together.



There's a Qi-based charging station for the iPhone and the ‌AirPods‌, featuring a vertical Qi wireless charging spot for the ‌iPhone‌ and a flat spot for the ‌AirPods‌ or AirPods Pro. Since this is just Qi, either of these spots can also be used for other devices too. For iOS devices, charging maxes out at 7.5W, but 10W charging is available for Android devices.



At the side, there's a USB-C and and a USB-A port for charging additional devices, and you can use these with the laptop and tablet stand of the StudioCaddy. A MacBook or an iPad can fit into one of the StudioCaddy's storage slots, charging through the attached cables, which are sold separately.



The tablet/laptop stand works with any size MacBook, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is convenient if you need an overnight storage spot. You can leave the StudioCaddy's pieces attached together magnetically or separate them out across your desk for a custom setup.



Kensington is charging $179 for the StudioCaddy, which is expensive, but it is a solid multi-device charging station for those who need an all-in-one solution. More information is available on the Kensington website.

He would be a decent option.
 Whenever a situation arises where both a player and team are dissatisfied with how events have progressed, it is usually best for a change of scenery. In such situations, a window of opportunity opens up for other teams to provide a chance to said player to re-write themselves.
With Warren Foegele, he appears to be headed in that direction.
In the “31 Thoughts” blog, Elliotte Friedman reported that there are trade discussions being had over Foegele, with both player and team wanting “a change”. Similar sounding rumors have arisen with the Flyers regarding Nolan Patrick, and though there’s no guarantee either player gets moved, once the news that both player and team want a change is public, it almost becomes…]]></summary>

UFC 4, The Medium, and Tropico 6 are on the way, too
 Microsoft has announced six more games coming to Xbox Game Pass in July 2021: Dragon Quest Builders 2, Tropico 6, EA Sports UFC 4, Bloodroots, The Medium, and Farming Simulator 9. These game will roll out on different platforms across July.
Here’s the full breakdown from the Xbox Wire:
Dragon Quest Builders 2 (cloud) — July 8
Tropico 6 (cloud, console, and PC) — July 8
UFC 4 (console via EA Play) — July 8
Bloodroots (cloud, console, and PC) — July 15
Farming Simulator 19 (cloud, console, and PC) — July 15
The Medium (cloud) — July 15
Last month, Microsoft added a whole bunch of games, including Gang Beasts and Limbo. As always, games must leave Xbox Game Pass when new comes are welcomed. This month, EA Sports UFC and EA Sports UFC 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass via EA Play on July 14, while Endless Space, Downwell, and CrossCode will depart on July 15.
Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service from Microsoft — and a dang good deal. There are plenty of games available for the subscription price, with more added every month. In June, Microsoft said it’ll bring “at least one new, first-party game into Game Pass” in each quarter of the year. Xbox Game Pass is $1 a month for the first three months; after that, it costs $9.99 a month on either PC or consoles, whereas the Ultimate tier, which includes both, goes for $14.99 per month.
Subscribers that have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also have access to Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming platform, which is now available on Apple devices and Windows PC via browsers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook is attending the Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho this week alongside many high-profile guests, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to NPR. Described as a "summer camp for billionaires," the annual media conference is hosted by private investment firm Allen & Company and allows media and tech moguls to negotiate deals in between leisure activities such as golfing and whitewater rafting.




Apple CEO Tim Cook at a previous Sun Valley Conference


Variety previously revealed the guest list for this year's conference. In addition to Cook and Zuckerberg, notable invitees included billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone, "Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, Dell CEO Michael Dell, and others. However, the report noted that not everyone on the guest list chooses to attend.



After being canceled last year due to the pandemic, the Sun Valley Conference returns this year with health and safety measures in place, with attendees required to present a negative PCR test result obtained within 72 hours prior to arrival, according to Vanity Fair. The report added that many presentations and events will take place outdoors.



Cook has attended the Sun Valley Conference multiple times, often alongside Apple's services chief Eddy Cue. While details are typically kept under wraps, it was recently reported that during a private meeting at the conference in 2019, Cook urged Zuckerberg to delete all user information Facebook had collected from third-party apps.



With so many media executives gathering in one place, the Sun Valley Conference likely provides Cook with an opportunity to negotiate Apple TV+ content deals. Should any details emerge from this year's conference, we will share them.

On Twitter, Dylandkt claimed that a new ‌MacBook Air‌ model is "on track" to launch in the first half of 2022, featuring an ‌M2‌ chip and a more colorful design. They also claimed that the "M1X" chip is being reserved for high-end "Pro" Macs, which could include the MacBook Pro and a larger, more powerful iMac model. 




Just wanted to share some details on when to expect the next generation ‌M2‌ (not the M1X which is reserved for the Pro Mac devices). This processor is on track to release in the first half of 2022 alongside the upcoming colorful Macbook (Air).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've installed the public beta of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey on any of your devices, you may have already tried out some of the new features Apple has added to the Notes app, such as the ability to use @ user mentions in shared notes and the long-desired support for tags. 





However, some users have discovered that notes containing instances of these two new features don't show up in some earlier versions of iOS and macOS, so it's best just to stay away from them if you have any other devices still running older versions of Apple's desktop or mobile operating systems.



As reported by 9to5Mac, if the Notes app identifies a device in your iCloud account running a version earlier than iOS 14.5 or macOS 11.3, it will alert you to the fact that tagged notes or notes containing mentions will be hidden on those devices. 



On the plus side, if your other devices are fully up-to-date and running iOS 14.5 or macOS Big Sur 11.3 or later, then it appears that any notes using @ mentions or tags are able to be opened by those versions.



As always with beta software, it's inadvisable to install these version on devices that you rely on for work or anything else important, especially if you're using multiple devices on the same Apple account, this example being a case in point.

 It’s not that modern historians of the medieval Mediterranean, Europe and Africa have been ignorant about contacts between Ethiopia and Europe; the issue was that they had the power dynamic reversed. The traditional narrative stressed Ethiopia as weak and in trouble in the face of aggression from external forces, especially the Mamluks in Egypt, so Ethiopia sought military assistance from their fellow Christians to the north—th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the fifth anniversary of Pokémon GO launching on iPhone, allowing people to get out in the world and catch Pokémon using augmented reality, and developer Niantic is celebrating with several in-app events over the next week and a bit.





Between Tuesday, July 6 at 10:00 a.m. and Thursday, July 15 at 8:00 p.m. local time, players will have the chance to capture a Flying Pikachu with a 5-shaped balloon in the wild, and Darumaka will also be appearing more frequently. Fireworks will also be returning to the Pokémon GO map in celebration of the fifth anniversary of the game.



Niantic outlined the complete in-game events and bonuses that will be available during the celebration week in a blog post. Players are advised to be aware of their surroundings and follow guidelines from local health authorities when playing Pokémon GO.



Pokémon GO has received several major updates over the last five years, including an improved AR+ experience, Raid Battles, Field Research, and more. The game can be downloaded for free on the App Store, with PokéCoins and other in-app purchases available.

50 years ago today, Louis Armstrong made his final reel-to-reel tape. After concluding it with “April in Paris” from the “Ella and Louis” album, he went to sleep and passed away. This video contains the final minute of “April in Paris,” directly transferred from that last tape. pic.twitter.com/9zq9jWtiPj

For a variety of reasons, I recently found myself inside a legal marijuana dispensary for the first time. I wasn’t sure exactly what I expected the retail experience to be like — a liquor store? a coffee shop? a used car lot? the paraphrenelia shops I first checked out as a teenager? — but I was nevertheless surprised. 
The closest analogy I can think of is a jewelry store. There was pretty decent security, including a whole separate room for customers to check in, and everything was presented in a secure display case. A salesperson walked you through the samples to answer questions, guide you in one direction or another, and take y…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patience Haggin, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
After the tracking change took effect in April, many users of Apple’s iOS operating system have received a high volume of prompts from apps asking permission to track them—requests that most have declined. Less than 33% of iOS users opt in to tracking, according to ad-measurement firm Branch Metrics Inc.
As a result, the prices for mobile ads directed at iOS users have fallen, while ad prices have risen for advertisers seeking to target Android users. […]
Digital-ad agency Tinuiti Inc. has seen a similar pattern in its clients’ spending, research director Andy Taylor said. When iOS users opted out of tracking, Tinuiti advertisers couldn’t bid on them, he said. That dearth of iOS users drove up demand—and ad prices—for Android users. About 72.8% of smartphones world-wide use the Android operating system, and about 26.4% use iOS, according to Statcounter.
Tinuiti’s Facebook clients went from year-over-year spend growth of 46% for Android users in May to 64% in June. The clients’ iOS spending saw a corresponding slowdown, from 42% growth in May to 25% in June. Android ad prices are now about 30% higher than ad prices for iOS users, Mr. Taylor said.
If any part of this is surprising, it’s the claim that as many as one-third of iOS users have opted in to tracking.

Can a wireless gaming mouse be good for esports?
 I use to equate the quality of esports mice with garish looks, bulky construction, and fancy button configurations. However, my favorite mouse of the last few years, the Logitech G Pro Wireless, is the exact opposite of that aesthetic. It’s simple and understated. It feels so light, you would be excused for thinking it was just a regular office mouse. But the technology packed inside its tiny frame makes it fast, accurate, and effortless to use.
This is why we think that the Logitech G Pro Wireless one of the best esports and FPS gaming mice out there.

The app in question is owned by Didi Global, which Apple has $1 billion invested in. Bloomberg reports that the ban was announced on Sunday by the Cyberspace Administration of China, citing serious violations on the company's collection and usage of personal information, without going into detail. 

The regulator on Sunday ordered Didi to rectify its problems following legal requirements and national standards, and take steps to protect the personal information of its users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular open-source audio editing software Audacity is facing "spyware" allegations from users for recent privacy policy changes that suggest the desktop app is collecting user data and sharing it with third parties, including state regulators where applicable.



Two months ago, Audacity was acquired by Muse Group, which owns other audio-related projects including the Ultimate Guitar website and the MuseScore app. According to Fosspost, changes to the privacy policy section on the Audacity website indicate that several personal data collection mechanisms have since been added by the parent company.



The type of data collected now includes the computer's processor, operating system and version, the user's IP address, and any crash reports, fatal error codes and messages generated by their machine. More concerning perhaps is the inclusion of a vague section listing data that must be collected "for legal enforcement, litigation, and authorities' requests (if any)."



The storage of said data is located in servers in the U.S., Russia, and the European Economic Area. For example, IP addresses are stored in an identifiable way for a day before being hashed and then stored in servers for a year, leaving users identifiable via government data requests.



In addition, the new policy prevents people under the age of 13 from using the software, which is a violation of the GPL license that Audacity uses. 



Understandably, the policy changes have upset Audacity users, who have taken to Reddit and GitHub to question why an offline desktop app needs to "phone home" at all, and there is already discussion about forking Audacity into a separate open-source project that's free from the Muse Group's ownership and questionable data collection practices.

Introduced in iOS 14.5, Apple's App Tracking Transparency rules require apps that access an iPhone's ad identifier or IDFA must ask a user's permission before tracking is allowed. As reported by the Financial Times in March, however, the change spurred ad and tech groups in China to develop a new way of tracking users without their consent, called CAID.



Along with the state-backed China Advertising Association (CAA), tech groups led by Baidu, Tencent, and TikTok parent ByteDance began testing CAID to see if it would let them identify users even if…]]></summary>
