        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Maps received several notable improvements in iOS 15, including new details in cities, an interactive globe, and enhanced driving directions. It also gained a feature that has long been available in rival map apps – the ability to set leaving and arrival times for driving directions.





This is a feature that's long been available for Google Maps, and one that's really useful if you have a journey planned in the near future and you want to know how long it's going to take to get there or when you need to leave in order to arrive at a particular time.



Until now, there was no way to get estimated travel times in advance of a trip using the ‌‌Apple Maps‌‌ app. In previous versions of iOS, leaving and arrival time input was limited to directions for public transportation, but Apple has thankfully now expanded the option to driving, putting it on a more level playing field with Google Maps in the battle for users.



The following steps explain how to make use of the new leaving and arrival times on iPhones and iPads running ‌iOS 15‌ and iPadOS 15 or later.


In ‌Apple Maps‌' search field, enter your destination and tap Search.


Tap the Driving directions button.


Tap Leaving Now.



Using the Leave at and Arrive by tabs, select a time and date.


Tap Done.


‌Apple Maps‌ will show you several directions and how long it will take you to get to your destination based on predicted traffic for the time and date you selected.

TI 10 is heading to Romania
 After over a year of delays, Dota 2’s upcoming tournament, The International 10 has been moved to a new venue in a new country. The event, which was originally supposed to happen in Stockholm, Sweden, will now be held in Bucharest, Romania, Valve announced on Wednesday. 
Valve started working with Sweden to host the 2020 tournament a year ahead of time in 2019. As the summer-set event got closer, it became clear that it would have to be put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, which pushed the tournament from 2020 to 2021 — something many tournaments and events like the Olympics and the European Soccer Championships faced as well. After the delay, the tournament was eventually rescheduled for August 2021. 
However, according to a post from Valve last month, despite several assurances over the previous year, the Swedish Sports Federation voted not to accept esports into its federation and Valve’s game was denied classification as an elite sporting event, meaning that Visa applications for players outside of the European Union would not be approved. 
Instead, players’ entry into the country would be subject to the approval of individual border agents. This called teams’ abilities to field their full rosters into question and made it impossible to guarantee the tournament’s integrity, so on June 21, Valve chose to delay the tournament and move it to a new location. 
On Wednesday, Valve announced that The International 10 — Dota 2 Championships will officially be held at the Arena Nationala in Bucharest, Romania starting on Oct. 7 and concluding on Oct. 17. The tournament’s new venue can seat up to 55,000 fans normally, but it remains to be seen how Valve will set it up for The International — though the developer did say that ticket information will be available soon.]]></summary>

So in some sense, it’s not surprising that being a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race and its affiliated series is remarkably expensive:
“I spent more coming into this competition than I did as the down payment on my house,” Kameron says, her tone serious now.
“I spent more on this competition than I did on college,” Cracker replies solemnly, and a moment of silence falls over both queens. 


Contestants estimate that the cost of all the outfits in a current season of the show is between $20,000 and $30,000. This is five to six times as much as the earlier, more low-budget seasons.
But perhaps this is a case of some well-bankrolled contestants getting ov…]]></summary>

More souls, more problems
 World of Warcraft players have been battling against the nefarious Jailer since the start of Shadowlands, but the Sanctum of Domination raid is the first time we get to really spend any length of time with the big guy himself. The raid ends with a fight against Sylvanas Windrunner, a former hero of the Horde, as she makes sure the Jailer can carry out his dark plan. Despite the high fantasy setting, the supernatural realms of death, and the orchestral music that plays throughout, the end cinematic feels more like a scene from Passions than Warcraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad today debuted its latest product, a Leather Cover that's designed to work with Apple's MagSafe Charger. The Leather Cover is meant to slide over a ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, providing a more attractive design for those who use Apple's charging solution.





The Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ is available in rustic brown and black Horween leather, and each cover has a soft microfiber exterior that does not do any damage to the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger.



Nomad designed the Leather Cover to fit snugly to the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, but it does add a little bit of extra size, which Nomad says makes the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger easier to grip and remove from an iPhone.





Like all of Nomad's leather products, the Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ will develop a rich, unique patina over time with use. These Leather Covers also match well with Nomad's Leather ‌iPhone‌ cases because it's the same material.



Nomad's Leather Cover for ‌MagSafe‌ is priced at $24.95 and can be purchased from the Nomad website.

Apple will enter the market with a 10.9-inch AMOLED ‌iPad‌, which prior sources have suggested could be an iPad Air.





There have been multiple reports about Apple's work on an OLED ‌iPad‌, and the sheer number of rumors all but confirm that the technology is in development. Right now, OLED displays are limited to Apple's iPhone lineup, the Apple Watch, and the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, but Apple has been working to bring OLED to Macs and iPads.



Most of the rumors that we've heard about an OLED ‌iPad‌ suggest that it's coming in 2022, which is earlier than the DSCC report predicts. The Elec recently said that Apple will rele…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cat Zakrzewski and Rachel Lerman, reporting for The Washington Post:
Former president Donald Trump on Wednesday filed class-action
lawsuits targeting Facebook, Google and Twitter and their CEOs,
escalating his long-running battle with the companies following
their suspensions of his accounts. […]
The suits allege that the companies violated Trump’s First
Amendment rights in suspending his accounts and argues that
Facebook, in particular, no longer should be considered a private
company but “a state actor” whose actions are constrained by First
Amendment restrictions on government limitations on free speech.
Traditionally, the First Amendment is thought to constrain only
government actions, not those of private companies.
They should respond with Randall Munroe’s classic XKCD comic on “free speech”. That’s it, that’s their entire legal response.

He’s a Big Boy that can go anywhere from the mid-first to the early-second round.
 The big thing that disrupted every single life on this planet — you know what I’m talking about — certainly had its effect on professional sports and most significantly on the prospect that aren’t quite professional yet.
Young teenage hockey players were either left with no league to play in, a delayed season, or a season that was full of pauses due to quarantines and outbreaks — not the best experiences for players trying to impress NHL scouts enough to be selected this July. And one of the leagues that just straight up didn’t resume was the Ontario Hockey League, one of the prime destinations for scouts to check out the top available talents in any season.

Break kneecaps, make money, cause problems
 The next Red Dead Online update, Blood Money, is all about kicking ass and taking money. Blood Money starts off in the city of Saint Denis, and has players team up with an underworld power player. Unlike previous updates like the frontier roles, there is no starting cost; players can just jump into the missions without acquiring gold bars. The Blood Money update will begin on July 13.
Cowboys can embark on a new mission type called Crimes, which can be completed solo or as part of a Posse. Sometimes, you might be stopping a coach and robbing the passengers, and other missions are a multi-stage robbery with debt collecting, kidnapping, and other unsavory methods. This is all done in pursuit of a new kind of currency called Capitale, which has been stolen and distributed among the common low lives of the West. Players can earn Capitale through Crimes, or find innocent people with Capitale in free roam, at which point you can rob them and take that sweet, sweet currency.
The second new mission type is called Opportunities. Once a player accumulates enough Capitale, underworld contact Guido Martelli will send you out into the world to rob, undermine, and kneecap a rising politician. The first Opportunities will launch with Blood Money on July 13; more will come in future.
Blood Money will come with a new variation on the game’s season pass called the Quick Draw Club, which divides the usual structure up into four shorter tracks. Pamphlets previously available through the season pass that offer in-game benefits will be placed on sale at the Fence, so they can be acquired much more easily. 
Finally, on July 13 both Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption 2 will offer Nvidia DLSS support for anyone on PC with eligible Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards. That’s a nice way to upgrade an already beautiful game, and re-explore the story campaign or take a look at Online’s new content.]]></summary>

Akshan has arrived
 Akshan is League of Legends’ newest champion, and he can do something no one else in the game can: bring allies back from the dead. The new champion is part of the Sentinels of Light event, Riot Games’ first multigame event. 
Akshan is a ranged champion with a grappling hook, but the most interesting part of his kit is the passive on his W. When an enemy champion kills one of Akshan’s allies, that enemy gets marked as a Scoundrel. Akshan gets special bonuses against Scoundrels while they’re alive, but if he kills one, whoever the Scoundrel killed is immediately revived at their fountain.


This is the first time Riot has introduced this kind of death-defying ability to League of Legends, changing one of the game’s most fundamental mechanics, w…]]></summary>

The enigmatic defenseman has shown flashes of brilliance pulled back down to Earth by equaled bouts of inconsistency. 
 Our look at feasible targets for the Seattle Kraken in this month’s expansion draft began with James van Riemsdyk, and today we’ll continue by looking into a slightly less costly option for the NHL’s newest club.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Listen before we get to anything else we need to address this alternate logo the Flyers explored in the 90s. [BarDown]
*Anyhoo, tonight is another ‘this might be the end’ game, Game 5 down in Tampa. The Habs were up against it Monday and they got it done. Why not again? [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*We’re all (rightfully) focused on how Chuck is going to improve the team at the top this summer, but what about bringing a little more to the bottom too? [BSH]
*Charlie dives deep on James van Riemsdyk, who many have pegged as the guy Seattle will take in the upcoming draft. [The Athletic]
*Most of those draft-prediction articles came before the Dave Hakstol hire, though. What if Dave steers the Kraken toward taking one of our defensemen instead? [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of defensemen, the league buyout window opens soon and a couple of guys are eligible. Would the Flyers buy anyone out though? It’d be a weird move. [BSH]
*Next up on the Community Draft Board: a Swede with a cool name. [BSH]
*The Flyers might have a bit more competition in the defense market than we expected. [The Hockey News]
*This is pretty neat; a tiny Danish town has produced FIVE NHLers and someone decided to make a movie about it. [ProHockeyTalk]
*A couple of teams have signed players to league-max eight-year contracts in the last couple of weeks, so it’s worth looking at whether that’s a good idea or not. [TSN]
*And finally, if you’re into stats and science and maths and such, the fine folks at Hockey Graphs continue to do really interesting work on the myriad parts of NHL hockey. [Hockey Graphs]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is working to allow smaller meetings to take place in its Together Mode, which uses artificial intelligence to put multiple users in the same virtual space.





Launched last year during the peak of the global health crisis, Together Mode for meetings uses AI to place everyone on a call in a shared room-like environment, like a coffee shop or an auditorium, rather than the patchwork gallery view that typically comprises large Teams meetings. 



The idea behind the feature is to better replicate real face-to-face meetings by taking people out of their home environments and custom backgrounds, thereby making it easier to pick up on facial expressions, body language, and other non-verbal cues.



Together Mode can accommodate up to 49 people at a time, and currently only becomes available when at least five people have joined the meeting. Soon, however, Microsoft is making it so that the feature can be used with just two people.




Love the fact I can use together mode in #MicrosoftTeams with only two people when I'm on the developer preview 😍
I'm almost never in meetings with 5 or more people🙄 
Great change 🌠 pic.twitter.com/86bAitGBTW

Support for smaller gatherings in Together Mode is currently limited to the developer Beta preview, but will soon be available for all. If you want to try accessing the preview, click the ellipsis next to your profile picture, select About, then tick Developer Preview. If the option doesn't appear, it may be because of the way your work account is set up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has expanded several iPadOS 14 Apple Pencil features to additional languages, improving ‌Apple Pencil‌ functionality for those who write in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.





According to Apple's iOS and iPadOS Feature Availability page, these languages can now be used when copying handwriting as text and there's also data detector support.



That means if you write something in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, you can now copy the handwritten text and paste it as standard typed text, and addresses and other content written in these languages will also show up as interactive and clickable.





Both Copy Handwriting as Text and Data Detectors were already available for the English and Chinese languages, but have expanded much more broadly. Various dialects are supported including French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (Switzerland), French (France), German (Austria), German (Germany), German (Switzerland), Italian (Switzerland), Italian (Italy), Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), and Spanish (Mexico).



Apple earlier this year introduced Apple Pencil Scribble support for these same languages, allowing German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese speakers to write in their native language across iPadOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reese Witherspoon-owned media company Hello Sunshine is considering a sale, and Apple is one of the interested parties, reports The Wall Street Journal.





Apple already works with Hello Sunshine on popular Apple TV+ series "The Morning Show," which stars Witherspoon. Hello Sunshine is also involved in several upcoming ‌Apple TV+‌ shows like "Surface" starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, "The Last Thing He Told Me" with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series "My Kind of Country."



Hello Sunshine reportedly began pursuing a sale in the last couple of months and has received interest from multiple suitors, one of which is Apple. The company could be valued at as much as $1 billion, due to hits like the aforementioned series "The Morning Show" and also "Big Little Lies" and "Little Fires Everywhere."



The production company is working with investment bankers to explore its options, and there is no guarantee that it will be sold, nor that Apple will purchase it.



If Apple does indeed purchase Hello Sunshine, it could ultimately be folded into Apple Studios, Apple's own production company that is involved with some of its ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. Apple Studios is thus far working on "Surface," "Snow Blind" with Jake Gyllenhaal, "Emancipation" with Will Smith, and "Killers of the Flower Moon" with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple has added a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera's viewfinder or in a photo you've taken and let you perform several actions with it.





For example, if you take a picture of a storefront that displays a phone number, you can capture that number to place a call or add to your contacts. You can also copy Live Text from your photos for making use of elsewhere. It's an incredibly simple, useful feature, and here's how it works in its simplest form.




Launch the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad.


Find a photo that has some words on show, such as a restaurant menu or product tag.


Pinch to zoom the photo if the text appears small.


Press and hold on the words, then drag the ends of the selection tool to highlight all the text that you want to copy.


Take your finger off the screen, then select Copy from the contextual popup menu.


Finally, switch to an app that supports text input, press and hold your finger where the cursor is located, then select Paste from the popup menu.




Did you know that Live Text also features optical character recognition? That means if you have a picture of a handwritten note in your photos, you can still copy it and then paste it as digital text.



Live Photos also works with the camera app and other images on the ‌iPhone‌, plus there are other features in addition to copy/paste including Look Up and Translate, so you can translate foreign language text found in a photo. Live Text works with the Spotlight search on the ‌iPhone‌ as well, which lets text in photos be located through a standard ‌iPhone‌ search.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The galaxy is wild. Our solar system, with its surprising abundance of living creatures and nonstop radiation and asteroid showers, is a placid, private garden compared to the rest of it. 
In particular, there are perhaps trillions of rogue planets (planetary bodies ranging from little rocky Earth-sized guys to super-Jupiter gas giants) in the Milky Way, including a surprisingly large fleet of the things right near the galactic core.
This is unusual, since the typical way we detect exoplanets is by marking their repeated procession across a star. But rogue planets, by definition, don’t orbit stars. So the way astronomers find them is a little different, requiring use of gravitational microlensing.
Gizmodo breaks it down:
Data gathered by NASA’s now-retired Kepler Space Telescope has revealed a small population of free-floating planets near the Galactic Bulge. The new finding raises hope that a pair of upcoming missions will result in further detections of unbound planets, which drift through space separated from their home stars….
It’s impossible to know what the conditions are like on these presumed rogue exoplanets, but [astronomer Iain] McDonald said they could be “cold, icy wastelands,” and, if similar in size to Earth, their surfaces would “closely resemble bodies in the outer Solar System, like Pluto.”
The new paper suggests the presence of a large population of Earth-sized rogue planets in the Milky Way. It’s becoming clear that free-floating planets are common. McDonald said his team is currently working to come up with a more precise estimate for how many of them might exist.


Did you catch that part about how McDonald’s team made this discovery using a now-retired telescope? Yeah. Apparently the new telescope projects coming online are both more powerful and (in particular) better equipped to detect gravitational lensing effects, and therefore more likely to detect rogue planets in the future.

        <updated>2021-07-06T20:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fermi’s paradox is fairly well known: given what we know about the chance of intelligent life appearing somewhere in the universe, why haven’t any other species to date so far made contact with humanity? You can formalize the paradox via the Drake equation or some other method, but that’s the crux of it.
What’s less clear is how Enrico Fermi originally phrased the paradox. At Language Log, Mark Lieberman points out that each of the participants in the original conversation remembers it differently:
At lunch, Fermi suddenly exclaimed, “Where are they?” (Teller’s remembrance), or “Don’t you ever wonder where everybody is?” (York’s remembrance), or “But where is everybody?” (Konopinski’s remembrance).
As Liberman writes, “our memory of exact word sequences usually fades more quickly than our memory of (contextually interpreted) meanings. More broadly, the exact auditory sensations normally fade very quickly; the corresponding word sequences fade a bit more slowly; and the interpreted meanings last longest.” 
My own favorite (for purely aesthetic reasons) is “where is everybody?” It just kind of says everything you want such an observation to say.

A one-stop-shopping approach to mod downloading means creators lose some control of their work
 Nexus Mods is an A-list name among PC gamers, serving a McDonald’s-like 4.5 billion downloads of user-created content, changes, and improvements. The site is vital to a vibrant PC gaming culture whose players take pride in understanding how games are developed, and use that knowledge to tailor global bestselling franchises like The Witcher and The Elder Scrolls to their simplest taste. From the silly to the sublime, Nexus Mods has changed games for almost 20 years.

Eliksni Hatchling lets Guardians live their Destiny Sim dreams
 Destiny 2’s Fallen babies took the world by storm early this summer when the studio launched Season of the Splicer. The adorable refugees have been living in the Tower for some time, but thanks to a new emote, players can finally Rafiki their way into the lives of the four-eyed infants. 
Thanks to Destiny 2’s new Solstice of Heroes update, Guardians can finally get their hands on a Fallen baby of their own. The emote is called Eliksni Hatchling, and it’s exactly what you want. Players manifest a holographic Fallen baby into their hands and lift it into the sky, just like the opening of the Lion King when Rafiki shows Simba off to the Pride Lands.

      The Eliksni baby blinks and gets very excited once you lift it
  
The emote’s name, Eliksni Hatchling, uses the term “Eliksni” instead of “Fallen.” In the world of Destiny, Eliksni is the proper name for the Fallen race, and what they choose to call themselves. The Eliksni Quarter — where most of the Fallen babies are hanging out during Season of the Splicer — uses the same term. The term Fallen has always been a “nickname” for the “evil” Eliksni, and the Eliksni that are currently in the Last City seem to view it as a pejorative term.
The Eliksni Hatchling emote will run players 1,000 Silver — a common price for an Exotic emote. Players can purchase 1,100 Silver via Steam or other platform stores for $9.99. Today  In Destiny — a website that can tell players when Eververse items will go on sale for the earnable Bright Dust currency — doesn’t show the Eliksni Hatchling emote showing up for anything other than Silver for the rest of the season. However, the schedule does have some classified items on it, so the emote could show up for Bright Dust later on in the season.]]></summary>

Publisher Nacon pegs RoboCop: Rogue City for 2023 release
 A new RoboCop video game is in development and slated for release in 2023, publisher Nacon announced Tuesday during a livestream called Nacon Connect. Titled RoboCop: Rogue City, the first-person shooter will put players in the total body prosthesis of Alex Murphy, aka RoboCop, on a mission to protect Detroit.
Beyond that, Nacon and developer Teyon didn’t reveal much about RoboCop: Rogue City, other than that it’s destined for PC and unspecified consoles in a couple years. Rogue City will feature an original story in the franchise’s universe, Nacon said in a news release. The publisher and developer are working with studio MGM to “develop an authentic RoboCop game experience that is faithful to the franchise’s DNA,” Nacon said.
Teyon certainly has experience bringing ’80s action heroes to video games. The Polish studio is perhaps best known for its work on Terminator: Resistance, the 2019 shooter based on the Terminator franchise that wasn’t the worst thing ever, and Rambo: The Video Game, a 2014 rail shooter that was, frankly, pretty awful. A teaser trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City hints at something similarly low budget and perhaps a bit janky, but still shows promise.
RoboCop’s had a rough go of it in the video game space. Outside of the movie-to-arcade adaptation created by Data East in 1988, Murphy’s mostly starred in mediocre console games and free-to-play mobile fare (and one Mortal Kombat game) over the past few decades. Here’s hoping that Nacon (formerly known as Bigben Interactive) and Teyon will turn things around for ol’ Robo for his next adventure.
As for RoboCop’s next cinematic adventure, a planned direct sequel was in the works with director Neill Blomkamp, who left the project shortly after it was announced.]]></summary>

The FTC will be able to decide on the size and the scope of the order, so it is not yet clear how Apple might be impacted.

How to level your armor up in 2021
 Destiny 2’s fourth annual Solstice of Heroes event is here, and it brings a grind similar to the last several years from July 6 – Aug. 3, 2021. Players begin with a “Renewed” armor set and get the task of leveling up to a “Majestic” armor set and eventually a “Magnificent” armor set. 
During this Solstice of Heroes, players can make their Magnificent armor glow without purchasing special items from the in-game Eververse store — a white glow, just like last year. However, players who do purchase the Eververse glows will get Universal Ornaments — meaning it’s a look players can apply to any armor piece — that glows depending on their current subclass. This includes the new Stasis subclass from last year’s Beyond Light expansion.

Today’s vibe: scrapped WWDC 2014 intro film feat. Larry David, JB
Smoove, and Evan Spiegel.
What a find. It’s effectively a 10-minute mini-episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David as Apple’s head of app review for the App Store. Henri-Gold posted a 53-second clip to Twitter, but wrote:
The whole thing exists out there. I’m holding off on sharing the
link to protect the party who inadvertently released it; I don’t
want to cause any harm to their business over this. I encourage
you to not publicly share the link either. Thanks for
understanding.
A little late for that — the full version that was posted to Vimeo was pulled overnight. The whole video is funny in exactly the way Curb is funny, but Curb Your Enthusiasm-style humor is not Apple-style humor — and the difference has only widened since 2014. I don’t know how this project got so far, but the humor is such that I don’t see how Apple could possibly have used it, even in 2014. One joke that might have played as funny in 2014 but wouldn’t in 2021 is the central conceit of the video — that Apple’s head of app review is a capricious jerk who makes approval decisions based on inscrutable whims.

Another speedy winger enters the mix. 
 July is here and we’re inching closer and closer to the draft, and as we do, our draft board marches on. Next up, we’re closing out the top-20 and talking about Swedish winger Oskar Olausson. 
Olausson spent this season jumping around between levels in Sweden, but wherever he was placed, he seemed to find success. He’s a quick, skilled winger with a dynamic offensive game, and there’s a whole lot to like about his skillset. Let’s get into it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kensington today unveiled its new StudioCaddy, a modular, multi-device charger that works with iPhones, AirPods, iPads, and Macs. The StudioCaddy is aimed at households that have multiple Apple products and want a single convenient place to keep them organized and charged up.






Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


Design wise, the StudioCaddy is uncomplicated, with a streamlined look that fits in well with any decor. It's made from materials like plastic, aluminum, and a stitched fabric, and it feels like it has a durable build quality. The different pieces of the dock connect magnetically together.



There's a Qi-based charging station for the iPhone and the ‌AirPods‌, featuring a vertical Qi wireless charging spot for the ‌iPhone‌ and a flat spot for the ‌AirPods‌ or AirPods Pro. Since this is just Qi, either of these spots can also be used for other devices too. For iOS devices, charging maxes out at 7.5W, but 10W charging is available for Android devices.



At the side, there's a USB-C and and a USB-A port for charging additional devices, and you can use these with the laptop and tablet stand of the StudioCaddy. A MacBook or an iPad can fit into one of the StudioCaddy's storage slots, charging through the attached cables, which are sold separately.



The tablet/laptop stand works with any size MacBook, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is convenient if you need an overnight storage spot. You can leave the StudioCaddy's pieces attached together magnetically or separate them out across your desk for a custom setup.



Kensington is charging $179 for the StudioCaddy, which is expensive, but it is a solid multi-device charging station for those who need an all-in-one solution. More information is available on the Kensington website.

 Whenever a situation arises where both a player and team are dissatisfied with how events have progressed, it is usually best for a change of scenery. In such situations, a window of opportunity opens up for other teams to provide a chance to said player to re-write themselves.
With Warren Foegele, he appears to be headed in that direction.
In the “31 Thoughts” blog, Elliotte Friedman reported that there are trade discussions being had over Foegele, with both player and team wanting “a change”. Similar sounding rumors have arisen with the Flyers regarding Nolan Patrick, and though there’s no guarantee either player gets moved, once the news that both player and team want a change is public, it almost becomes…]]></summary>

UFC 4, The Medium, and Tropico 6 are on the way, too
 Microsoft has announced six more games coming to Xbox Game Pass in July 2021: Dragon Quest Builders 2, Tropico 6, EA Sports UFC 4, Bloodroots, The Medium, and Farming Simulator 9. These game will roll out on different platforms across July.
Here’s the full breakdown from the Xbox Wire:
Dragon Quest Builders 2 (cloud) — July 8
Tropico 6 (cloud, console, and PC) — July 8
UFC 4 (console via EA Play) — July 8
Bloodroots (cloud, console, and PC) — July 15
Farming Simulator 19 (cloud, console, and PC) — July 15
The Medium (cloud) — July 15
Last month, Microsoft added a whole bunch of games, including Gang Beasts and Limbo. As always, games must leave Xbox Game Pass when new comes are welcomed. This month, EA Sports UFC and EA Sports UFC 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass via EA Play on July 14, while Endless Space, Downwell, and CrossCode will depart on July 15.
Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service from Microsoft — and a dang good deal. There are plenty of games available for the subscription price, with more added every month. In June, Microsoft said it’ll bring “at least one new, first-party game into Game Pass” in each quarter of the year. Xbox Game Pass is $1 a month for the first three months; after that, it costs $9.99 a month on either PC or consoles, whereas the Ultimate tier, which includes both, goes for $14.99 per month.
Subscribers that have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also have access to Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming platform, which is now available on Apple devices and Windows PC via browsers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook is attending the Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho this week alongside many high-profile guests, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to NPR. Described as a "summer camp for billionaires," the annual media conference is hosted by private investment firm Allen & Company and allows media and tech moguls to negotiate deals in between leisure activities such as golfing and whitewater rafting.




Apple CEO Tim Cook at a previous Sun Valley Conference


Variety previously revealed the guest list for this year's conference. In addition to Cook and Zuckerberg, notable invitees included billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone, "Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, Dell CEO Michael Dell, and others. However, the report noted that not everyone on the guest list chooses to attend.



After being canceled last year due to the pandemic, the Sun Valley Conference returns this year with health and safety measures in place, with attendees required to present a negative PCR test result obtained within 72 hours prior to arrival, according to Vanity Fair. The report added that many presentations and events will take place outdoors.



Cook has attended the Sun Valley Conference multiple times, often alongside Apple's services chief Eddy Cue. While details are typically kept under wraps, it was recently reported that during a private meeting at the conference in 2019, Cook urged Zuckerberg to delete all user information Facebook had collected from third-party apps.



With so many media executives gathering in one place, the Sun Valley Conference likely provides Cook with an opportunity to negotiate Apple TV+ content deals. Should any details emerge from this year's conference, we will share them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've installed the public beta of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey on any of your devices, you may have already tried out some of the new features Apple has added to the Notes app, such as the ability to use @ user mentions in shared notes and the long-desired support for tags. 





However, some users have discovered that notes containing instances of these two new features don't show up in some earlier versions of iOS and macOS, so it's best just to stay away from them if you have any other devices still running older versions of Apple's desktop or mobile operating systems.



As reported by 9to5Mac, if the Notes app identifies a device in your iCloud account running a version earlier than iOS 14.5 or macOS 11.3, it will alert you to the fact that tagged notes or notes containing mentions will be hidden on those devices. 



On the plus side, if your other devices are fully up-to-date and running iOS 14.5 or macOS Big Sur 11.3 or later, then it appears that any notes using @ mentions or tags are able to be opened by those versions.



As always with beta software, it's inadvisable to install these version on devices that you rely on for work or anything else important, especially if you're using multiple devices on the same Apple account, this example being a case in point.

Pegatron has obtained orders for the upcoming 5.4-inch iPhone model, as well as a portion of orders for another upcoming ‌iPhone‌ model that will feature a 6.1-inch display, according to market sources.
This year's ‌iPhone 13‌ mini is expected to be the last 5.4-inch model that Apple will offer in its flagship lineup, owing to poor sales, according to reliable sources. Apple does not plan to introduce a 5.4-inch ‌iPhone‌ 14 mini, with the mini line ending after the ‌iPhone 13‌.

 It’s not that modern historians of the medieval Mediterranean, Europe and Africa have been ignorant about contacts between Ethiopia and Europe; the issue was that they had the power dynamic reversed. The traditional narrative stressed Ethiopia as weak and in trouble in the face of aggression from external forces, especially the Mamluks in Egypt, so Ethiopia sought military assistance from their fellow Christians to the north—th…]]></summary>

50 years ago today, Louis Armstrong made his final reel-to-reel tape. After concluding it with “April in Paris” from the “Ella and Louis” album, he went to sleep and passed away. This video contains the final minute of “April in Paris,” directly transferred from that last tape. pic.twitter.com/9zq9jWtiPj

For a variety of reasons, I recently found myself inside a legal marijuana dispensary for the first time. I wasn’t sure exactly what I expected the retail experience to be like — a liquor store? a coffee shop? a used car lot? the paraphrenelia shops I first checked out as a teenager? — but I was nevertheless surprised. 
The closest analogy I can think of is a jewelry store. There was pretty decent security, including a whole separate room for customers to check in, and everything was presented in a secure display case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patience Haggin, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
After the tracking change took effect in April, many users of Apple’s iOS operating system have received a high volume of prompts from apps asking permission to track them—requests that most have declined. Less than 33% of iOS users opt in to tracking, according to ad-measurement firm Branch Metrics Inc.
As a result, the prices for mobile ads directed at iOS users have fallen, while ad prices have risen for advertisers seeking to target Android users. […]
Digital-ad agency Tinuiti Inc. has seen a similar pattern in its clients’ spending, research director Andy Taylor said. When iOS users opted out of tracking, Tinuiti advertisers couldn’t bid on them, he said. That dearth of iOS users drove up demand—and ad prices—for Android users. About 72.8% of smartphones world-wide use the Android operating system, and about 26.4% use iOS, according to Statcounter.
Tinuiti’s Facebook clients went from year-over-year spend growth of 46% for Android users in May to 64% in June. The clients’ iOS spending saw a corresponding slowdown, from 42% growth in May to 25% in June. Android ad prices are now about 30% higher than ad prices for iOS users, Mr. Taylor said.
If any part of this is surprising, it’s the claim that as many as one-third of iOS users have opted in to tracking.

Can a wireless gaming mouse be good for esports?
 I use to equate the quality of esports mice with garish looks, bulky construction, and fancy button configurations. However, my favorite mouse of the last few years, the Logitech G Pro Wireless, is the exact opposite of that aesthetic. It’s simple and understated. It feels so light, you would be excused for thinking it was just a regular office mouse. But the technology packed inside its tiny frame makes it fast, accurate, and effortless to use.
This is why we think that the Logitech G Pro Wireless one of the best esports and FPS gaming mice out there.

In the second edition of his new Power On newsletter for Bloomberg, Gurman suggests that Apple is prepared to jettison its tradition of attracting technologists to Cupertino in favor of opening offices in places where operation costs are less high and living costs aren't as prohibitive for its employees.



The company is said to be "losing talent" because employees are struggling to afford the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, despite being high earners by most standards. Anecdotally, many engineers who have spoken to Gurman have complained tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular open-source audio editing software Audacity is facing "spyware" allegations from users for recent privacy policy changes that suggest the desktop app is collecting user data and sharing it with third parties, including state regulators where applicable.



Two months ago, Audacity was acquired by Muse Group, which owns other audio-related projects including the Ultimate Guitar website and the MuseScore app. According to Fosspost, changes to the privacy policy section on the Audacity website indicate that several personal data collection mechanisms have since been added by the parent company.



The type of data collected now includes the computer's processor, operating system and version, the user's IP address, and any crash reports, fatal error codes and messages generated by their machine. More concerning perhaps is the inclusion of a vague section listing data that must be collected "for legal enforcement, litigation, and authorities' requests (if any)."



The storage of said data is located in servers in the U.S., Russia, and the European Economic Area. For example, IP addresses are stored in an identifiable way for a day before being hashed and then stored in servers for a year, leaving users identifiable via government data requests.



In addition, the new policy prevents people under the age of 13 from using the software, which is a violation of the GPL license that Audacity uses. 



Understandably, the policy changes have upset Audacity users, who have taken to Reddit and GitHub to question why an offline desktop app needs to "phone home" at all, and there is already discussion about forking Audacity into a separate open-source project that's free from the Muse Group's ownership and questionable data collection practices.

Introduced in iOS 14.5, Apple's App Tracking Transparency rules require apps that access an iPhone's ad identifier or IDFA must ask a user's permission before tracking is allowed. As reported by the Financial Times in March, however, the change spurred ad and tech groups in China to develop a new way of tracking users without their consent, called CAID.

Pick up three weapons and an armor pieces
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: The Dead Cliffs
3 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock gloves)
7 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Energy, submachine gun
Flawless — Sola’s Scar (Adept), Kinetic pulse rifle — random Adept mod
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

After two-plus years of support, MK11 is complete
 NetherRealm Studios, the company behind the Mortal Kombat series, is moving on to a new game — and won’t be producing any more Mortal Kombat 11 content, the company announced Friday.
The studio is “now focusing on its next project” after supporting Mortal Kombat 11 for more than two years, it said in a tweet on the Mortal Kombat account. “DLC for the game, including characters, has come to an end,” NetherRealm said. 
NetherRealm is now focusing on its next project and after more than two years of supporting Mortal Kombat 11, DLC for the game, including characters, has come to an end.
— Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate (@MortalKombat) July 2, 2021



Mortal Kombat 11 debuted in April 2019 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Over time, NetherRealm expanded upon the game with multiple DLC packs that added content such as stages and characters. The November 2020 release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, which collected all the DLC into one package, boasted a total of 13 additional fighters — increasing the original roster by more than 50%. 
Discontinuing DLC means that there won’t be any major changes coming to the game. Fighting games like Mortal Kombat 11 often rely on consistent updates to help improve the experience by balancing characters and adding new ones. It’s a huge part of keeping fans interested, and invested in the game. 
NetherRealm did not provide any hints as to what the company’s next project will be.]]></summary>

More defense!
 We knew this going in. One of the difficulties in evaluating some of this year’s draft prospects was going to come in the fact that many of them have played very little (and some not at all), and this is the case we’re running into with our next player. 
Corson Ceulemans played just eight games with the Brooks Bandits before the AJHL shut down, and his season ended. That season was limited to those eight games, plus a six game run for Canada at the U18s, but brief as it may have been, it was still a very solid season for Ceulemans. Let’s get into it!

But America’s pandemic preparedness still has major gaps, some of which are too big for any one administration to fix. In recent weeks, I’ve called back many of the experts I interviewed over the past 18 months about masks, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and more. I asked them, “Are we ready for another one?” The short answer is “Not quite.” The long answer is that being truly “ready” will be harder than anyone realizes.


The Trump administration mishandled the American response to Covid-19 so completely that it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon believes that Qualcomm will provide laptop chips that can compete with Apple silicon by next year and has explained how the company views Apple's expected transition to its own custom modems.





Speaking to Reuters, Amon said that Qualcomm is capable of having the best chip on the market, thanks to a team of chip architects who previously worked for Apple but have since come to Qualcomm.



Earlier this year, Qualcomm acquired the chip startup company Nuvia for $1.4 billion, which was founded by a number of Apple chip designers. Qualcomm will begin selling custom silicon Nuvia-based laptop chips in 2022, which are expected to boast impressive power consumption for extended battery life.

TFT Reckoning: Dawn of Heroes lets players choose a single, ultra-powerful Radiant item 
 Shadow Items will disappear in Teamfight Tactics: Reckoning’s mid-set update, Dawn of Heroes. In lieu of the Shadow Items that players have been using for the past few months, Dawn of Heroes will introduce a feature called Radiant Items, Riot announced in a blog post on Friday.
Shadow Items were powerful tools that also came with major drawbacks. By powering up one member, you might weaken others nearby, or something similar. Radiant Items do not have these drawbacks, and only offer powerful boons for players and their units. But unlike Shadow Items, players will only get one Radiant Item each game. 
In round 3-6 of Dawn of Heroes — which replaces the 3-2 Armory round, where…]]></summary>

 Riot Games’ latest music project is an album of chill lo-fi beats for players to relax/game to. The League of Legends and Valorant developer announced and released the new project on Friday, along with a YouTube animated video that spans the entire album and fits right in to the lo-fi genre. 
The album is called Sessions: Vi, named after the League of Legends champion that stars in the video and that the music is themed after. 
In an interview with Polygon, Toa Dunn, head of Riot Music, explained the album and animation’s loose story. It starts out with music to help Vi decompress and relax as soon as she gets from from work. Then it transitions to music she can work to, while she’s doing a proj…]]></summary>

More to come at QuakeCon
 Doom Eternal’s multiplayer Invasion Mode, which would have let players invade other players’ campaigns as demons, has been shelved, according to an update from id Software executive producer Marty Stratton. Instead, id is focusing its efforts on a new single-player Horde Mode for Doom Eternal and a “refresh” of Battlemode, the 2v1 multiplayer experience that pits two player-controlled demons against the Doomslayer.
Stratton said that remote work as a result of the pandemic slowed development of Invasion Mode. Other factors, including how already released updates for Doom Eternal resonated with players, influenced the decision to put Invasion Mode on the back burner.
From Stratton’s development update, posted Friday on the Bethseda Softw…]]></summary>

Apple usually only releases the public betas of ‌iOS and ‌iPadOS‌ once the developer versions are relatively stable. That said, Apple's beta versions of its major software updates can be notoriously buggy, especially the early releases.



You may find apps not working properly, poor battery life, device crashes, and features that don't do what they're supposed to. Fortunately, you can restore your iPhone or iPad to the previous version of iOS.



If you made an archived backup before you installed the beta, you can remove the ‌‌iOS 15‌ beta …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple and Amazon are facing antitrust disciplinary proceedings in Spain for possible restrictive competition practices around the sale of Apple products, it has emerged.





In a press release, the country's National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) said it had initiated the proceedings against both companies for "possible anti-competition practices in the sectors of Internet sales of electronic products and the provision of marketing services to third-party retailers through online platforms."



The independent consumer interest body said it had access to "certain information" from which it had found "rational indications" that Amazon and Apple are in breach of laws related to the defense of competition and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Specifically:

The possible unlawful conduct would consist of an agreement between both groups that would include possible restrictions on the Amazon website in Spain regarding:



(i) The retail sale of APPLE products by third parties;

(ii) Certain advertising of competing Apple products and certain campaigns directed at Apple customers by Amazon;

(iii) Other commercial restrictions.
The CNMC announcement does not prejudge the final result of the investigation, which will occur over a maximum period of 18 months before a final resolution is made.

        <updated>2021-07-02T08:59:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter is considering letting users post select tweets for "Trusted Friends" only. That's the name of a feature the social media platform is testing that would allow users to limit the audience for specific content to a smaller circle of people.





Based on design concepts shared by the company (via TechCrunch), Trusted Friends could be a toggle that lets you indicate whether a tweet should be made public or be shown to just a handful of users. The idea is similar to Instagram's "Close Friends" feature, which lets users share personal Stories more privately. 



Bringing the option to Twitter would allow users who have multiple Twitter accounts separating their personal and professional lives to tweet from a single account and have greater control of who sees what on their timeline. It could also mean some users no longer have to toggle between public and protected tweets.



Twitter recently announced new ways for creators and influencers to deliver content to specific users who pay to access its "Super Follow" feature, and Trusted Friends feels like an experimental extension of the idea that would be available to all users. But it's just a concept for now, and there's no guarantee Twitter will ever take it live.



Other concepts Twitter says it is looking into include "Facets," which would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all a user's tweets, or only those about the "facet" they're interested in, and an ability for users to list specific phrases that they don't want to see in replies. 



As with Trusted Friends, neither of these features are currently in active development and Twitter is simply seeking feedback to gauge whether they're worth pursuing or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 127 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for CSS, Scrolling, JavaScript, Media, WebRTC, WebAPI, Accessibility, and Rendering.



The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.



Live Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an M1 Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.



Other updates include WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.



The new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both macOS Big Sur and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.



The ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website.



Apple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

The good news is, for all the recent fears among Mac users that
Apple might be attempting to collapse Mac, iPhone, and iPad into a
single amorphous product, macOS Monterey still feels unreservedly
like a Mac. Apple wants its platforms to share features, but it
also recognizes that each serves a different (albeit overlapping)

Worth pointing out again that Shortcuts for Mac is not a Catalyst app. In fact, there are no new Catalyst apps from Apple in MacOS 12. It’s seemed clear to me all along that Catalyst was a transitional framework a…]]></summary>

As I said earlier this week, I’ve been slowly working my way through James Payne’s Great Art Explained video series. But then — bang! — he came out with a new episode on Vincent van Gogh and his masterpiece, Starry Night. Having seen this painting in person for the first time in a few years just days ago at MoMA, I abandoned the back catalog and dug in to this new one immediately.
Van Gogh is one of my favorites — I spent several happy hours at his museum in Amsterdam in 2017 — and Payne does a good job of contextualizing his life and work around the time he painted Starry Night, particularly the emphasis on the influence of Japanese art on his work and his probable incorporation of spiral galaxy imagery into Starry Night. Highly recommended, especially if you’ve seen the painting in person.

The god of mischief is coming to Fortnite Crew
 Loki, the self-proclaimed god of mischief, will be bringing his tricks and pranks to Fortnite. Marvel’s anti-hero is the headliner for July 2021 Crew Pack, which features his iconic green outfit — complete with cape and “back bling” — as well as his Scepter Pickaxe (“the glow stick of destiny”), the Chitauri Chariot Glider, and a new welcoming loading screen. 
Loki’s bundle is available through Fortnite Crew, Fortnite’s monthly subscription offering. A Crew subscription costs $11.99 a month; that includes 1,000 free V-bucks, the current season’s battle pass — which features Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty this time around — and whatever the current skin offering is each month.
Superhero cameos are nothing new in Fortnite. Thor, Iron Man, Wolverine, Storm, and others from the Marvel Comics universe showed up in the game last year, and of course, Thanos came to Fortnite back in 2018. Characters from the DC side of the superhero universes have also shown up; Batman entered Fortnite and got an entire miniseries, and Superman joined as a playable character as well. 
Loki’s Fortnite cameo comes on the heels of his big television series debut, which came to Disney Plus in June. That said, this Loki doesn’t seem to be based on Tom Hiddleston’s likeness; he looks a little slimmer, and a little more... shall we say, snakelike.]]></summary>

There are probably several deserving scenes omitted from the thread (no Wes Anderson fans…the sushi scene from Isle of Dogs?), but that Blade Runner shot is probably my favorite from the decade. I would also have included a shot from Dunkirk (one of the expansive plane chase vistas that looked incredible in IMAX) , Portrait of a Lady on Fire, and the final scene in Carol — that look gives me chills just writing about it.

You can dance if you want to. Everyone did.
 Driving around the streets of San Andreas in Grand Theft Auto Online is usually done at 140 mph, outracing flying motorcycles, and listening to sweet tunes on the radio. But on a GTA Online role-playing server, life is much more tranquil. People (mostly) obey traffic laws and stop to smell the roses. They even hold parades. On the New Day role-play server, the GTA community even banded together for an in-game Pride event.
“Myself as a player, I am a LGBT youth who is not as fortunate as others,” Peacheslatoure, the parade’s organizer, told Polygon over Discord. “I use roleplay as an outlet to express who I wish I could be to the public.”
On the New Day server, Peacheslatoure takes the role of Jeb Miller,…]]></summary>

Left 4 Dead 2 might still be the best game in the genre, even after all the new imitators 
 Nearly 12 years after the release of Left 4 Dead 2, the genre it popularized has crossed back into the spotlight. At E3 2021, and in the weeks after, studios and publishers have announced nearly half a dozen games inspired by Valve’s co-op shooter. But even after a decade of innovations that other developers could bring to the genre, its best version might still be Left 4 Dead 2 with a few minor upgrades. 
When Left 4 Dead 2 was first released, many fans bristled at the fact that it was coming just a year after the original game. Sure, it had new levels, the addition of melee weapons, better enemy AI, and more enemy types, but at a glance, it didn’t look much different…]]></summary>

Philadelphia does need a right-handed defenseman.
 It is probably the worst kept secret in the NHL that the Philadelphia Flyers are looking to add a defenseman before next season. After the untimely retirement of Matt Niskanen and no real replacement, the Flyers went through a spiraling series of unfortunate events that left no real defenseman capable of holding a top-pairing role.
With an unstable blue line — that might get even worse once the Seattle Kraken snatches someone away through the expansion draft — GM Chuck Fletcher is keeping his eye on any player that can make a pokecheck and preferably holds his stick on his right side.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is developing a hybrid work model for its retail employees that would sometimes allow them to work from home, reports Bloomberg.





It may sound unusual for a retail employee to work from home, but in this case, it means that workers would be able to take on at-home support shifts in addition to their in-store shifts.



A "Retail Flex" pilot program is set to debut, which will see at-home employees handling online sales, customer service, and technical support as Apple expects that many people will continue to prefer online shopping over in-person shopping.



Apple retail stores were closed for much of 2020 amid the ongoing health crisis, but all retail locations have now reopened and are operational. When the pilot program launches, workers will move between their store and remote roles depending on demand in stores vs. online shopping at different times during the year. Salaries will remain constant regardless of where an employee is working.



Participants in the Retail Flex program are being asked to participate for at least six months, with the initiative to ramp up from September to December when new devices are set to launch. Employees will be reimbursed for some internet expenses and will receive $100 to put toward office equipment.



For corporate employees, Apple is implementing a work schedule that will see them returning to the office for three days a week starting in September. Some employees petitioned Apple for a more remote friendly work environment that would allow them to work from home permanently, but Apple's retail and people lead Deirdre O'Brien clarified that Apple's in-person work schedule is non-negotiable as in-person work is "essential" to Apple product development and company culture.

Hey! You got your Agent in my Bounty Hunter!
 Star Wars: The Old Republic is turning ten, and a new expansion to the story-based MMO is on the way. On Thursday, BioWare announced a new expansion called Legacy of the Sith, which comes with tons of story and mechanical upgrades to the game. 
Players get to hunt down the renegade Sith Darth Malgus on the aquatic planet of Manaan. Malgus has been a threat in the game since the very beginning, and the conflict with him has been building throughout various quests and campaigns.
After Star Wars: The Old Republic’s launch in 2011, the story took a diversion into exploring a third faction, the Eternal Empire. More recent expansions have returned The Old Republic to the very familiar battleground of Empire versus Republic, and the conflict will continue as the sides battle over Manaan.


Legacy of the Sith will raise the level cap by 5, up to 80, and will also introduce a new Flash Point and Operations for players to tackle together. In addition, players can expect some big improvements to day-to-day play style. The character customization, class design, and itemization is all being streamlined and improved.
The most interesting addition is Combat Styles, which means “independently choosing a specific class story and combining it with ability sets from other related tech or Force-wielding classes.” In short, it’s less about picking one class and being restrained to specific abilities, and more about going with a tech or Force character, then mixing and matching components to build a playing style you enjoy.
Legacy of the Sith will arrive during the holiday season in 2021, and kick off The Old Republic’s 10th anniversary event, which runs throughout 2022.]]></summary>

According to Spotify, the beta software features compatibility improvements and optimizations for the Arm-based ‌M1‌ systems from Apple.



The beta software can be downloaded from Spotify's community site, and Spotify is seeking feedback on how the software runs. The company says that because this is a beta, there could be some unexpected behavior, and user feedback will be used to tweak and improve the usage experience.



Spotify users have been asking for a native version of the Spotify app for ‌M1‌ Macs since the machines first launched last year, so this will be welcome news for Spotify users who have an Apple silicon Mac.

Streams start July 8, EA Play Live gets underway July 22
 Electronic Arts’ midsummer showcase, EA Play Live, begins July 22, and it will be preceded by a livestream series called EA Play Spotlight, running from July 8 to July 20, the company announced Thursday. 
EA Sports figures prominently in the broadcast schedule, with shows on Monday, July 19, and Tuesday, July 20. Madden NFL 22 takes the Monday slot with a discussion of “How the Community Shaping Madden NFL 22.” The newest version of the game, launching at the end of August, will feature several improvements and systems changes in its Franchise mode, directly answering criticisms and requests from longtime players.
July 20’s broadcast is simply “More EA SPORTS!” according to Thursday’s announcement from Electronic Arts. The July 8 show is about “The Future of First-Person Shooters,” which likely includes a discussion of Battlefield 2042, announced three weeks ago as E3 2021 was getting underway.
And July 13’s showcase is focused to the EA Originals label, which publishes independent studios’ games, such as May’s Knockout City from Velan Studios, or Coldwood Interactive’s Unravel and Unravel Two.

All broadcasts, except for July 19’s, begin at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT. The Madden livestream is set for 7 p.m EDT/4 p.m. PDT.
EA Play Live begins at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT on July 22; a news release from EA said that the main show will be 40 minutes long and spotlight Battlefield 2042, Apex Legends, and Lost in Random, an EA Originals title from Zoink Games, which also made 2018’s Fe for Electronic Arts. Lost in Random was announced during E3 2019.]]></summary>

Apple is hosting limited sessions in Apple Stores this year, a departure from last year when Apple Camp transitioned to an in-home experience.





Apple Camp is open to children aged 8 to 12, but sessions are highly limited and generally only available in major cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York.



Right now, Apple is offering one session on the Clips app on iPad, which the company says will allow children to "make movie magic" with short videos. Signups are available on the Apple Camp section of the Today at Apple website.



Children who are not in an area where an Apple Camp session is being held can access a new at-home activity guide that's available to download. It offers a full calendar of activities like making a photo album of textures, creating a storybook starring toys, making a tourist map, making songs in GarageBand, and more.

Quria deserved more after 6 years
 Bungie concluded one of the major plots in Destiny 2: Season of the Splicer on Tuesday. Players dived into the Vex Network and killed Quria, one of Savathun’s most important pawns and the force behind the Endless Night in the Tower. 
Over the past year, Bungie has started intertwining Destiny 2’s gameplay and story, giving players a reason to care about upcoming events and plot twists. So the appearance of a major pawn like Quria ups the stakes. But Bungie’s story improvements reveal a new problem: The gameplay doesn’t live up to the story’s expectations.
Quria has been a known villain for years, but instead of going out in a major piece of content like a raid or dungeon, the mission to kill her is a remix of several Sea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[George Packer, writing for The Atlantic:
Rumsfeld was the worst secretary of defense in American history. Being newly dead shouldn’t spare him this distinction. He was worse than the closest contender, Robert McNamara, and that is not a competition to judge lightly. McNamara’s folly was that of a whole generation of Cold Warriors who believed that Indochina was a vital front in the struggle against communism. His growing realization that the Vietnam War was an unwinnable waste made him more insightful than some of his peers; his decision to keep this realization from the American public made him an unforgivable coward. But Rumsfeld was the chief advocate of every disaster in the years after September 11. Wherever the United States government contemplated a wrong turn, Rumsfeld was there first with his hard smile — squinting, mocking the cautious, shoving his country deeper into a hole. His fatal judgment was equaled only by his absolute self-assurance. He lacked the courage to doubt himself. He lacked the wisdom to change his mind.

Just dump your bricks out into a pile and the app will analyze what Lego bricks you have, what new creations you can build with them, and provide you with detailed build instructions. It can even guide you to find individual pieces in the pile. View a short demo — I’m assuming they’re using some sort of AI/machine learning to do this?
My kids have approximately a billion Legos at my house, so I downloaded Brickit to try it out. The process is a little slow and you need to do a little bit of pre-sorting (by taking out the big pieces and spreading your pile out evenly), but watching the app do its thing is kinda magical. When I have more time later, I’m definitely going to go back and try to build some of the ideas it found for me. (via @marcprecipice)

As always, there’s a new keyword with this expansion, and it’s Tradable. Tradable cards can be played normally, or you can put them back into your deck for one mana and draw another card that might work better. Of course, it might not; it’s a bit of a gamble.

 There’s a hell of an Easter egg crossover awaiting Sea of Thieves players at the end of the new expansion, A Pirate’s Life, which launched on June 22. In fact, it’s so good, pretty much even the slyest mention of its adjacent connection to A Pirate’s Life — a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise — would probably give it away. Therefore:

The European Aerial Zone is back in Destiny 2
 Solstice of Heroes, Destiny 2’s summer celebration event, will return this year on July 6. Bungie announced the holiday’s return in a post on its website. The event will run until Aug. 3, and players will be able to earn some new goodies to celebrate summer in the Last City. This comes after after the final Season of the Splicer mission, which Bungie launched on June 29. It’s notable that, in the screenshot above, the Tower is shown in the day time, whereas it has been mired in darkness since early May.
As usual, the Solstice of Heroes event revolves around acquiring and upgrading special armor sets. Players will get low-ranking armor at the start of the event and slowly improve it by performing various tasks throughout …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The popular smart lighting brand Philips Hue is planning to launch considerably brighter bulbs and expand its filament range later this year, according to hueblog.com.





Most Philips Hue lights can only reach a maximum brightness of 806 lumens, but the company is planning to launch new standard-size bulbs that offer up to 1,100 lumens of brightness.



Philips Hue is also planning to offer a larger lamp with up to 1,600 lumens in Hue White, Hue White Ambiance, and Hue White and Color Ambiance versions. The larger size of this bulb is necessitated by the need for additional passive cooling measures as the LED produces more heat when emitting more light.







In addition, Philips Hue is seeking to expand its filament range of bulbs by introducing new E27 filament shapes in the White Ambiance range, with a maximum brightness of 550 lumens. There will also be a brand new E14 Hue White filament bulb for the European market, which will become the smallest filament lamp in the range.





According to hueblog.com, the new products will be officially unveiled at the end of August or the beginning of September.



Elsewhere, the company is said to be exploring new Hue products with its Gradient lighting technology. This enables the output of several colors simultaneously and has so far only been available with its Gradient Lightstrip.

From the accompanying article of six takeaways from the investigation:
Most of the videos we analyzed were filmed by the rioters. By carefully listening to the unfiltered chatter within the crowd, we found a clear feedback loop between President Trump and his supporters.

He’ll be a freshman this fall at the University of Notre Dame, but this year he was well over a point per game in the USHL and with the US National Development Program. His playmaking not only produces assists, but it creates goals for himself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The popular software for virtualizing Windows on macOS, Parallels Desktop, has confirmed that support for the newly announced Windows 11 is in the works for Mac computers.





Last week, Microsoft unveiled Windows 11, the next major version of the Windows operating system. Obviously, Windows 11 won't be supported on Mac computers, but as is normal, some Mac users run virtualized desktops on their Mac with Windows.



As reported by iMore, Parallels has confirmed that it is waiting to dig into Windows 11, once all of its features, such as Teams integration and Android apps, are released and part of the Windows 11 Preview build before they starting working on Mac compatibility. As per the report:

"Since Windows 11 has just been announced recently, the Parallels Engineering team is waiting for the official Windows 11 Insider Preview build to start studying changes introduced in the new OS to deliver full compatibility in future Parallels Desktop updates," Nick Dobrovolskiy, SVP of Engineering and Support told iMore. Microsoft's first Insider preview build came out on Monday, but the rollout was a bumpy one and it doesn't include all of the new features that are coming to Windows 11 later this year such as Microsoft Teams integration or support for Android apps.
 No specifics were given, but Parallels did say that it "will surely do everything that's possible to make it happen." On Intel-based Mac computers, users can natively run Windows using Boot Camp, as well as through virtualization. However, running Windows natively through Boot Camp is no longer possible on all Apple silicon Macs, leaving virtualization to be the only option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chinese smartphone maker Oppo appears to be preparing "Oppo Card" as a rival to Apple Card, following similar moves by Apple competitors Google, Samsung, and Huawei.





According to Chinese trademark filings seen by DroidMaze, Oppo has filed to trademark "Oppo Card." The trademark is filed under international classifications, meaning that the company hopes to use the "Oppo Card" brand overseas.



Apple released the ‌Apple Card‌ in 2019 as a credit card that is linked to Apple Pay and built directly into the Wallet app. Apple is partnering with Goldman Sachs for the card, which is optimized for ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ but will still work like a traditional credit card for all of your transactions. ‌Apple Card‌ also offers a number of features such as Daily Cash, spending tracking, purchase notifications, an engraved titanium physical card, and more.



Following the launch of ‌Apple Card‌, leaked images showed that Google was developing its own physical and virtual debit card in partnership with banks in the United States, featuring the ability to add or remove funds from the card after connecting a bank account.





Last year, Samsung launched "Samsung Pay Card" in the captive market of the UK, where ‌Apple Card‌ is currently unavailable, with a comparable offering of cashback, instant spend notifications, and software integration. Huawei has also launched "Huawei Card," featuring a very similar model to ‌Apple Card‌ with a physical and virtual card, cashback, and other perks.



Given the increasing number of smart card options from major tech companies, it is likely that Oppo Card will seek to compete with cashback and software integrations, but little else is known about the  finance product at this early stage.

*Rumors, they abound. Some from reliable sources, some from random corners of the internet. Anyway, the Flyers really can’t include Joel Farabee in any kind of trade. [BSH]
*Speaking of rumors, LeBrun has a few. Including, perhaps, an actual offer sheet?! [The Athletic]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instagram will start hosting full-screen videos as part of a major shakeup of the social platform, as the Facebook-owned company seeks to make itself more relevant in an era dominated by TikTok and YouTube.





That's the major take-home from a video shared on Wednesday by Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram. In the video posted to his Instagram and Twitter account, Mosseri said that the social platform no longer wants to be thought of as the "square photo-sharing app," and will instead lean more into entertainment and video.



Instagram is no stranger to video content, previously offered through things like IGTV, Reels, and Stories, but Mosseri said Instagram would be "embracing video more broadly" going forward, starting with "full screen, immersive, entertaining, mobile-first video," which sounds a lot like TikTok, whose popularity Mosseri concedes is something Instagram wants to emulate.




Changes are coming to video on Instagram 📺
At Instagram we’re always trying to build new features that help you get the most out of your experience. Right now we’re focused on four key areas: Creators, Video, Shopping and Messaging. pic.twitter.com/ezFp4hfDpf
— Adam Mosseri 😷 (@mosseri) June 30, 2021
 


Instagram will also start testing recommendations over the next couple of months, showing users in their Feed what they may not be following yet. (The platform actually began testing in this department just this week, with the introduction of topics, which users can opt to see more or less of.)



Users should expect plenty of experimentation in this area "over the coming months," said Mosseri, and Instagram intends to be more public about what it's doing and why in the increasingly competitive social media space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Apple announced that it would be directing 100 percent of eligible proceeds from (PRODUCT)RED purchases to the Global Fund's COVID-19 Response to "provide critical support to health systems most threatened by the outbreak" in sub-Saharan Africa until June 30, 2021. Now, the company has extended the period until December 30, 2021.





Apple began its partnership with (RED) in 2006 with the end goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The partnership includes several different projects, including Apple-supported grants and more than $250 million in donations to the Global Fund's HIV/AIDS programs through Apple's PRODUCT (RED) purchases.



Apple offers a number of (PRODUCT)RED products, including devices and accessories such as the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, and (PRODUCT)RED Apple Watch Series 6. A number of cases, such as the company's leather and silicone MagSafe cases are also offered in (PRODUCT)RED. Until December 30, all eligible proceeds from these purchases will be directed to the Global Fund's COVID-19 response.



Continuing from its announcement last year, through December 7, Apple is also donating $1 for every purchase made with Apple Pay on apple.com, in the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store to the Global Fund's COVID-19 Response. More information on Apple's work with (RED) can be found on Apple's website alongside (PRODUCT)RED products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Professional road racing cyclist Lachlan Morton is attempting to complete the Tour de France this year. Except: He’s doing it entirely on his own, without teammates, support vehicles, and transportation from the previous day’s finish to the next day’s start (which might be dozens or even hundreds of miles apart). That means he’ll be riding an extra 1500 miles, climbing an additional 50,000 feet in elevation, shopping for his own meals, and still trying to beat the peloton to Paris. Here’s a quick explanatory trailer:

You can follow his progress on Rapha’s site and check out updates in this Instagram Story. He’s currently ahead of the peloton, even riding day four in Birkenstocks:
Ah, but — the day three press release had an ominous note in it. Right after telling us that Morton had “picked up a tub of couscous and a couple of bags of nuts for dinner” came the real kicker: our protagonist had a bad knee, and had bought new pedals to allow a switch to flat shoes. 
So on day four, Morton set off with his new pedals and covered both stage four and stage five of the actual Tour de France — in a pair of Birkenstocks. Despite his sensible sandals, Morton managed to average the same speeds as the day prior, getting through the time trial in 1:17.

In the mystery series, a New York University student is shot in Central Park on the Fourth of July, with no witnesses and no physical evidence found.
In "City on Fire," an NYU student is shot in Central Park on the Fourth of July, 2003. Samantha Cicciaro is alone; there are no witnesses and very little physical evidence. Her friends' band is playing her favorite downtown club but she leaves to meet someone, promising to return. She never does. As the crime against Samantha is investigated, she's revealed to be the crucial connection between a series of mysterious citywide fires, the downtown music scene, and a wealthy uptown real estate family fraying under the strain of the many secrets they keep.
The show is being created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who will also serve as showrunners and executive producers. Savage and Schwartz have developed shows like "Gossip Girl," "Nancy Drew," "The Astronaut Wives Club," "Dynasty," and more. The duo previously signed a first look deal with Apple.

And I am here for it
 Warframe’s story has recently brought a new antagonist to the forefront, and it looks like he’s getting some backup. The game’s next update, Sisters of Parvos, will arrive on July 6 and it brings a major new Corpus adversary for players to fight in exchange for sweet weapons.
Parvos Granum is the founder of the Corpus, and he’s returned from being in space limbo to lead the faction. That’s where the title “Sisters of Parvos” comes from — he went ahead and made some really powerful bodyguard ladies, and now they want to kill us. These assassins are the Corpus equivalent to the Grineer’s Kuva Liches, and players will have to undergo multiple encounters to either permanently kill them or add them as an ally to their crew.

Square Enix’s new collection brings updated graphics and music
 Square Enix has announced a release date for three games in its upcoming remaster anthology of the first six Final Fantasy games. The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster versions of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 2 and Final Fantasy 3, will launch July 28 for Android, iOS, and Windows PC via Steam. 
The next three games, Final Fantasy 4 through 6, have TBA 2021 launch dates for now. Square Enix first announced plans for the Pixel Remaster anthology at its E3 2021 news conference in June. 
All remasters will feature updated 2D pixel graphics, a soundtrack overseen by the series’ longtime composer, Nobuo Uematsu, a new user interface, and content bonuses like a bestiary, illustration gallery, and music player. 


The Steam page for the Pixel Remaster version of Final Fantasy says the game is based on the original Final Fantasy that launched in 1987, but its “features and/or content may differ from previously rereleased versions of the game.” The page did not list any system requirements for the games. 
The full Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster bundle is also available for pre-order and is priced at $95.94. Individual games are priced between $11.99 and $17.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft earlier this week made its Xbox Cloud Gaming service available on iOS devices, which means iPhone and iPad users can play Xbox games using the Safari browser.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


We decided to test out Xbox Cloud Gaming to see how it works at launch, and whether it's worth the $14.99 subscription price for the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which is how you can get access to Xbox Cloud Gaming.



In a nutshell, whether it's worth trying out depends on what you want to play. In our experience, and based on other accounts from people who have tested the service, there's latency, sometimes bad and sometimes just sporadic. The lag doesn't make most games unplayable, but it does affect competitive online shooters.



Latency can depend on connection, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming is fine if you have stellar internet speeds, but most reports so far suggest that it needs to be further refined for games where latency is a dealbreaker. We found we could adjust to the very slight delays for sports games and other titles, but with shooters, gameplay was hampered.



Given the latency issues, we wouldn't recommend the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription strictly for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but if it's something that you already have, it's a great bonus feature. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate provides access to more than 100 games on Xbox, PCs, and mobile devices, plus same day release access to Xbox Game Studios titles.



If you want to try out Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can pay $1 to get three months of access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. After that three-month period, the subscription is priced at $14.99 per month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple now considers the 2015 version of the 12-inch MacBook to be vintage, and has added the machine to its vintage products list as of today.





The 12-inch MacBook, also known as the "Retina MacBook," was meant to be a smaller, lighter version of the MacBook Air, and it was equipped with an Intel Core M processor. It was the smallest Mac with a Retina display, and it also featured a fanless design.



Apple continued updating the 12-inch MacBook in 2016 and 2017, but ultimately discontinued it in 2019 in favor of the updated ‌MacBook Air‌ with Retina display as the two machines were quite similar. When it was available, the 12-inch MacBook was priced at $1,299.



For most vintage products, the designation means that they're no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of select vintage products. Devices are considered vintage when Apple stopped distributing them for sale more than five and less than seven years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple recently dropped the $19.99 fee for OS X Lion and Mountain Lion, making the older Mac updates free to download, reports Macworld.





Apple has kept OS X 10.7 Lion and OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion available for customers who have machines limited to the older software, but until recently, Apple was charging $19.99 to get download codes for the updates.



As of last week, these updates no longer require a fee, and can be downloaded from the OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion support documents on Apple's website.



Mac OS X Lion is compatible with Macs that have an Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor, a minimum of 2GB RAM, and 7GB storage space.



Mac OS X Mountain Lion is compatible with the following Macs:



 	
iMac (Mid 2007-2020)


 	
MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)


 	
MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)


 	
MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)


 	
Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)


 	
Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)


 	
Xserve (Early 2009)




Macs that shipped with Mac OS X Mavericks or later are not compatible with the installer, however.



The $19.99 fee dates back to when Apple used to charge for Mac updates. Apple began making Mac updates free with the launch of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, which also marked the shift from big cat names to California landmark names.



Mavericks was free to download, and Apple has not charged for Mac software since then outside of the legacy Lion and Mountain Lion updates. Apple also used to have OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard available for a fee, but it is no longer purchasable.

How the developers learned from the popular Zelda game
 Link’s jump is heavy. And when the hero hops off the side of a cliff, he’s got only a simple cloth glider to catch his fall. Gravity makes the gliding in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild feel vulnerable, but the design still captures the tranquility of floating through the air. The balance between peace and unease makes Link’s travel feel real and important. 
In Sable, the new third-person adventure game by Shedworks, that sort of climbing and gliding is an even more essential part of the gameplay. If I jump off one of Sable’s rocky desert cliffs as the game’s titular hero, I’m embraced by a warm, orangish red bubble that feels safer than Breath of the Wild, but evokes the same fee…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming watchOS 8 update to its public beta testing group, allowing non-developers to experience the software ahead of its fall release.





The ‌watchOS 8‌ update can be downloaded after upgrading your iPhone to the public beta version of iOS 15. After installing ‌iOS 15‌, the proper ‌watchOS 8‌ profile from Apple's beta software website must also be installed.



The software can be accessed by going to General > Software Update in the Apple Watch app on ‌iPhone‌. To update, ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌.



‌watchOS 8‌, like ‌iOS 15‌, introduces improvements to the Wallet app with support for driver's licenses and new types of keys for homes, cars, and hotels. The Home app lets you see who is at the door with HomeKit-enabled cameras, plus the Home app has been updated to make it easier to get to HomeKit accessories and scenes.



There are new Tai Chi and Pilates workout types, and the Breathe app has been renamed to Mindfulness because it has a new "Reflect" feature that gives you thoughtful notions to consider to for mindfulness purposes. A Portrait Watch Face pulls portrait photos from the ‌iPhone‌, and the Photos app has new ways to view and navigate photos collections.



There's a new Find My app for locating lost items and devices right from the wrist, and the Messages app now supports sending GIFs. There are tons of other new features in ‌watchOS 8‌, with details available in our watchOS 8 roundup.

Public beta testers can download the tvOS 15 beta update by opening up the Settings app on the ‌Apple TV‌, navigating to the Software Updates section under "System," and then toggling on "Get public Beta Updates" after signing up to beta test on Apple's public beta website.



tvOS updates are often minor in scale, but there are some notable new additions that are coming. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there's a new "For All of You" recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound, and if you have HomeKit cameras, you can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.



Apple may add new features or refine existing features throughout the tvOS 15 beta testing process, with the software set to be released in the fall.

The C58 and Nail Gun both got a nerf
 Call of Duty: Warzone is just a few weeks into season 4, so there are still a few balance tweaks to be made to the new weapons. In the latest Warzone patch, Raven Software is bringing nerfs to the C58 assault rifle and the Nail Gun.
After its addition with season 4, the C58 quickly proved to be one of Warzone’s strongest assault rifles, so it makes sense that Raven is trying to pull back some of that power. In the new patch, the weapon has slightly higher recoil, making its fire a little harder to control. Raven Software also applied a similar recoil nerf to the FARA 83, a weapon that’s been one of Warzone’s strongest for quite a while now. 
The Nail Gun also got a nerf in this patch. According to Raven, the Nai…]]></summary>

Top-of-the-line consoles get three graphical modes; everyone gets two new levels
 Doom Eternal’s free upgrade for the newest consoles, which packs three new graphics modes (two for the Xbox Series S), is now available for those who have the original game. We’ll point out that Doom Eternal is on the buffet of Bethesda Softworks titles that joined Xbox Game Pass in the spring, so this upgrade covers a lot more than the folks who bought it outright in March 2020.
Update 6 also brings new content to all versions of the game. Taras Nabad is a new Master Level challenge, taking players to “the capital of Argent D’Nur,” according to the patch notes. There’s also a new 2v1 Battlemode arena, Corrosion, to go with improvements to Battlemode, including balance changes and bandwidth optimizations. All players also get a chromed-out Ray Tracer Ballista weapon skin to show off the new hardware’s capability.


For the upgraded version, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S all get Performance and Balanced graphical modes, HDR 10 support in any graphics mode, “Ultra-Quality Style Graphics Settings,” and cross-generation Battlemode support with their console’s predecessor (PS4 or Xbox One). Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 get an additional Ray Tracing Mode running at 1800p resolution and 60 frames per second.
Doom Eternal on PlayStation 5 adds support for the DualSense’s adaptive triggers; Xbox Series X and Series S both have variable refresh rates and variable rate shadings.
As for the graphical modes: Balanced Mode on PS5 and Series X offers 4K resolution and 60 fps; on Series S, it’s 1440p and 60 fps. Performance Mode for Series X is 1800p and 120 fps; for PlayStation 5, it’s 1584p and 120 fps. For Series S, it’s 1080p, 120 frames per second.
As far as the Windows PC version of Doom Eternal, Bethesda says only that the Ray Tracing Mode is available dependent on hardware.]]></summary>

“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by The Verge. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”
The Verge presents this as Apple shooting down a popular groundswell campaign within Apple (headline: “Apple Isn’t Backing Down From Its Hybrid Work Model, According to Internal Note”). That’s not the case. In-person collaboration is key to Apple’s culture (and success), and most Apple folks get that. And like I wrote a few weeks ago, it’s not that Apple’s leadership isn’t listening or hasn’t learned much from the last 16 months — they have, and this hybrid model is the result. But the decision was made, so there’s nothing to “back down” from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it plans to hold its quarter three earnings call for the 2021 fiscal year on July 27, 2021. 





During the third quarter, which includes late March through late June, the company made several major announcements, including brand new iPad Pros, redesigned 24-inch iMac, AirTags, and a new Apple TV. Additionally, the company held its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where it announced major updates to all of its platforms coming to users this fall.  



During the second quarter, Apple recorded a March quarter record of $89.6 billion in revenue, while its Mac and Services business reached an all-time new high. As has been normal for the past year, Apple is not providing guidance for the June quarter given the instability fueled by the global health crisis. However, during the earnings call last quarter, Apple's CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects a "sequential revenue decline" for the June quarter.

June quarter revenues to grow strong double digits year over year, but we believe sequential revenue decline from March to June will be greater than prior years. First, due to later launch timing and strong demand, ‌iPhone‌ only achieved supply/demand balance during the March quarter. Steeper sequential decline than usual. Supply constraints will have revenue impact of $3-4 billion.




The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide coverage of both the earnings release and conference call on July 27.

Want speed? We’ve got it. 
 Next up on the draft board, we pivot to another speedy winger, and one of the standouts from this year’s U18s.
Chibrikov had himself, on the whole, a very solid season. After starting the season putting up close a point per game at the junior level in the MHL, he quickly earned a promotion, and spent the rest of the season between the VHL and KHL, getting a taste of the professional game. We, as expected, didn’t see that scoring pace directly translate, but Chibrikov made a difficult jump at a young age, and found a way to look quite good in doing so. There’s a lot to like about his game, and he seems to just be scratching the surface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is continuing to struggle to meet demand for mini-LED displays in its recently launched 12.9-inch iPad Pro and displays in upcoming MacBook Pros, prompting the company to begin looking for extra suppliers in an attempt to ease the load.





According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report slated to be published tomorrow, Apple is looking for suppliers beyond Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology, or TSMT, to assist in mounting electrical components onto circuit boards for the mini-LED display in the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and upcoming MacBook Pros.



DigiTimes had previously reported that TSMT would remain the sole supplier of SMT (surface mounting technology) for the ‌iPad Pro‌ and the upcoming MacBook Pro. Since that report, however, Apple has seemed to change its outlook on the situation, potentially realizing that demand for the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and expected demand for the upcoming MacBook Pro may exceed the capabilities of a single supplier.



Following its launch, Apple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ was rather limited in stock, with shipping times at the time of launch in April reaching mid and late July. Due to continued disruptions thanks to the global health crisis and global chip shortage, a similar scenario may be in practice with upcoming MacBook Pros.



Apple's M1-powered 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ was the first Apple product to feature the company's Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED, rather than traditional LCD or OLED. Apple is expected to bring this same technology to redesigned MacBook Pros expected to launch later this year.

All devices, regardless of brand or condition, can be traded in for free to Apple as part of the company's commitment to be environmentally friendly. A wide assortment of devices ranging from Blackberry to HTC phones can also be traded in for an Apple Store gift card.



Apple's trade-in program is meant to serve as an incentive to get users of other smartphone brands to switch to ‌iPhone‌ by offering them discounts on their purchase. Apple recently added the Pixel 4, Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 to its list of eligible Android devices for ‌iPhone‌ credit trade-in.

His name has floated around the rumor mill.
 As of late, the buzz around the Flyers and Seth Jones has almost reached a palpable high. The offseason news, with the Stanley Cup Final rightfully taking the front page headlines in the hockey world, has been thin, with most rumors being simply that: rumors. With any news pertaining to the Flyers, after a woeful 56 games, we find ourselves grasping at straws for anything to give us hope for the 2021-22 season. And yet, though it is still simply a rumor, the Seth Jones conversation hasn’t gone away, but has in fact magnified. 
This is of no doubt thanks to continued reports that the Flyers are very interested in acquiring the 26-year-old defenseman. In Elliotte Friedman’s newest 31 Thoughts blog, he h…]]></summary>

According to Satechi, the Mac mini Stand & Hub was designed to optimize the M1 ‌Mac mini‌. It connects to a ‌Mac mini‌ over USB-C and adds three USB-A data ports, micro/SD card readers, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, plus it supports an SSD for additional storage.



As with most Satechi accessories, the ‌Mac mini‌ Stand & Hub is made from a brushed silver aluminum alloy to match the color and design of the ‌Mac mini‌. It is sized to the ‌Mac mini‌, so it looks like a natural add-on to Apple's smallest desktop computer.





The Type-C Stand & Hub for Mac Mini with SSD Enclosure is available from Amazon or from the Satechi website for $99.99, with a 15 percent discount available when using the code MACMINISSD at checkout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of what is expected to be a busy fall season with multiple new product launches, Apple is enlisting additional suppliers of mmWave antennas for the iPhone 13, according to a new report from DigiTimes. 





5G mmWave technology debuted in the iPhone 12, and compared to traditional sub-6Ghz, mmWave offers significantly faster speeds but is limited in distance. Currently, mmWave ‌iPhone 12‌ models are only available in the United States, but this fall, Apple is planning a larger expansion of mmWave iPhones to more countries worldwide.



mmWave technology has increased in adoption in cities; however, with the ‌iPhone 13‌ expanding the technology to more customers, it may push countries to adopt mmWave infrastructure faster. DigiTimes reports that Apple is planning to boost the ratio of 5G mmWave iPhones to as many as to 60% of its 2021 iPhone lineup, with shipments reaching 90 million units. 

Apple is expected to sharply boost the ratio of 5G mmWave devices to 60% of its new ‌iPhone‌ lineup in 2021, with such models estimated to approach 90 million units, the sources said, adding that each mmWave ‌iPhone‌ will require four AiP modules, significantly driving up demand for AiP substrates.
The ‌iPhone 13‌, expected to be announced between September and October, is rumored to include other significant features such as an improved display, improved cameras, and faster performance. Learn more about everything we're expecting using our guide.

Apple's new delivery and pickup page in China (translated)
 

In-store pickup has been available for some time now in most countries and has become a popular choice for many Apple customers ordering products online in situations where it would be more convenient or quicker than waiting for home delivery. The service has also allowed Apple to limit footfall in its retail stores, with many customers doing their product browsing via the website instead.



Shoppers can opt to pickup at their local Apple store and receive a notification when their products arrive, and this service has now been extended to China, albeit with one exception.



As noted by 9to5Mac, anyone choosing in-store pickup in China will need to bring proof of ID to show that they personally made the order, whereas in other countries it's possible to designate someone else to collect the order for you.



For more information, customers in China can check out Apple's delivery and pickup page.

Now, this is podracing!
 Luckily for us, developers are constantly documenting highlights from the game-making process with the hashtag #ScreenshotSaturday. These posts — which can come in the form of GIFs, screenshots, and video clips —  allow fans to feast on the characters and worlds long before the release of the games. So we’ve rounded up some of the coolest works-in-progress we saw thanks to #ScreenshotSaturday to give you a sneak peek into all the fun stuff that excites us. 
This week’s list includes a chunky and pixelated podracing game inspired by Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Another post also showed off the early stages of a fan-made 3D version of Earthbound.

Lots to do and old friends to see
 World of Warcraft: Shadowlands has been in its launch phase for months, as Tuesday’s 9.1 patch is the first piece of content created entirely under Blizzard Entertainment’s work-from-home protocols. Chains of Dominations changes up the current anima grind and Covenant quests by introducing a smorgasbord of new content for players who are focused on the endgame.
First — and most prominent — is the new zone of Korthia, the City of Secrets. Korthia is the next frontier of the Maw, and the Covenants are showing up to fight back against the Jailer. There are two new reputations and a ton of mounts to collect in the area, as well as new gear and quests. If you’re looking for a new horsie or bat to ride, this patch is a pre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[T-Mobile has made it easier than ever for iPhone owners contemplating a carrier switch to test out its network, adding eSIM support to its existing Test Drive Program.






As noted by Light Reading (via The Verge), those who have an ‌iPhone‌ that supports eSIM can download the T-Mobile Network Test Drive app to try out the T-Mobile network, a feature that T-Mobile rolled out last week.



T-Mobile says that the T-Mobile Network Test Drive gives customers up to 30 days or 30GB of high-speed data along with unlimited talk and text for free, while maintaining their current phone number and carrier.



To facilitate this, T-Mobile provides a temporary number that can be used for calls and texts if so desired, though by default, a customer's primary number with an existing network provider will be used for calls and texts.



The Network Test Drive app works with the ‌iPhone‌ XS and newer, as eSIM capabilities are required to use it. The ‌iPhone‌ used for the test must be unlocked, it must be on iOS 14.5 or higher, and an eSIM cannot be in use for a customer's existing provider.



Those who want to sign up can download the T-Mobile Network Test Drive app from the App Store, following the installation and activation instructions from there.



T-Mobile has long offered a Test Drive service to allow customers to try its data network before committing, but prior to the introduction of the eSIM (and for those without eSIM functionality), T-Mobile mailed out hotspot devices.

 Control, a video game full of strange things that no one can really explain, is getting a spinoff that is aptly inexplicable: a multiplayer game. 
Dubbed Project Condor by developer Remedy Entertainment, the game will be a 4-player player-vs-environment (PvE) co-op game set in the world of Control. Besides that very Left 4 Dead-sounding genre descriptor, details are scant. A blog post from Mikael Kasurinen, game director of the Control franchise, emphasizes the “world” part, noting that Control protagonist Jesse Faden’s journey into the Oldest House was just a small part of that world and that Condor is an expression of how much bigger it can be. Kasurinen also shared this bit of concept art, which Kasurinen claims “tells pretty well what Condor is about.”

That may be a joke.
Also tucked away in the Condor announcement was an agreement with 505 games to publish a “a bigger-budget Control-game, to be agreed in more detail in the future,” which is the first official statement from Remedy about a Control sequel. All we know now is that it will be more expensive, which makes sense, as dealing with sentient buildings and extradimensional entities tends to have a way of running up a tab.]]></summary>

Cryptic Studios said the game will not be released, and that the studio has “no plans” to revive the game in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming watchOS 7.6 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming two weeks after the release of the third beta.





To install the ‌watchOS 7.6 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the iPhone by going to General > Software Update.



To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



We don't know what's included in the watchOS 7.6 update, and no new features were discovered in the first three betas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming tvOS 14.7 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming two weeks after Apple seeded the third tvOS 14.7 beta.





Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV models, the tvOS 14.7 developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There's no word yet on what's included in tvOS 14.7 update, but we'll update this article should anything new be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

Using a contemporary copy of the full scene painted by Gerrit Lundens and an AI program for getting the colors and angles right, the Rijksmuseum has “restored” The Night Watch, augmenting the painting with digital printouts of the missing bits.


Edith Zimmerman got access to this technology and ran some of her own experiments of famous artworks. You may be shocked and delighted at what she found.

A legendary bow! A mount! And more!
 Today’s World of Warcraft patch is a big one. Chains of Domination, also known as patch 9.1, brings a new raid, zone, new end-game systems, and 40 new mounts. The final boss of that raid is Sylvanas Windrunner, and fans have been waiting to beat her ass for a long time now. If you’re still on her side, Blizzard has made her one of the juiciest loot pinatas in the game for years to come — she has a legendary bow, unique weapons, and a mount.
Sylvanas has been the antagonist throughout Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands, and if you’ve been playing since the old days of the game, you may have a grudge against her for her actions in 2010’s Cataclysm expansion. She’s spent the last eleven years just being the absolute w…]]></summary>

The Arizona Coyotes are selling everything and the Flyers should be in on it.
 The Philadelphia Flyers should do as much as possible to overcome any shortcomings from last season. Self-destructive goaltending aside, the Flyers were an alright team up top and a miserable catastrophe on the blue line.
But truly, why not solve any problems you have by getting a really, really good forward that can make life easier on everyone wearing the same uniform on the ice? We’re creeping towards position-less hockey anyway, so getting someone that will no doubt make your team better, no matter the area they most commonly exist in on the ice, is the way to go.
Especially when a team is essentially selling anything that isn’t bolted to the desert floor.…]]></summary>

Crow mercy
 The machinery of death works much like an office, with people hoping for big upcoming quarters and complaining about paperwork. The world of death is black, white, and weirdly relatable. Early on, I lose a soul I was sent to reap, which is a pretty big deal back at HQ. My crow is sent back out into the mortal world, which is colorful, overgrown, and full of monsters. 
In Death’s Door, I’m an adorable little bird with a sword, a bow, and a mission to collect as many souls as possible. It’s not easy being a little crow up against enormous beasts, but it’s a living. If I die in the mortal world, I’m sent back to the start — but I get to keep all the goodies I found along the way, making each run a little easier.

An undersized winger who can fill up the net? Sounds like a guy to pass out for sure.
 After another dip into the defensive pool we’ve got a stone cold sniper on our hands in record-setting Matthew Coronato out of the USHL and the Chicago Steel. The Harvard commit set Steel team records for scoring at a blazing pace last year and earned the nickname “the Bison” for crashing the net and showing no fear going into the high-danger areas to score. 
Sweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has dramatically increased the amount of iCloud user data it stores on Google Cloud, according to The Information.





The report claims Apple now has over eight million terabytes of data stored on Google's servers. As of mid-May, Apple was reportedly on track to spend around $300 million on Google cloud storage services this year, which would represent an increase of roughly 50% from all of 2020. Apple is said to be the largest corporate client for Google Cloud, dwarfing other high-profile customers like Spotify.



Google Cloud staffers have apparently even given Apple an internal code name that hints at its size as a customer: "Bigfoot."



Apple relies on a combination of its own data centers and third-party cloud storage services, such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, to store iCloud user data like photos and messages. Apple does not provide third-party cloud storage providers with the keys to decrypt user data stored on their servers, ensuring a strong level of security.



The report speculates that Apple's increased use of Google Cloud suggests the company's rising cloud storage requirements have outpaced its ability to develop and operate its own data centers needed to handle the resulting data.

With Montreal unexpectedly in the Stanley Cup Final, can we see Philadelphia do something similar?
 Every fan base wants to be part of one and it’s human nature to want to cheer for one. It’s the age-old tale of an underdog. All the odds are against them in the trivial fight to be declared the champion, but they go on to win it all (or get close) in a monumental and emotional and compelling series of games that can last them through a handful of seasons — no matter what their management decides to do or who they trade away.
It is something that is so cherished and talked about even from neutral observers of any sport, just something so incredible and captivating that can be discussed beyond the normal fanatic circles.

Apple suppliers are reportedly hurrying to increase capacity in preparation for the release of new MacBooks and ‌AirPods‌ in the second half of this year. Shipment momentum is expected to be "significantly stronger" from the third quarter of the year at the earliest, improving order fulfillment.



Shin Zu Shing supplies bearings to Apple for MacBooks, ‌AirPods‌ charging cases, and AirPods Max headbands, and is currently believed to be cooperating with Apple to supply bearings for new MacBook and ‌AirPods‌ products. The supplier is said to be struggling to meet demand and is in the process of hiring more manpower to expand production capacity.

The app market research firm says consumer spending on in-app purchases, subscriptions, premium apps and games in the ‌App Store‌ was 1.8 times the revenue generated by Google's Play Store, which generated $23.4 billion over the same period.



Despite ‌App Store‌ spending, however, Google Play is projected to enjoy stronger year-on-year growth overall because of activity in markets still feeling the impact of the global health crisis. 



In the first half of 2021, the ‌App Store‌ has grown 22.1 percent from about $34 billion in the H1 2020, a little more than seven percentage points lower…]]></summary>

*There are a lot of reasons to root for the Habs in this series, but perhaps the most relevant to your interest is the success of former Flyer good guy Luke Richardson. [The Athletic]
*We made our predictions for the series yesterday and we are all over the dang place with this one. [BSH]
*I don’t think there is any question that the player to watch at training camp in a couple of months will be Cam York. [Inquirer]
*We’re back to the defense with the latest pick on our Community Draft Board. [BSH]
*Conn Smythe; who ya got? Carey Price still seems like the safe bet. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Whenever we get around to talking about how to prevent dirty hits — which seems to happen a lot lately! — the conversation inevitably turns to the idea that if enforcers were still around, this wouldn’t happen. But is that true? [Yahoo Sports]

        <updated>2021-06-28T23:52:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mark Gurman, in the premiere edition of his newsletter for Bloomberg, Power On:
Let’s get right to the point: I wrote this newsletter on an iPad
Pro. That might not sound like some shocking revelation, but trust
me, I had all but relegated the tablet to video watching and light
gaming duties. Since this month’s release of the iPadOS 15 beta,
however, I’ve left my laptop mostly behind and have done the vast
majority of my work from the iPad.
Now I have even stronger feelings for what Apple Inc. needs to
change about the iPad — and it goes beyond software. It’s time
for a giant screen, one in the 14-inch to 16-inch range. I love
the speed, touchscreen, versatility and Magic Keyboard, but the
12.9-inch display is far too small for someone accustomed to a
16-inch MacBook Pro.
And I’m not the only one who thinks that: I’m told that Apple has
engineers and designers exploring larger iPads that could hit
stores a couple of years down the road at the earliest. They’re
unlikely for next year — with Apple’s attention on a redesigned
iPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022 — and it’s possible they
never come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for
many people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines
between tablet and laptop.
I dig the conversational tone here. Gurman is, indisputably, the best and most accurate Apple rumor reporter. But his writing feels held back by Bloomberg’s restrictive house style for reporting. With this newsletter he’s freed from all the repetitive boilerplate about “people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because blah blah blah”.
As for bigger iPads, would a 16-inch iPad still be hand-holdable? If not, would it be in a true laptop enclosure? Or could they make it hand-holdable by making it even thinner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaim Gartenberg, writing for The Verge:
Within that mess of product names are two core issues: Google’s
apparent love of launching new services and its inability to
combine products under one umbrella.
Competitors like WhatsApp demonstrate what the opposite approach
could be: a chat service tied to a user’s phone number that allows
for video and voice, all from one app. Or there’s Apple’s iPhone
approach, which ties email addresses and phone numbers to two
services: iMessage for text and FaceTime for audio and video.
Google keeps falling into the same cycle, though, one that has
repeated itself throughout the years. It’ll build out new
services, integrating them into more areas of its product lineup,
then try to wipe the slate clean, launch new services that
(eventually) replace the old set, and start the cycle anew.
Eye-opening to see it all laid out on a timeline like this. My first thought was that this exemplified my argument the other day about Google’s lack of institutional focus. But it sort of works against my argument that Sundar Pichai is shepherding Google in a more focused direction — a bunch of these false steps in messaging were under his leadership.
It really is quite a comparison to email, where Gmail was announced in 2004 — while Google was still a nascent company — and they haven’t wavered since.

Apple became the fifth largest PC brand in India in the first
quarter of 2021, with shipments of desktops, notebooks, tablets
and workstations combined to reach 208,000 units, according to
data from Canalys. Canalys pointed out that the significant
increase in Apple’s notebook and tablet shipments in India was due
mainly to Apple opening its online store in September 2020.
Research firm IDC’s figures also show Apple’s PC shipments in
India (excluding tablets) grew 335.5% on year in the first quarter
and only lagged Asustek’s by around 2,000 units.
iPhone sales in India are up to, but these numbers are about the Mac and (I think) iPads. A lot has changed for Apple in the last 20 years, but one thing remains unchanged: they sell more products when they have their own stores, online or physical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satya Nadella, in a terrific, wide-ranging interview with Nilay Patel:
The other point is it also lives in an ecosystem. Let’s say
Windows has a billion users. So does Android. So does iOS. In
fact, Android and iOS will have more than a billion users perhaps,
or maybe Android has 2 billion, [and] maybe iOS is similar to
Windows’s size or what have you. But the reality is any Windows user — we have to start with the assumption that they have a phone and
that phone may be Android and iOS and we have to design for it.
I do think that operating systems are important, but they’re
important in so far as they compose with everything else that’s
part of my life, whether it’s other devices with other operating
systems, [or] whether it is clouds that I use, which are powering
some of the applications and experiences.
It’s a practical reality, really. Let’s meet Windows users
where they are, and meet their current needs and unmet,
unarticulated needs.
I crack wise about the inelegance of Windows, but I do think that under Nadella, Microsoft knows what Windows is and what it’s supposed to be, and Windows 11 is exactly that. That’s a strength. That know thyself confidence comes across in this interview.

Milan-based Milestone, known for hardcore, licensed racing simulations like Monster Energy Supercross 4 and the MotoGP franchise, gets an opportunity to stretch its legs creatively with the die-cast collectible cars, and they do not waste the moment one bit.

But after actually playing the Stranger of Paradise demo, I’ve flipped my opinion. In fact, it only took one novel idea to elevate this Final Fantasy punchline to one of my most anticipated releases for 2022: the Soul Shield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming service is officially launching today and is now available to be used on the iPhone and iPad through the Safari browser, says Microsoft.





As of today, Xbox Cloud Gaming is available to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members with Apple smartphones and tables and Windows 10 PC users. The service can be accessed by visiting xbox.com/play on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or Safari on a mobile device or on PC.



Two weeks ago, Microsoft said that Xbox Cloud Gaming would be launching on Apple devices "in the next few weeks" following a limited beta test for a small number of users.



Xbox Cloud Gaming is designed to allow users to play hundreds of games from the Xbox Game Pass library on any device using a web browser. According to Microsoft, the service is now powered by Xbox Series X hardware in upgraded Microsoft data centers to deliver faster load times and improved framerates.



To ensure low latency, Microsoft plans to stream at 1080p at up to 60 frames per second, and the service is designed to offer seamless play across all devices. Using Xbox Cloud Gaming requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which is priced at $14.99 per month. New users can get a three month free trial for $1.



Along with a full rollout of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Microsoft today announced that it is expanding its Designed for Xbox mobile gaming accessory lineup to iOS devices, with several new accessories available starting today.





The Xbox Backbone One, for example, is an iPhone-compatible gaming controller with built-in Xbox integrations such as a Capture Button for sharing gameplay moments. Microsoft is also touting the Razer Kishi Universal Gaming Controller for iOS and OtterBox Power Swap Controller Batteries.

"We're pleased to let you know your account has been enabled for Xcode Cloud beta," reads the email sent out to developers. "You can now take advantage of continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode 13."




Xcode Cloud, let’s goooo pic.twitter.com/Fj9l8R1bsj
— Steve Streza 🏳️‍🌈 (@SteveStreza) June 28, 2021
 


Xcode Cloud is a cloud-based Xcode service that allows developers to build, test, and deliver high-quality apps in the cloud rather than directly on a Mac.
Xcode Cloud is a new continuous integration and delivery cloud service designed specifically for Apple developers. Built into Xcode 13, Xcode Cloud offers a fast and simple way for developers and teams of all sizes to build, test, and deliver high-quality apps even more efficiently. Xcode Cloud can automatically build apps in the cloud to free up developers' Macs for other tasks. Parallel testing in the cloud means developers can test on a simulated version of every current Apple device, then easily deploy a build of the app for internal testing, or deliver to external beta testers through TestFlight for instant feedback.
Apple has been allowing developers to sign up for the Xcode Cloud waitlist prior to now, and there are multiple reports on Twitter from developers who have been granted beta access. All developers who are Account Holders in the Apple Developer Program as of June 7, 2021 are eligible to sign up for Xcode Cloud, though a Mac with the latest beta version of Xcode 13 is required.

 It’s the end of the line, folks! We’ve finally arrived at the Cup Final! We expected that these playoffs were going to be weird, and boy did they ever deliver. Three rounds later and we’re staring down a matchup between the Tampa Bay Lightning... and the Montreal Canadiens. Sure, why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google today announced the launch of a new "4K Plus" plan for YouTube TV subscribers, which will allow for streaming in 4K on a compatible TV and set-top box.





Along with 4K streaming, the 4K Plus option includes an option to download shows for watching offline and unlimited streaming when connected to home WiFi.



4K Plus is priced at an additional $19.99 per month on top of the standard YouTube TV streaming price, which starts at $65. That means subscribers can expect to pay $85 per month to watch YouTube TV in 4K, though Google is offering a promotion.



New users can get a one-month free trial and then will pay $9.99 per month for a year, after which the price will increase to $19.99 per month.



For all YouTube TV subscribers, Google is adding 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities, which will start rolling out to select devices "in the coming weeks." YouTube TV 4K Plus is available for customers starting today, with the feature accessible under membership settings on any browser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past several months, I’ve read several pieces about the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 and have been frustrated with the certainty with which folks who should know better have embraced the “lab leak hypothesis”. So, I was happy to see Zeynep Tufekci’s characteristically even-handed and comprehensive overview of the evidence about the virus’s origins in the NY Times.
While the Chinese government’s obstruction may keep us from knowing for sure whether the virus, SARS-CoV-2, came from the wild directly or through a lab in Wuhan or if genetic experimentation was involved, what we know already is troubling.
Years of research on the dangers of coronaviruses, and the broader history of lab accidents and errors around the world, provided scientists with plenty of reasons to proceed with caution as they investigated this class of pathogens. But troubling safety practices persisted.
Worse, researchers’ success at uncovering new threats did not always translate into preparedness.
Even if the coronavirus jumped from animal to human without the involvement of research activities, the groundwork for a potential disaster had been laid for years, and learning its lessons is essential to preventing others.


Is it possible that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab? Yes. Is it probable? We can’t know that right now. It’s a tantalizing puzzle involving a possible cover-up, but irresponsibly assigning certainty to the situation does no one but attention-seeking pundits any good.

Designer’s German shepherd guided famed sidekick’s behavior and personality
 Fallout 4’s real-life Dogmeat — a German Shepherd named River, in the care of designer Joel Burgess — has passed away. By all accounts, she was a good girl.
“What we wanted was a companion first, and a combat ally second,” Burgess wrote — of Dogmeat — on Twitter on Sunday. In a thread memorializing River, he recalled that he stopped over to the desk of a new developer on the Fallout 4 team, one tasked with building the Dogmeat character, and “Research covered the walls; countless images of German Shepherds snarling, all teeth and attack postures.”
“Within a day or two, River started visiting the studio,” Burgess wrote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snapchat's support account today confirmed on Twitter that its latest App Store update, pushed less than one day ago, is causing widespread issues for users, specifically causing the app to crash a few seconds after launch.





The latest ‌App Store‌ update, version 11.34.05.45, is listed as a normal update with bug fixes, but it has caused widespread crashes for users. Over the last few hours, Twitter has been bombarded with users reporting the issue, with no fix currently available. Snapchat, at the time of writing, has not yet pulled the update and says it is working on a fix. The fix will likely come in the form of a new ‌App Store‌ version.



Snapchat users on previous versions of Snapchat for iOS should be clear of any app crashes. For users impacted by the latest update, be sure to keep the app up to date by periodically checking the ‌App Store‌ for any updates or by enabling automatic ‌App Store‌ updates within Settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a filmstrip version of Margaret Wise Brown’s Goodnight Moon produced in 1984. Not sure what a filmstrip is? Boing Boing explains:
From the 1940s until the low-cost videocassette boom of the 1980s, audio filmstrips were commonly used in classrooms as an alternative to 16mm film projectors that were more expensive and fiddly to keep working.


This post doubles as one of those “say how old you are without saying how old you are” Twitter prompts. Here’s more on filmstrips from the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences:
While the show was a welcome diversion from parsing, long division and dictation, what we didn’t realise was the filmstrips were an educational revolution in Australia akin to smart boards today. They were stored in neat little canisters which could be easily dispatched to schools. Accompanying them was a script read by the teacher describing the 25 or so images depicted in the films, which were manually advanced in the projector.


Until watching this Goodnight Moon video, I had totally forgotten about the beep used in filmstrip audio used to signal someone to switch to the next frame.

The mobile defender has seen his draft stock slide in the past year, to the point of possible overcorrection.
 Every year, there’s a prospect whose standing within the scouting community takes an unforeseen hit; this is sometimes deserved, but in other cases a product of circumstance. Often there are draft-eligible players who fall below lofty expectations, yet become solid or better NHL players. Carson Lambos falls squarely within the crosshairs of this characterization after what could be considered a disappointing 2020-21 campaign.
It was a chaotic year for all the players in this draft, but perhaps Lambos had the roughest time among the high-profile ones. After a brief, yet alarming run in Finland’s Liiga, U18 and U20 leagues, Lambos retu…]]></summary>

To turn a group voice chat into a group video call, users can tap the camera icon at the bottom of the screen. Tapping a participant's video makes it go fullscreen, and a pin icon in the top-right corner of the screen lets you pin the video, which makes it stay focused as new users join the call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just a few months away from when Apple is expected to reveal the 2021 iPhone, dubbed the "iPhone 13." In preparation for its launch, it has been pulling in shipments of different components needed to produce the new iPhones, according to a report from DigiTimes.





In years past, Apple released its latest ‌iPhone‌ lineup, alongside a new Apple Watch, during a September event at Apple Park. Due to the global health crisis last year, the company was forced to delay the launch of the iPhone 12 to October, one month off its typical release schedule. Despite the delay last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones on time in September, according to well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  



Apple operates under dozens of suppliers based in China, the United States, Vietnam, and India to produce its devices. Lockdowns crippled many of Apple's supplier's ability to produce and assemble devices. TSMC, one of Apple's largest suppliers, has reportedly already started producing the A15 chip for the 2021 iPhone.



The iPhone 12 featured several changes, such as an updated flat-edged design, the introduction of LiDAR for the high-end Pro models, and improved cameras. Above all, however, Apple's largest selling point for the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ was the inclusion of 5G technology. For the upcoming iPhones, Apple may instead focus on marketing other aspects of the device, including an all-new always-on display with 120Hz ProMotion technology, improved cameras, and more. Check out our roundup to learn more about everything we're expecting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple enjoyed a "significant increase" in shipments in India in the first quarter of 2021, according to Canalys, suggesting the opening of its online store in the country late last year has been reaping rewards for the company (via DigiTimes). 





Launched in September 2020, Apple's Indian online store offers a full range of Apple products and accessories with shopping assistance from Apple Specialists, EDU pricing for students, free no-contact delivery, financing options, a trade-in program for iPhone sales, and more.



Driven largely by traffic to the store that led to subsequent purchases, Apple became the fifth largest computer brand in India in Q1, with shipments of desktops, notebooks, tablets, and workstations combined reaching 208,000 units.



Research firm IDC's figures also indicate Apple's computer shipments in India (excluding tablets) grew 335.5% year-on-year in the first quarter and only lagged behind Asustek's by around 2,000 units. Apple and Asustek were tied for fifth place in IDC's rankings for computer brands in India in the quarter.



In a January earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that its India online store had received a "tremendous" response since opening, and that it had doubled Apple's smartphone share in the country to 4% in the December quarter. Cook said that as a result of the success, Apple was bringing forward plans to launch brick-and-mortar retail stores in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-end models of the upcoming iPhone 13 lineup, such as the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, will feature an upgraded ultra-wide camera with autofocus, compared to the current fixed focal ultra-wide camera on iPhone 12 models, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investors note obtained by MacRumors. 





Compared to the current fixed-focus lens on the ultra-wide camera on the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup, autofocus on the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and Pro Max will help deliver crisper and sharper images, regardless of the distance a specific subject is from the lens. Kuo has previously stated that the ‌iPhone 13‌ will feature several other camera improvements, including improved low-light performance.



Looking more long-term, Kuo today shared additional information on the iPhone 14, destined for 2022. According to Kuo, while autofocus on the ‌iPhone 13‌ ultra-wide camera will be limited to the high-end Pro models only, Apple plans to expand autofocus for the ultra-wide camera to all four models of the iPhone 14 lineup.

        <updated>2021-06-27T14:13:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first edition of his new Power On newsletter for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman said Apple is exploring future iPads with larger displays, although he added that a potential release is likely at least a few years away if ever.





An excerpt from Gurman's newsletter, which also covers some reshuffling of the Apple Car team, Peloton working on a heart rate monitor, and more:
I'm told that Apple has engineers and designers exploring larger iPads that could hit stores a couple of years down the road at the earliest. They're unlikely for next year—with Apple's attention on a redesigned iPad Pro in the current sizes for 2022—and it's possible they never come at all. But a big iPad would be the perfect device for many people, including me, and would continue to blur the lines between tablet and laptop.
The current iPad Pro comes in 11-inch and 12.9-inch display sizes. In a previous Bloomberg report, Gurman and Debby Wu said Apple is testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back that would support wireless charging for release in 2022.



Larger display sizes would help further blur the lines between the iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro, which is available with up to a 16-inch display. However, many customers still believe iPadOS does not take full advantage of the iPad Pro's hardware, and Gurman opined that Apple ultimately needs to allow Mac apps and Mac-like multitasking with more flexible arrangements of app windows on the iPad Pro.



Apple last updated the iPad Pro in April with its custom-designed M1 chip, Thunderbolt support, 5G connectivity on cellular models, a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model, up to 2TB of storage, up to 16GB of RAM, and more.

In a support document, Adobe said users can easily migrate to its Fresco app, which combines many Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw drawing and painting tools. All projects created in Illustrator Draw and Photoshop Sketch will be automatically migrated to Fresco after a user signs into the app with their Adobe ID email address.



Existing users can continue to use Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw after July 19, with all artwork and projects remaining available, but Adobe said it will not add any new features or updates to the apps once they are discontinued.



Adobe Fresco first launched on the iPad in 2019 and expanded to the iPhone last year. The app is free on the App Store, with premium features available for $9.99.

Ultima Underworld 1+2, Syndicate Plus, and Syndicate Wars all leaving; all but Syndicate Wars are on Origin
 Three 1990s games from Electronic Arts’ Origin Systems PC line will be delisted from GOG.com on Monday, June 28. The titles are Ultima Underworld 1+2, Syndicate Wars, and Syndicate Plus, the 1996 re-release that comprises the first Syndicate and its expansion.
All three are currently available for $1.49 each. Anyone who buys the games before their delisting will still find them in their GOG.com library of titles after they’re taken down. They may still re-download them, too. The removal takes effect at 9 a.m. EDT on June 28.
GOG.com noted in a forum post Thursday that it was pulling the games on request from the publisher. Polygon has reached out to an Electronic Arts representative for additional comment. All of the games involved, except for Syndicate Wars, are currently available through EA’s Origin storefront.
Syndicate, by Peter Molyneux’s Bullfrog Productions, launched in 1993, with an expansion pack released later that year. It was followed by Syndicate Wars in 1996. The isometric real-time strategy and tactics game was rebooted in 2012 as a first-person shooter.
Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld 2: Labyrinth of Worlds launched in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Richard Garriott directed and Warren Spector produced the first game; Spector produced and Paul Neurath directed the second. The two were packaged together for sale on GOG.com in 2011.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting with iOS and iPadOS 15 later this fall, hotspot connections from iPhones and iPads will be secured with the improved WPA3 security protocol, offering improved security and upgraded measures in place to prevent password guessing.





WPA3 was announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in June of 2018 with the goal to "simplify Wi-Fi security, enable more robust authentication, and deliver increased cryptographic strength." On iOS 14, hotspot connections from an iPhone or iPad are secured only with WPA2, and now on updates coming later this fall, connections will be further protected with WPA3. 



Apple's products have been able to connect to networks with WPA3 security for several years, but until now, personal hotspot networks set up by those devices have only supported the older and weaker WPA2 standard.



For the typical user, the hotspot connection experience on iOS 15 will remain the same; however, there are added benefits. Despite recommendations to create strong, complicated, and advanced passwords for hotspot connections, many users continue to use simple passwords that may be easily guessed. WPA3 specifically targets such use cases, as it uses "more resilient, password-based authentication" that offers "stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties."



iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌ are currently being tested with developers, with a public beta being planned for later this summer. Check out our guide to see everything that's new.

Some offense coming from Sweden might be available.
 If there is just one young prospect that most casual and not-so-casual draft fanatics will be jumping for joy if their team snags him in the mid-to-late first round, it would be Fabian Lysell.
After a year bouncing between the Swedish junior league and the Swedish Hockey League, Lysell found himself of a Luleå HF team full of former NHL players (most notably former Philadelphia Flyer Erik Gustafsson, the other one) and a couple NHL Draft hopefuls. Due to the older, more experienced roster, the teenager wasn’t able to get a ton of ice-time and that can certainly explain his low point totals. Averaging just over seven minutes a game, Lysell was just there for the exper…]]></summary>

 One of Chicory: A Colorful Tale’s most pivotal scenes begins with a dark room. Eyes track and trace across the otherwise black screen, the crude drawings of neon eyes lighting up the space. My character, a dog I named Pancake, must face the inverted version of itself in a split-screen fight. 
In taking on the weight of a magical paintbrush’s legacy, Pancake must contend with a devastating corruption in self-doubt and personal worth, which comes to a head in this particular moment. 
It’s the literal interpretation of a sort of internal battle that’s familiar to so many people, the light taking on the dark and spun into a luminous, centerpiece battle t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Belkin introduced the Soundform Connect Audio Adapter with AirPlay 2, letting users turn their traditional speakers into AirPlay 2-enabled devices.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


MacRumors videographer Dan has now had a chance to spend some time with the accessory, so check out our latest video for a look at the setup process, using standalone speakers via ‌AirPlay‌, and integrating those speakers into a whole-home setup with other ‌AirPlay‌ 2 speakers.



Physical setup is dead simple, with a USB-C port on one side for power and both optical and 3.5mm analog audio out jacks on the other side, letting you easily connect it to your existing powered speakers, receiver, or amplifier. 



As is to be expected with ‌AirPlay‌ 2 devices, software setup is simple, with the Home app walking you through the process to get the dongle added to your existing home configuration. Once that's done, it's just a simple matter of selecting it as your audio output destination on your iOS or Mac device.



With ‌AirPlay‌ 2, you can use your newly connected speakers as part of a multi-room setup incorporating other speakers like HomePods, with audio output being synced across all speakers.



Integration with the Home app also gives you the ability to incorporate your speakers into scenes and other automations.



The Soundform Connect Audio Adapter with AirPlay 2 is priced at $99.99, so it's not exactly cheap, but if you got a nice sound system that lacks ‌AirPlay‌ support, this adapter can add some very useful functionality.

Your job is not to be nice, it’s to win championships and to entertain.
 The National Hockey League has a boring offseason relative to every other major professional sports league, and it’s time for that to be addressed. For entirely too long, the rules and construction of the league have been based upon what makes a general manager’s job easier, more comfortable, and as close to failure-proof as possible. The lack of player mobility via the current restricted free agency system is the epitome of the flaws within the structure of the league’s approach to fan engagement, and it’s largely because GMs care more about playing nice with one another and keeping everyone employed than they do about winning. That needs to change for the sake of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple Watch ECG (electrocardiogram) functionality has received regulatory approval in China, giving Apple the all-clear to launch the feature for Apple Watch users in the country.





According to a new document posted today by China's National Medical Products Administration, Apple has received approval for an ECG. The filing doesn't offer any details about when the feature may launch to Chinese Apple Watch users; however, posts on Chinese social network Weibo, spotted by ITHome, suggest that the feature is already live on the latest watchOS 8 betas. 



With the Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and Series 6, users can take an ECG by placing their finger on the Digital Crown while they wear their watch. The Apple Watch, using an array of onboard sensors, reads the electrical pulses from a wearer's heart. The reading, which can be viewed as a PDF through the Health app on the paired iPhone, can detect if a user's heart is out of rhythm and possibly experiencing atrial fibrillation. 



ECG on the Apple Watch most recently launched in Australia and Vietnam as part of the watchOS 7.4 update.

Loot incentives return for legacy expansions
 Destiny 2’s next update, on July 6, will reissue the remaining 12 legendary weapons from the Forsaken and Shadowkeep expansions, rounding out a promise made earlier this year to return about two dozen weapon and armor sets from their earlier sunsetting.
Nine of the returning weapons can be found on the Moon: Loud Lullaby, One Small Step, Tranquility, Arc Logic, Dream Breaker, Every Waking Moment, Love and Death, A Fine Memorial, and Night Terror. Three more are found in The Dreaming City: Tigerspite, Twilight Oath, and Abide the Return.
“We know that several of these weapons have been popular in the past, looking at you Twilight Oath,” Bungie wrote in a weekly update on Thursday, “and we hope you enjoy getting fresh drops.”
In January, Bungie announced it would walk back some of the weapon sunsetting plans it made in 2020 for Destiny 2. Season 13, which began in February, reissued eight weapons and two armor sets, found in the Dreaming City and Moon locations as well. 
“We are making these changes to help preserve the relevancy of the destinations, specifically some of the pinnacle end-game activities that still exist there,” Bungie said in January. That followed players’ disappointment in the infusion-capping system introduced in Destiny 2: Beyond Light, which removed the loot incentive to play through the Forsaken and Shadowkeep expansions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced the release of the official trailer for the upcoming musical comedy series "Schmigadoon!" ahead of its July 16 premiere on Apple TV+.






A parody of iconic Golden Age musicals, Apple says "Schmigadoon!" stars Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key as a couple on a backpacking trip designed to reinvigorate their relationship who discover a magical town living in a 1940s musical. They then learn that they can't leave until they find "true love." 



Apple says the series has a star-studded cast featuring Strong and Key along with Alan Cumming, Kristin Chenoweth, Aaron Tveit, Dove Cameron, Ariana DeBose, Fred Armisen, Jaime Camil, Jane Krakowski, and Ann Harada.



The first two episodes of the six-episode season will premiere on July 16 on Apple TV+, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday.



In other Apple TV+ news, today marks the premieres of the second season of animated musical comedy "Central Park," the whale documentary "Fathom," and the documentary "Who Are You, Charlie Brown?" narrated by Lupita Nyong'o.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the launch of Apple's new Beats Studio Buds wireless earbuds, with pre-orders beginning to arrive to customers and same-day pickup now available at select Apple Stores in the United States and Canada. Additional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are also selling the earbuds, which come in white, black, and red.





Priced at $149.99, the Beats Studio Buds feature a compact round design without any "stems" dropping below the ears. Like the AirPods Pro, the Beats Studio Buds feature active noise cancellation, and when you need to hear the world around you, you can switch to Transparency mode by pressing and holding the Beats logo button on either earbud.



Apple shared several new Beats Studio Buds support documents today:
Set up and use your Beats Studio Buds


Charge your Beats Studio Buds


Reset your Beats Studio Buds


Beats Studio Buds Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode


If your Beats Studio Buds are lost
While the Beats Studio Buds support one-touch pairing for both Apple and Android devices via Bluetooth, they don't include Apple's H1 or W1 chip, so they're missing some AirPods features like automatic switching between Apple devices.



Other key features of the Beats Studio Buds include up to five hours of listening time per charge with active noise cancellation turned on, hands-free "Hey Siri" support, IPX4-rated sweat and water resistance, Find My support, and a USB-C charging case. To learn more about the Beats Studio Buds, make sure to read our in-depth hands-on review.

Here comes trouble! 
 Do you know axolotls, those salamander-like creatures that live in the water and sometimes have no eyes? They’re in Minecraft now, and the blocky little creatures have set fan communities ablaze with their adorableness.
The creatures were part of the Caves and Cliffs update launched on the Bedrock version of Minecraft on June 8. The update was a hefty one — it brought news blocks, powder snow, and glowing lichen. However, it seems that all the other improvements pale in comparison to the newly added axolotls.
The glittering image of prime evolution, axolotls are amphibians identifiable by their unique external gills that look like feathery appendages on their heads. The Minecraft ones come in all sorts of colors, with some shades and c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has announced its is rolling out Google Fi's built-in VPN service to iPhone subscribers, giving iOS users another way to ensure that their connection is secure and private on a cellular or Wi-Fi network.




Starting today, we're expanding our built-in VPN to ‌iPhone‌®. 🔐
With the Fi VPN, you get a private online connection and more protection from hackers included on all plans. Learn more → https://t.co/TABM9FSYFB pic.twitter.com/WVfTlcpTRO
— Google Fi (@googlefi) June 24, 2021
 


The rollout is a little later than expected, having previously been touted for release in the spring, and Google has said in a tweet that not all ‌iPhone‌ on Google Fi users will have immediate access to the VPN feature. However, the company says it should be widely available "over the coming weeks."



Using the VPN, users can stream, browse, and download over an encrypted, private connection, which is especially important for unsecured public Wi-Fi. As well as encrypting all traffic between a computer and the internet, VPNs also prevent websites from tracking a user's location by masking their IP address.



Google Fi's VPN rollout comes ahead of a new upcoming online privacy feature from Apple called Private Relay. Exclusive to paying iCloud+ subscribers, Private Relay is not being advertised as a VPN by Apple nor is it a like-for-like replacement for one, but it does encrypt Safari browser traffic and uses multiple relay "hops" or proxies to securely route that data and keep it private.

 *The newly-formed NHL franchise in Seattle took a look around the league, at the group of 35 or so men deemed qualified to be an NHL head coach, and said, “It’s Dave Hakstol. Dave Hakstol will lead us.” What a time to be alive. [BSH]
*Dave was in Toronto this season, so here’s what the folks covering them had to say about it. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*Speaking of the Kraken, we’re going to start looking at the players that are most likely to be chosen in the draft, starting with the most obvious choice. [BSH]
*Anyway, the Flyers. The Jack Eichel buzz continues for now. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Shayne Gostisbehere had a good season. A genuinely good season. What does that mean for his future with the Flyers? [The Athletic]
*Let’s take a look at this defensemen-on-the-market situation. There are a lot of options Chuck can go with, which is good. [Inquirer]
*The Flyers will also need a backup goaltender, probably. Some options there as well. [On The Forecheck]
*Next up on our draft board is a kid called Chaz. How could you possibly go wrong with a kid named Chaz? [BSH]
*Rumours abound, friends! And they will for the foreseeable. [Sportsnet]

Currently, apps are limited to the amount of RAM they can use, regardless of the amount available on the device. For example, despite the highest-end M1 iPad Pro featuring 16GB of RAM, on iPadOS 14, apps are limited to only use 5GB. 16GB of RAM is the highest amount of RAM ever offered in an iPhone or iPad, and the 5GB limitation means that apps aren't able to utilize even half of what the iPad Pro has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook has confirmed rumors that it is testing the ability for Instagram users to post to the picture-based social media platform using a web browser on a desktop computer.





With its focus on sharing photos taken with a smartphone camera, Facebook-owned Instagram has long been a mobile-centric social network that lacks many of its basic features in its web browser incarnation, including the ability to post.



In May, the first leaked images of web-based Instagram post creation tools surfaced, showing the ability to natively drag and drop photos and videos from a desktop computer for upload, as well as options to crop the content, apply filters, and compose accompanying text for publishing to feeds.



No official comment was forthcoming that could shed light on what appeared to be early internal testing of the feature. However, following another series of images shared courtesy of social media consultant Matt Navarra, Facebook has now publicly confirmed via Bloomberg that the feature is indeed in the works.

"We know that many people access Instagram from their computer," said Facebook spokeswoman Christine Pai. "To improve that experience, we're now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser."
There's still no word on an official Instagram app built specifically for iPad, but presumably a browser-based way of posting would offer an alternative option for tablet users.

First and foremost, Apple has fixed a long list of bugs in the second betas, as outlined in the release notes. For example, Apple has resolved an issue that caused iCloud Private Relay to function unexpectedly and more. The release notes also indicate the second beta of iPadOS 15 is not available for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (WiFi + Cellular) released in 2015, although Apple did not provide a reason why.



There's a new Apple Maps icon visible in the second betas, with the Interstate 280 shield removed from the bottom-right corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I missed this state-of-the-company update from DuckDuckGo last week:
DuckDuckGrowth over the last 12 months: 50M+ app downloads, 55%
search traffic increase, #2 search engine on mobile in the U.S.,
Canada, Australia, the Netherlands & more.


In the coming weeks, we’re adding new free privacy protections
in beta including a cross-platform email privacy solution & app
tracker blocking on Android devices.


Later this year, we’ll release a beta of the first-ever
DuckDuckGo desktop app, which can be used as a primary browser.


DuckDuckGo has been profitable since 2014 with revenues now
$100M+/yr. In late 2020, we completed a $100M+ mainly secondary
investment from new & existing investors.




#2 search engine on mobile in the U.S. is huge — that would put them ahead of Bing, which comes from a slightly larger company than DuckDuckGo. It also puts them ahead of Yahoo, which was at one time a very well-known company. (I swear that’s true.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Panos Panay, on Microsoft’s Windows Experience Blog:
Windows has always existed to be a stage for the world’s
innovation. It’s been the backbone of global businesses and where
scrappy startups became household names. The web was born and grew
up on Windows. It’s the place where many of us wrote our first
email, played our first PC game and wrote our first line of code.
Windows is the place people go to create, to connect, to learn and
to achieve — a platform over a billion people today rely on.
Some cool-looking stuff, but the devil, as always, is in the details, not the demos. The window tiling features — “Snap Groups” and “Snap Layouts” — in particular look pretty clever. Also, Microsoft is doing something very interesting with app icons — they’re using different shapes for each of them, rather than forcing them all into the exact same roundsquare shape. That’s an idea Apple should copy.
But if you’ll allow me to be persnickety, I’m pretty sure the web wasn’t born on Windows.

Gotta go fast (and get it before July 1)
 Sonic Mania is currently free on the Epic Games Store, and will be available for fans to snag until July 1. The promotion is tied-in with Sonic’s 30th anniversary, which is a pretty impressive run.
Sonic Mania is unique in that it’s a fan-made project that was published by Sega, and the game was well-received. Sonic Mania goes back to the style of the original Genesis platformers without just being a rehash; the game added new mechanics and some impressive level design the original formula. 
It’s a bit of a golden era for Sonic fans. The film Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently in development, and it looks like it’s more focused on Sonic and his world than the real world city of Green Hills. On July 23, the Prague Philarmonic Orchestra performed a symphony concert that included the full range of the Sonic’s series’ jams. Sonic Mania helped usher in a new era for the cool blue hedgehog, so it’s nice to see more people getting a chance to check it out.]]></summary>

SharePlay allows users to share experiences while connecting with friends and family on FaceTime, such as watching an Apple TV+ show in sync. SharePlay is functional in the Apple TV and Apple Music apps as of the second beta of iOS 15.





According to Jordi Bruin, the developer of a new Navi app that will bring subtitles and translation to FaceTime calls, Apple has also started accepting apps that use the GroupActivities framework through App Store Connect, meaning third-party apps offering SharePlay integration will likely be available in beta through TestFlight soon.

As a developer beta, iOS 15 is officially only available to those enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, which costs $99 per year. A free public beta will be available in July, and the software update will be released in the fall.

A mysterious emblem sale started a major debate over the weekend
 Last weekend, Destiny fans erupted in an argument over data-mining and spoilers. What started as the sale of a mysterious emblem quickly turned into players turning on some of the community’s most valuable members: data miners.
Images of a mysterious new emblem called “A Classy Order” started circling around Twitter over the weekend. Destiny community manager Dylan “dmg04” Gafner publicly reached out to “Tryhard ‘Trials Player’ Tristan,” a user sporting the new emblem, to ask how they acquired it. Minutes later, Gafner tweeted a warning to players that started the weekend’s debate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1715, a significant chunk of Rembrandt’s masterpiece The Night Watch, including a 2-foot-wide swath from the left side of the painting, was lopped off in order to fit the painting in a smaller space. (WTF?!) Using a contemporary copy of the full scene painted by Gerrit Lundens and an AI program for getting the colors and angles right, the Rijksmuseum has “restored” The Night Watch, augmenting the painting with digital printouts of the missing bits. The uncropped Rembrandt is shown above and here is Lundens’s version:

I’m not an expert on art, but the 1715 crop and the shift of the principal characters from right-of-center to the center appears to have radically altered the whole feel of the painting.
With the addition especially on the left and the bottom, an empty space is created in the painting where they march towards. When the painting was cut [the lieutenants] were in the centre, but Rembrandt intended them to be off-centre marching towards that empty space, and that is the genius that Rembrandt understands: you create movement, a dynamic of the troops marching towards the left of the painting.

It's best to install iOS 15 and ‌iPadOS 15‌ on a secondary device because this is early release software that could have issues.



Apple has resolved a long list of bugs in the second betas of ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌, according to the release notes. Apple says the second beta of ‌iPadOS 15‌ isn't available for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (WiFi + Cellular) for unspecified reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the second beta coming a little over two weeks after Apple first revealed ‌watchOS 8‌ at the Worldwide Developers Conference.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General > Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It's not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming a little over two weeks after Apple released the first beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 during its keynote event, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there's a new "For All of You" recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound, and if you have HomeKit cameras, you can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.



tvOS 15 is limited to developers at the current time, but Apple will provide a public beta of the software to public beta testers starting in July.

Other notable individuals in attendance included YouTubers such as Justine Ezarik (iJustine), who shared the photos above, and Brian Tong.

Apple Tower Theatre is one of Apple's most significant restoration projects to date. Apple said it collaborated with leading preservationists, restoration artists, and the City of Los Angeles to thoughtfully preserve and restore the theater, which was designed in 1927 by renowned motion-picture theater architect S. Charles Lee.



Apple Tower Theatre will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday, and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday.

And yes, the songs are all in Simlish
 The Sims 4 players will get a new stage to explore this summer, with an in-game musical event called Sims Sessions. Sims Sessions will run from June 26 through July 7, and includes artists like Bebe Rexha, Glass Animals lead singer Dave Bayley, and singer and songwriter Joy Oladokun.
The Sims franchise has a long history of collaborating with artists to bring their music into the game. Notably, every song has to be changed, because in the Sims everyone speaks Simlish — even the celebrity cameos. While songs are often used for promotional purposes, Sims Sessions will have them be integrated into the game world.
Players can dress their Sims up, head down to the concert, and pick up exclusive digital merchandise from the performers. Once the show is done, they can take to the stage themselves to play some sick tunes. Or, if you’re not interested in that much attention, Sims can sneak off to WooHoo in the tents.
There’s even a tie-in TikTok challenge called #SimlishSessions, where players can sing the single Sabotage in Simlish. It’s a good time to learn the difference between “yabahorne” and “yim bala.”
The Sims 4 will be on sale leading up to Sims Sessions from June 24-29. Players don’t need any expansions in order to visit the Sims Sessions event in-game.]]></summary>

It’s all about looks.
 I am going to made it really clear, before anything else is said, that I am not a professional scout, or even someone that evaluates hockey players on a serious level. I wouldn’t take my opinion of a player and run with it, making it the concrete fact or something to base your opinion on. Even still, there’s a clear problem with how people and those people that are in power to make organizational decisions, evaluate and judge hockey players on the ice.

They’re gazing at Alex Morgan from the U.S. Women’s National Team, soaring high over Hall-of-Famer Wayne Gretzky. Neither one plays basketball, but she’s about to jam one in the Great One’s face.
Freidlin, chief executive of Bit Fry Game Studios, doesn’t deny that inking 60 all-stars from five sports to a licensing deal for a mobile video game is a hell of a head-turner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following his company's reveal of Windows 11, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern to discuss the next generation of Windows and the possibility of Apple bringing some of its services, such as iMessage, to Windows. 





One major theme of Windows 11 is its openness to third-party app marketplaces and Microsoft's end goal of making the platform a center of creativity outside the bounds of its own Microsoft App Store. Windows 11 will allow users to run Android apps, but the integration with Windows and iPhone is lacking. In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would "love to make sure that it works better," referencing the iPhone and Windows. 



The CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive. 



As part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives revealed that at one point in time, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android. 



According to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform "would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones." While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage.

 Windows 11, the next version of Microsoft’s operating system, will offer a number of features targeted toward PC gamers, led by Xbox Game Pass directly within Windows’ new Xbox app, Microsoft announced Thursday during its Windows 11 reveal event.
Presenting Windows 11 as “the best Windows ever for gaming,” Sarah Bond, Xbox corporate vice president for game creator experience and ecosystem, appeared on Microsoft’s livestream to announce that Xbox Game Pass will be “built right into Windows 11.” Microsoft has been testing this functionality for many months with a redesigned Xbox app for Windows 10, but clips of the Windows 11 version that Bond showed seemed to indicate a deeper integration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft today held an event where it unveiled Windows 11, the next generation of Windows with a new design, new versatility capabilities, gaming improvements, and more. One notable announcement was that, starting with Windows 11, PCs will be able to run Android apps. 





Logically, Microsoft would partner with the Google Play Store to offer Android apps on its platforms. However, the company is taking a different route, partnering with Amazon to open Windows 11 to Android apps. As reported by The Verge, users will search for an Android app offered through the Amazon app marketplace directly within the newly redesigned Microsoft App Store. 





Android apps will run on the platform using Intel's "bridge technology." Like traditional Windows apps, Android apps can be added to the new centered Windows taskbar, pinned, and snapped to different multitasking modes. Specific details remain unknown, such as hardware requirements and developers' need to make their Android apps runnable on Windows 11. 



Microsoft's announcement draws comparisons to Apple's announcement with macOS Big Sur last year and its transition to Apple silicon. Thanks to Apple silicon and the common architecture shared among Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, macOS can now run ‌iPhone‌ apps. 



Despite Apple's best intentions, the experience of running iOS apps on Apple silicon Macs has been rough due to Mac's input being fully trackpad and keyboard-based, compared to the direct touch experience the apps were initially designed for. Apple has attempted to solve the issue by introducing touch alternatives, which turn the Mac trackpad into a "virtual touch screen."

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles arrives in October
 The Demon Slayer video game, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, is coming to North America and Europe this October, thanks to publisher Sega. Developed by CyberConnect2, the video game based on the popular Demon Slayer anime will be released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
CyberConnect2 is best known for its work on anime-inspired fare like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot and the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja and .hack games. The studio’s take on Demon Slayer looks on par with its brand of cel-shaded arena-based fighting and interactive storytelling. The Hinokami Chronicles will retell the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc and Mugen Train Arc from Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles will feature voice work from the original English- and Japanese-language cast. Here’s the game’s official description:
It is the Taisho Period in Japan. Tanjiro, a kindhearted boy who sells charcoal for a living, finds his family slaughtered by a demon. To make matters worse, his younger sister Nezuko, the sole survivor, has been transformed into a demon herself. Though devastated by this grim reality, Tanjiro resolves to become a “demon slayer” so that he can turn his sister back into a human and kill the demon that massacred his family.

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles will arrive Oct. 15.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple may have tested "Smart Bands" for the Apple Watch, according to a new image of a prototype device.





The image, shared by developer and prototype collector Giulio Zompetti, shows two metal contacts inside an Apple Watch Series 3 prototype's band slot, either side of the diagnostic port. Zompetti postulated that the "two unusual pads are exposed to the band," and may be a kind of iPad-like "Smart Connector," much like those from various iPad models, used to accommodate a "Smart Band."



Apple has filed a large number of patents around smart Apple Watch bands, indicating that it is something that the company has actively considered. Some patents showed how features such as biometric authentication, self-tightening, and LED progress indicators could be integrated into a band, while others explained a modular approach with batteries, displays, cameras, blood pressure sensors, and more.



The Apple Watch's hidden diagnostic port was once speculated to facilitate Smart Bands. At the time, the diagnostic connector, which is purportedly based on the design of the Lightning connector, was said to be capable of supporting future accessories.



Third-party accessory makers were able to develop an external battery band that could charge the Apple Watch through the diagnostic port, but changes to the Apple Watch's software prevented the strap from ever coming to market. However, other smart bands not reliant on the diagnostic port have become available in recent years.



In the past, Zompetti has shared images of prototype versions of the original Apple Watch, first-generation iPad, third-generation iPod touch, and iPhone 12 Pro.

The ultra-offensive forward is next on our board.
 Chaz Lucius can potentially be a mid-first round steal. The electric forward missed a significant amount of time due to multiple injuries — whether it was recovering from surgery or getting sick before the Under-18 Worlds — but when he was healthy, he put on a clinic on how to score heaps and piles and heaps of goals.
A mid-sized center that just gets to the front of his opponent’s net and makes their goaltender have a miserable time, he is able to get his shots off in that dangerous area and just simply produces from that spot on the ice. Every team needs to have a pigeon and Lucius can potentially be one of the best at the top level at shoveling pucks into the back of the net.
He’s a unique player and one that will …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Postal Service has released a set of Sun Science stamps that use images from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory to illustrate different solar phenomena like plasma blasts, sunspots, and solar flares.
Printed with a foil treatment that adds a glimmer to the stamps, the images on these stamps come from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, a spacecraft launched in February 2010 to keep a constant watch on the sun from geosynchronous orbit above Earth. The striking colors in these images do not represent the actual colors of the sun as perceived by human eyesight. Instead, each image is colorized by NASA according to different wavelengths that reveal or highlight specific features of the sun’s activity.
One of the stamps highlights sunspots, two feature images of coronal holes, two show coronal loops, two depict plasma blasts, one is a view of an active sun that emphasizes its magnetic fields, and two show different views of a solar flare.


NASA has more on the science behind the images on the stamps and the whole set of stamps are available for purchase online.

As noted by 9to5Mac's Michael Steeber, June 15 marked the first day that all Apple Store locations were open around the world, as public health restrictions begin to ease in many countries. O'Brien confirmed that all Apple Store locations are now open, adding that more people are getting out and about as life returns to a more familiar state.



O'Brien does not anticipate a "major shift" in operations moving forward, but Apple does continue to offer customers one-on-one shopping sessions with a Specialist as well as Genius Bar reservations at many locations. The retail chief expects Apple Stores to remain a "hub of activity" with free "Today at Apple" creative sessions and more.



Apple has over 500 stores around the world, including a new Tower Theatre location in Downtown Los Angeles that opens today.

Could the Flyers lose one of their most productive forwards from 2021 in the expansion draft?
 As the Flyers prepare for the offseason to get busy, they are now officially less than a month away from the summer’s first major off-ice event: the Seattle Kraken’s Expansion Draft. Set to take place on July 21, the NHL’s 32nd team will select its initial roster like Vegas did four years earlier.
For an initial read on the rules for Seattle’s draft, and how the Flyers should be prepared to handle it, you can read this from March of last year. Shockingly little has changed in terms of the Flyers’ expansion outlook since then, other than the fact that Scott Laughton’s contract extension makes him a likely protected piece for the Flyers and as such takes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highly reliable Apple leaker known as "Kang" and a number of other unspecified leakers have reportedly received warnings from lawyers representing Apple.





According to posts on Kang's Weibo account, Apple recently commissioned a law firm to send admonitory letters to a number of leakers.



The letter purportedly cautioned leakers that they must not disclose information about unreleased Apple projects because it may give Apple's competitors valuable information and "mislead customers, because what is disclosed may not be accurate."



Apple purportedly grabbed screenshots of Kang's Weibo as evidence, which included him talking about problems he experienced with the iPhone, product release dates, and purchase suggestions for his followers, as well as more casual posts.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.K. mobile operator EE plans to charge customers almost $3 (£2) a day to use data roaming within the EU, a result of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, BBC reports.





The new charge will go into effect in January 2022, and at first, will only apply to new EE customers or customers upgrading their plan and contract from July 7, 2021. Initially, EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone, representing the largest mobile operators in the U.K., stated they had no plans to reintroduce the charge. EE has, however, changed its mind and claims the new charge will "support investment." 

Mobile networks in EU countries are not allowed to charge customers extra to use their phones in other EU countries, within fair use limits.



EE, O2, Three and Vodafone had all stated they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges, despite Brexit giving them the option to do so.



EE said the charges would "support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network". However, it will not charge UK customers extra to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland.
Mobile operator O2 also says it plans to reintroduce the roaming charges, but notes that it is adding a "fair use" data limit of 25GB a month, and "will not charge customers more to use their phones in the EU," according to BBC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Zoom added support for the new Center Stage feature exclusive to Apple's latest iPad Pro models, and this month the popular video conferencing app is back with another update containing several interface improvements and usability features on iOS.





Notable enhancements in version 5.7.0 of the app include a better iPad "visual experience", support for individual call participants to request Live Transcription, custom video filters, scheduling privileges, consistent date formatting, and pairing with Zoom Rooms on the Zoom desktop client.



In addition, there's enhanced data privacy notifications for chat channels with enhanced chat encryption, the ability to display several phone numbers in user contact cards, and enhancements to the invite by phone option.



This update also introduces a new field for gender pronouns, along with options to choose when they're displayed. Pronouns appear in parentheses next to people's names during a call, as well as under names on user profile cards. 



Users can also choose if they want their pronoun to be shared in meetings and in webinars. The new profile settings let users "always share" (the default), "do not share," or "ask me every time" if pronouns should be displayed in each meeting. 



Version 5.7.0 of Zoom for iOS is available on the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has updated its 2FA Authenticator app for iOS with a new privacy feature that lets users require Face ID or Touch ID before displaying two-factor account authentication codes.





Previously, fingerprint or facial authentication was only required when exporting accounts. Now though, upon activating Google's Privacy Screen feature in v3.2.0 of the app, Face ID or ‌Touch ID‌ is needed in order to show newly generated codes. 



The authentication requirement can be set to show immediately, after 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes. In addition, Google has added a search bar to the top of the app interface to let users search for accounts. 



Google Authenticator's previous update introduced a dark mode and the aforementioned account transfer feature. However, the latest improvements are likely to be seen by many Apple device users as verging on the redundant, following the news earlier this month that iOS 15 will include a built-in password authenticator.



When Apple releases ‌iOS 15‌ in the fall, iPhone and iPad users will be able to natively generate 2FA verification codes for additional sign-in security, so there will be no need for a separate app. 



Apple says that you'll be able to set up verification codes under Passwords in the Settings app. And once set up, the codes will autofill when you sign into a site, making the use of two-factor authentication a more streamlined experience than using a third-party method. This feature will be available on ‌‌iOS 15‌‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech has launched a version of its Combo Touch Keyboard for Apple's 4th-generation iPad Air, offering a more affordable alternative to Apple's Magic Keyboard. 





Priced at $199.99, which is $100 cheaper than the Magic Keyboard for the 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌, Logitech's Combo Touch Keyboard provides a full folio case with attached keyboard and touchpad.



Like the version already available for Apple's latest iPad Pro models, the keyboard is detachable and an integrated stand allows it to be used in various typing, viewing, sketching, and reading modes. 



It connects to an ‌‌iPad Air‌‌ using the Smart Connector, so there's no need for pairing or charging a battery. It also features backlit keys, iPadOS shortcut keys, and space at the top for storing and charging an Apple Pencil (2nd generation), which attaches magnetically to the iPad.



Logitech's Combo Touch for the 4th-gen iPar Air comes in gray, and the company is also now offering a new "sand" color option for the iPad Pro (5th gen) version of the keyboard case. 



The Logitech Combo Touch for the 4th-gen ‌iPad Air‌ and the new color for the ‌iPad Pro‌ version are available to pre-order from the Logitech website. Both products start shipping next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you run across an aspect of reality and it just completely blows your mind. You’ve heard of dark matter, right? Well, meet dark fish: biologists suspect that up to 95% of the world’s total fish population lives in a deep layer of the ocean that is difficult to detect and we know little about.
An international team of marine biologists has found mesopelagic fish in the earth’s oceans constitute 10 to 30 times more biomass than previously thought.
UWA Professor Carlos Duarte says mesopelagic fish — fish that live between 100 and 1000m below the surface — must therefore constitute 95 per cent of the world’s fish biomass.
“Because the stock is much larger it means this layer must play a more significant role in the functioning of the ocean and affecting the flow of carbon and oxygen in the ocean,” he says.


See also this thread from ocean scientist Andrew Thaler:
There’s a globe-spanning layer of mesopelagic fish that is so dense it distorts SONAR. For decades we had no idea what created the Deep Scattering Layer or why it moved. We still know almost nothing about it.


It’s astounding how much we don’t know about the ocean:
There’s an entire family of whales with at least 22 species that we know almost nothing about.


We know way more about stars that are billions of light years away than about some parts of the ocean a few hundred feet below the surface of our own planet.
See also dark fungi: “By one estimate, there are between 2.2 million and 3.8 million species of fungi — and more than 90% of them aren’t cataloged.”. (via @_zeets & @chadmumm)

Despite a major transformation to Destiny’s social space, everything remains business as usual
 Destiny 2’s Tower got engulfed in a darkness called the Endless Night at the start of Season of the Splicer. But with the weekly reset on June 22, things got considerably worse. The main Tower plaza is now infested with Taken Blight and goop. But the civilians of the Tower, even characters like Commander Zavala or Lord Shaxx, have nothing to say about it. 
When I first landed in the Tower this week, the change was obvious. There’s a giant Taken ball floating in-between the walkways in the Courtyard — you can actually stand on it for a great view of the the Traveler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple subsidiary Claris today announced the release of FileMaker version 19.3 with several new features, including native support for Apple silicon, resulting in improved performance on Macs with the M1 chip.





An overview of new features from the announcement:
• Apple silicon: Claris FileMaker Pro and Claris FileMaker Server are the first low-code universal macOS binaries that ensure optimized performance on Apple silicon computers while still offering amazing speed on Intel-based Mac computers.

• Microsoft Edge for Windows: The latest Microsoft Edge WebView2 control replaces Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), which eliminates potential security concerns and ensures full FileMaker extensibility on Windows.

• Significant server enhancements: Introducing Ubuntu, the most popular Linux distribution worldwide; the return of an enhanced log viewer; and many more server fixes and under-the-hood functionality that boost performance, flexibility, stability, and security.
Popular note-taking app Notability was also updated today with native support for Apple silicon, resulting in up to 50% faster performance when running the app on an M1 Mac compared to an Intel-based Mac. Notability enables users to create hand-written digital notes with audio, which is handy for lectures and more.



Current users of Notability on the iPad can download the Mac version for free on the Mac App Store. New users can purchase Notability for $8.99, and use Notability across their Mac, iPad, and iPhone with a single purchase.

Heather drove me to the endoscopy centre, where the AirPod was got
back out via my mouth using a tube with a lasso attachment. It was
extremely uncomfortable, but I was sedated and so only half awake.
A few minutes later, I was given the AirPod in a neat little bag.
I tried it as soon as I got home. It works fine, although the
microphone is less reliable than it was. I’ll never know for
certain how I managed to swallow it; my theory is that it dropped
on to the pillow, ended up next to my mouth and got sucked in when
I yawned. In retrospect, I’m glad the “find my AirPod” attempt
didn’t work — I would have freaked out if my throat had beeped.
Takes (more than) a licking, keeps on ticking.

"Suppliers including Semco, LG Innotek, Kinsus, Unimicron, Nan Ya, Zhen Ding and AT&S have all kicked off their BT substrate shipments for Apple's next-generation products including the Apple Watch, AirPods and iPhone, which all adopt SiP modules," a paywalled DigiTimes report claimed today, citing industry sources.



Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu previously reported that the third-generation AirPods will be released later in 2021 with a similar design as the AirPods Pro, including shorter stems. This would mark the first update to the standard AirPods since March 2019, when the second-generation pair launched with the H1 chip for hands-free "Hey Siri" functionality and up to 50 percent more talk time than the original AirPods.



The second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case, and the third-generation AirPods would maintain a lower price than the AirPods Pro, which cost $249 regularly but are frequently on sale. It's likely that the third-generation AirPods will lack some higher-end features like active noise cancellation to maintain this lower price point.



As for the AirPods Pro, a second-generation pair with fitness tracking are rumored to launch next year, and they may have a more compact design similar to Apple's new Beats Studio Buds released earlier this month.

I created Newsstand as a fun way to access the news on my vintage
Macs. I have a two Apple PowerBook G3 computers, but older
machines don’t work very well on the modern web. Their browsers
can’t load https websites, and vintage hardware can’t keep up with
the dynamic pages that make up the web today. I created Newsstand
in Mac OS 9 using tools only available at the time.
He even made the website on Mac OS 9.
As a sidenote, this is the best new app icon I’ve seen in years. Newsstand’s exquisite 3D icon is a jarring reminder of just how boring today’s flat icon aesthetic is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new version of the 1.0.276 firmware designed for AirTags, which is a revision to the update that was made available in June.





The new ‌AirTags‌ 1.0.276 firmware has a build number of 1A287b, while the old firmware had a build number of 1A276d. The 1.0.276 firmware that came out in June added anti-stalking security enhancements, and this new version likely just refines these features.



Because the firmware version has not changed, it is not possible to tell the new firmware from the old firmware in the Find My app, nor will it be apparent when the firmware of the ‌AirTags‌ has been updated.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, because it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌iPhone‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the Find My app.

The six-part docuseries will examine "sound creation and the revolutionary technology that has shaped music as we know it," and as the name suggests, it is hosted by DJ and Grammy Award-winning artist and producer Mark Ronson.



Each episode will follow Ronson as he uncovers untold stories of music creation and explores the lengths that producers and creators will go to in order to find the perfect sound.
Ronson explores music's intersection with artistry and technology in candid conversations with music legends and icons including Paul McCartney, Questlove, King Princess, Dave Grohl, Adrock and Mike D from the Beastie Boys, Charli XCX and more, where he discovers the ways in which these unique tools have influenced their work.
The end of each episode will feature Ronson creating a unique piece of original music using different techniques like reverb, synth, autotune, drum machines, sampling, and distortion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 could feature a smaller "S7" chip, potentially providing more space for a larger battery or other components.





According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report accessed by MacRumors, next-generation Apple Watch models will adopt double-sided System in Package (SiP) packaging from Taiwanese supplier ASE Technology.



On its website, ASE Technology confirms that its double-sided technology allows for module miniaturization, paving the way for a smaller "S7" chip.



Apple Watch Series 7 models are expected to be released in September, in line with the past several generations of the device. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu previously reported that Apple has tested thinner display bezels and a new lamination technique that brings the display closer to the front cover. The next Apple Watch could also feature a new flat-edged design and a new green color option, according to leaker Jon Prosser.



Advanced health features like body temperature sensing and blood glucose monitoring have also been rumored for a future Apple Watch, but these features are considered unlikely to be ready for Series 7 models this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is planning to launch an updated version in the first half of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a note to investors.





As he has said previously, the design of the new iPhone SE will be "roughly the same" as the existing SE, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.



Kuo says that the new 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌ will support 5G, and it will include processor updates. The device will be positioned as the "cheapest 5G iPhone ever." The most affordable ‌iPhone‌ with 5G right now is the iPhone 12 mini, so presumably the ‌iPhone SE‌ will be a good deal more affordable than the $699 price point of that device.



There have been rumors of an "‌iPhone SE‌ Plus" with a larger display and a Touch ID power button, which Kuo has also mentioned in the past, but there's no word of this bigger ‌iPhone SE‌ in Kuo's note and we haven't heard new details about it for some time, so it is not clear if it's been scrapped or is something that's coming at a later date.



Kuo also previously said that Apple is developing a new version of the iPhone 11 with a 6-inch LCD, Face ID support, and 5G, and it's possible thst this future device, which is said to be launching in 2023, will also be in the SE family.



There is no specific word on when we can expect the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, but the first half of 2022 perhaps suggests a spring event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple may include an under the screen Touch ID sensor for some models of the 2022 iPhones, according to credible Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.





In an investor note today obtained by MacRumors, Kuo says that Apple plans to have four models in the 2022 iPhone lineup. Kuo had previously stated that the iPhone 13, destined for this year, will be the last iPhone lineup to feature a 5.4-inch “mini” size. Kuo reaffirmed his belief today, stating that the 2022 iPhones will only feature a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch size, with two models of each size.



The low-end 6.7-inch iPhone may cost less than $900 but could lack certain features such as an under the screen Touch ID sensor to compensate for costs. The current largest 6.7-inch iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, begins at $1,099.



Providing some details about the camera improvements coming to the 2022 iPhones, Kuo says the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones will feature an improved wide-angle camera with 48 megapixels.



In the same note, Kuo reiterated that in the first half of next year, Apple is still planning to launch an updated iPhone SE that will be the “cheapest 5G iPhone ever.” The update to the iPhone SE will feature a similar design as the current model, with improved performance.

Aliens: Fireteam is now Aliens: Fireteam Elite
 The three-player cooperative survival shooter set in the Alien universe, Aliens: Fireteam Elite, will arrive Aug. 24, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. 20th Century Games and Cold Iron Studios announced the release date for Aliens: Fireteam Elite on Wednesday, also revealing the game’s adjusted name (it was previously known as just Aliens: Fireteam).
The game costs $39.99 and offers four story-driven campaigns and customizable Colonial Marines. A deluxe edition of Aliens: Fireteam Elite will cost $69.99, and includes four cosmetic DLC bundles that will include class kit skins, weapon colors, and head accessories, as part of the game’s Endeavor Pass. The Endeavor Veteran Pack includes even more cosmetic items, and is included with the deluxe edition. The publisher also promises “free major gameplay updates.”
Players who pre-order Aliens: Fireteam Elite will get the Hardened Marine Pack, which includes additional cosmetics, including the “Chestburster” emote and a bandana that will complete your Private Vasquez look.
Aliens: Fireteam Elite sends teams of three Colonial Marines on a variety of interstellar bug hunts where they’ll face Xenomorphs of all stripes, deadly Weyland-Yutani synthetics, and other threats on far-off planets. Players must team up and strategize to take on waves of enemies, Left 4 Dead style, employing tactical roles and customizable soldiers.

Serious fun with room for silliness among friends, too
 Olympics video games of the non-Mario-&-Sonic type have had a negligible appeal over the past, oh, IV or V Olympiads. The format itself — dividing players’ attention among several events instead of focusing on one — presents a big challenge to developers. And the fact that TV coverage fixates more on athletes and their stories than the events or their results certainly does not help set players’ expectations.

The game takes place in a fictional country called New Himuka that has been invaded by dangerous creatures called Others. These creatures fall from the sky, part of a phenomenon called the Extinction Belt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an email informing Apple TV+ subscribers that their free trial period will soon lapse, Apple also revealed that the series "Foundation" and "The Problem With Jon Stewart" will both premiere in September, but no specific dates were provided.





From the email, received by a MacRumors editor:
Plus, there's much more to come with highly anticipated new dramas, comedies, kids shows and some of the biggest films in streaming:



- Mr. Corman: Starring Emmy Award® winner Joseph Gordon-Levitt — series premieres August 6

- CODA: Sundance Film Festival award winner — film premieres August 13

- Foundation: Based on Isaac Asimov's award-winning novels — series premieres in September

- The Problem With Jon Stewart: The late-night star's long-awaited return to TV — series premieres in September

- The Shrink Next Door: Starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd — series premieres November 12
The release dates for the other ‌Apple TV+‌ series in the list were previously known.



Based on the award-winning novels by Isaac Asimov, Apple said "Foundation" will chronicle a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.






"The Problem With Jon Stewart" will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation, according to Apple. The new, original current affairs series will mark Stewart's return to television after his 20-time Emmy Award-winning run on the Comedy Central series "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" came to a close in 2015.



For many ‌Apple TV+‌ users, expect your subscription to automatically renew for the standard $4.99 per month starting July 1. This date may vary slightly for some users depending on the date that you first subscribed to the service.



(Thanks, Zach Knox!)

More data, hot off the presses!
 It isn’t an exaggeration to say that Cam York was a real breath of air for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms when he finally made his professional debut back in April. His impacts at 5-on-5 were pretty immediately felt, between playmaking and puck moving, adding an extra bit of dynamic skill to a team already pretty well stocked with it. 
But while those impacts have been well documented and discussed, we (or me, maybe it was just me) couldn’t shake the feeling that where York gave the team a real boost was on the power play, but we didn’t really have the same wealth of data as we do at 5-on-5 to confirm or deny that. Well, until now!
We’re here today, with data in hand, to have a look back at York’s eight games on the power play…]]></summary>

“When you talk to kids here at Rockaway, they think of a surfer as John John Florence — blonde,” says Harris. “When I say, ‘Hey, I’m a surfer,’ they’re shocked. We’re trying to reach every kid, but we’re really trying to reach the kids that wouldn’t otherwise get the opportunity.
We just want to keep kids busy and active, and spread the message and spread the stoke of surfing, and go into schools and talk to kids about water safety.”
“There’s no racism out there”, says Harris of the ocean. “When you come out of that water, of course you go back to your life. But you lose yourself when you get into the waves.”

The son of a former Flyer!
 Continuing on with the theme of players who had to switch leagues due to COVID cancellations, we have Cole Sillinger. Unfortunately, similarly to the OHL, the WHL also had its season suspended, and as a result, Sillinger opted to play in the USHL this season instead of with the Medicine Hat Tigers (amazing team name). 
Sillinger is a very interesting player for a couple of reasons. First, he is the son of former NHLer and first round pick Mike Sillinger, who played primarily with the Red Wings and Islanders, though he did have a stint as a Flyer from 1997 to 1999! Second, and more importantly, he is a consistent scorer from his center position, and can also play on the left wing. He managed 20+ goals in the WHL in 2019-20, as well as i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American Airlines plans to roll out new iPhones and iPads to pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, and aircraft maintenance technicians over the next year, according to a company memo obtained by View from the Wing. 





The airline started rolling out the iPhone 12 to its gate agents at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, allowing agents to offer service to customers wherever they are in a terminal, per the memo. If the test program is successful, the iPhone 12 will be rolled out to all of the airline's agents over the next year. 



American Airlines maintenance technicians have started receiving the seventh-generation iPad, the memo added. Once that rollout is complete by the end of June, they will no longer need to carry two different tablets for different aircraft and activities.



American Airlines pilots will continue to use iPads. The airline recently added a real-time weather app and a new turbulence awareness app to the devices.



Starting in the first quarter of 2022, American Airlines flight attendants will receive an iPhone 12 for customer service and flight management purposes, according to the memo. The new iPhones will have a customized attachment that will accept multiple forms of payment for in-flight purchases, including contactless payments like Apple Pay.

Now, the company is continuing its PR push, with an executive noting in an interview that users who wish to sideload apps already have that option thanks to other platforms.





Speaking to Fast Company, Apple's head of user privacy, Erik Neuenschwander, said that opening the doors to sideloading apps on ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌, which would enable users to download apps from the web and other app marketplaces besides Apple's App Store, could lead users to be "tricked or duped" into "some dark alley."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New alleged dummy models of the upcoming iPhone 13, shared by leaker Sonny Dickson on Twitter, depict a modified camera layout on the standard ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, with two lenses in a diagonal arrangement rather than the vertical arrangement seen on the iPhone 12 models.





The dummy models generally line up with ‌iPhone 13‌ schematics previously seen by MacRumors, which showed that the upcoming iPhones will feature a thicker overall design and a larger camera bump on the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro to more closely match its larger sibling.



The larger and thicker camera bumps could be a result of the rumored inclusion of sensor-shift stabilization for the entire lineup. The highest-end Pro and Pro Max are also rumored to feature upgraded Ultra Wide cameras. 






Beyond camera improvements, the upcoming ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and Pro Max are expected to come with a 120Hz display and potentially always-on capabilities. Recently leaked battery capacities suggest that the entire lineup will feature larger batteries, possibly due in part to the higher power consumption needed for the higher variable refresh rate on the Pro models. 



Unlike last year, Apple is expected to launch the new iPhones in September, in line with years prior to the global health crisis. Apple recently filed upcoming models of the iPhone into the EEC database, and Apple's suppliers are beginning to ramp up efforts to improve device production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OneDrive users can now edit pictures after they've uploaded them to the cloud storage service, thanks to the addition of basic photo editing features announced this week by Microsoft.





Similar to tools found in Google Photos, the new features include standard cropping options with built-in presets for images to be used on social media, as well as flip and 90-degree and incremental rotate options for uploaded pictures.



There are some useful new light and color adjustments, too. Users can adjust brightness, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and color saturation, with a before/after comparison option to check your edits. 



When you make edits to photos on OneDrive, you'll get the option to save the changes as a new image or overwrite the original image. And if you accidentally overwrite your original, you can use version history to recover it. Photo editing in OneDrive is currently limited to JPEG and PNG formats.



The new image editing features are now rolling out to OneDrive for Web and OneDrive for Android, with Microsoft bringing them to OneDrive for iOS later this year.

A new "Instagram Stories" option will appear for iOS users within the Twitter share sheet for a specific tweet. By pressing it, users are redirected to Instagram Stories with an unclickable sticker of that specific tweet. While the new method is useful for users, its limitation of not linking to the specific tweet makes the true cross-platform sharing experience a continued annoyance for users.




Skip the screenshots –– sharing Tweets to Instagram Stories right from the share menu is now rolling out to everyone on iOS!
Tap the share icon on a Tweet and select “Instagram Stories”. Once your Instagram app opens, you can resize/reposition the Tweet sticker before posting. https://t.co/R1qayqMwYl pic.twitter.com/yp82IH5Tuk
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) June 22, 2021
 


Twitter began testing the new option with a select number of iOS users in December and it's now available to all iOS users. Twitter has not yet commented on when the new feature will be available for Android users.

In a new document shared on its privacy website, Apple said the App Store plays an important role in keeping users safe, as the company reviews all apps and app updates submitted to ensure they are free of inappropriate content, privacy invasions, known malware, or other violations of the App Store Review Guidelines.

Ministers at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport today announced that they will consult on plans to bring streaming video platforms under British broadcasting laws in order to level the regulatory playing field with traditional broadcasters like the BBC, ITV, Sky and others.



Traditional broadcasters like the BBC and ITV must comply with regulator Ofcom's code, which covers issues including harm, offense, accuracy, and impartiality. If the rules of the code are broken, Ofcom can dole out fines and suspend licenses.

Grinding out Monster Hunter Stories 2 makes for a chill weekend
 Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin manages to pack all the odd quirks from the Monster Hunter series into a Pokémon-like turn-based RPG for Nintendo Switch and PC. It’s a bizarre combination, but it works. 
I played the first few hours of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruins on Switch using a code from Capcom. But despite the game’s focus on story, the grind of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin has been the most compelling and gripping aspect for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week announced that, to date, Apple TV+ films and series have received 389 awards nominations and have won 112 awards since the streaming service launched in November 2019. The company said Apple TV+ has "received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service in its debut."





Recent award wins for Apple TV+ include hit comedy series "Ted Lasso" receiving a Peabody Award for excellence in storytelling, while Apple also earned two Critics Choice Real TV Awards for Oprah Winfrey's talk series "The Oprah Conversation" and the musician docuseries "1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything."



Rival streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ do not appear to have readily available awards statistics for comparison, but Netflix secured a record-breaking 160 Emmy Awards nominations in 2020 alone, compared to 18 for Apple TV+. Netflix has been streaming original content since 2013, however, giving it a six year lead on Apple TV+.



Apple TV+ has more original content coming over the next several months:
"Central Park" animated musical comedy series: season two premieres June 25


"Ted Lasso" comedy series: season two premieres July 23


"Truth Be Told" anthology drama series: season two premieres August 20


"See" sci-fi drama series: season two premieres August 27


"The Morning Show" drama series: season two premieres September 17


"Invasion" sci-fi thriller series: premieres October 22


"The Shrink Next Door" dark comedy series: premieres November 12
Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial available to all users. Apple TV+ is also included free for one year when you purchase and activate a qualifying Apple device through June 30, 2021 — it's dropping to three months after this date.

Sega’s Master System mascot gets a makeover, but not much else
 The latest revival of a vintage Sega game that’s not made by Sega itself is Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX, a remaster of the 8-bit platformer that launched on the Sega Master System. Developed by Jankenteam and originally created as a fan project, the officially sanctioned remaster is a handsome visual update that does little else to modernize Alex Kidd’s 35-year-old adventure.
Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX plays nearly identically to its 1986 counterpart, largely for the worse. The developers, who clearly love Alex Kidd, have only slightly modified how Sega’s former mascot controls. Many of the changes are superficial or minor interface changes; it’s easier to use Alex’s power ups,…]]></summary>

The awkwardly named WF-1000XM4 buds are priced at $279, just a bit higher than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ at $249, although we've been regularly seeing discounted pricing on ‌AirPods Pro‌ in the $200 range (including $189.99 for Prime Day), so that's one factor in favor of the ‌AirPods Pro‌, at least for now.

Over six weeks in the summer of 1969, all of these legendary artists (and more!) performed at the Harlem Cultural Festival in NYC, drawing an estimated 300,000 people. The festival was filmed and broadcast on a local TV station, but the footage was never commercially released and so unlike that other 1969 festival, this event largely slipped from public memory.
Now, the Harlem Cultural Festival finally gets its due in the form of Summer of Soul, a forthcoming documentary directed by Questlove that uses that old footage to great effect. I’ve heard nothing but good things about this movie — it won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Summer of Soul is out in theaters and on Hulu July 2.

 With big-budget, pre-rendered cinematics and a narrator after Sam Elliott’s own heart, Focus Home Interactive wants you to know that Farming Simulator 22 is officially not, uh, farmin’ around when it lands on your harvest table this Thanksgiving.
We’ve gotta hand it to them, and developers Giants Software, and whoever directed this. If the match cut of a truck bedliner’s grooves to the 24 earthen lines carved by a New Holland disc harrow doesn’t get you fired up to put some wheat in the ground, then perhaps nothing will.
And perhaps nothing will, if you’re the soft-hands type whose Novembers are spent on Call of Duty instead of doing real virtual work. Or virtual real work. Whatever, snowflake, Farming Simulator 22 dispenses wisdom, not Pez.
Speaking of wisdom, the man quoted in the opening of the trailer was Mohandas K. Gandhi. And Farming Simulator 22 will find the divinity within you on Nov. 22, 2021 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

 AMD’s new foray into the field of image enhancement technologies is now available, providing PC gamers with an open-source alternative to options like Nvidia’s well-regarded Deep Learning Super Sampling.
First teased last fall during the announcement of the Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards, AMD’s technology is called FidelityFX Super Resolution. The goal of these kinds of techniques is to improve performance (i.e., frame rate) by rendering a game at a lower internal resolution and then upscaling that original image to a higher output resolution — without sacrificing image qua…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-06-22T19:10:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brave:
Brave Search is available in beta release globally on all Brave
browsers (desktop, Android, and iOS) as one of the search options
alongside other search engines, and will become the default search
in the Brave browser later this year. It is also available from
any other browser at search.brave.com. […]
Brave Search is different from other search engines because it
uses its own index and follows different principles:
Privacy: no tracking or profiling of users.
User-first: the user comes first, not the advertising and data
industries.
Independence: Brave has its own search index for answering
common queries privately without reliance on other providers.
Choice: soon, options for ad-free paid search and ad-supported
search.
Transparency: no secret methods or algorithms to bias results,
and soon, community-curated open ranking models to ensure
diversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright
censorship.
Seamlessness: best-in-class integration between the browser and
search without compromising privacy, from personalization to
instant results as the user types.
Openness: Brave Search will soon be available to power other
search engines.
I’m interested to see how it compares to DuckDuckGo (my default for several years now) in daily driving.
Roger Montti at Search Engine Journal had good things to say about it last week:
Brave search is currently in testing mode. So it’s not fair to
make judgments on an unfinished product. That said, the quality of
the search results that I have seen are outstanding in terms of
usefulness. […]
There is a lack of clutter in Brave that sets it apart not only
from Google but from Bing and DuckDuckGo. After using Brave, I
suspect that a reason why I have not embraced Bing, despite liking
Bing’s search results, is that Bing feels similar to Google.
Brave on the other hand offers me something different that feels
just right and makes me want to return to it, something I’ve never
felt using any other Google competitor.

The full release notes for Dark Sky version 6.8.6:
• Improved VoiceOver support

• Complications on Apple Watch update more frequently

• Addresses an issue that could prevent the moon phase from updating

• Stability and performance improvements
Apple acquired Dark Sky in March 2020, and while its Android app has since been shut down, it was recently announced that Dark Sky will remain available as an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch app and on the web until the end of 2022.



Apple's stock Weather app on iOS 15 features a new design with more detailed forecasts, notifications, and many other Dark Sky-like features.

30th anniversary Sonic DLC available in Minecraft’s marketplace
 Sonic the Hedgehog and friends are now playable in Minecraft, making good on a tease from Sega earlier this year. Sega and Minecraft developer Mojang promise “epic levels,” races against friends, and hidden secrets in the first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog’s blockiest adventure yet.
The whole gang’s here: Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Miles “Tails” Prower, Shadow the Hedgehog, Super Sonic, Dr. Robotnik, and, well, some Chaos. Big the Cat does not appear to be confirmed ... yet.
Minecraft players will be able to visit Sonic’s popular haunts, like the Green Hills Zone and Chemical Plant Zone, and battle bosses (Robotnik, naturally) in the new Minecraft Marketplace content. Players can also nab a free Sonic the Hedgehog character creator item. An upcoming two-week special event will feature Sonic the Hedgehog-themed minigames and “additional surprises.”
Sonic the Hedgehog turns 30 years old this week, and Sega is marking the anniversary with a variety of new game projects, including a Sonic Colors remaster, a retro collection that includes Sonic 3 and Knuckles, and a new 3D Sonic game coming sometime next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Arcade continues its strategy to bring classical and popular games to the game platform, with the latest addition soon to be the classic endless runner "Jetpack Joyride."





Jetpack Joyride was initially launched in 2011 and is developed by game developer Halfbrick. The game has grown in popularity and consists of Barry's main character embarking on a journey with a jetpack and entrusting the user to control them as they move and avoid obstacles. When it launches on ‌Apple Arcade‌, the game will be rebranded with the addition of a "+" to its name, leaving it to be "Jetpack Joyride +."



Other hit classic games such as "Fruit Ninja" and "Cut the Rope" launched on ‌Apple Arcade‌ earlier this year. ‌Apple Arcade‌ users can subscribe to notifications within the App Store for when the game becomes available.

A scoring center, you say?
 This season has been, if nothing else, one of adjustments. We’ve seen that really across the board, but we’ve seen it particularly with our next player up on the draft board. 
With the OHL season ultimately being cancelled this year, that left Mason McTavish, who spent last season with the Peterborough Petes, in a bit of a bind. Finding a way to get playing time was going to be a challenge, but it’s one that perhaps still worked out for him, as he got an early taste of professional hockey this season, as he got in a handful of games with EHC Olten, in Switzerladnd’s second-tier professional league. It was an abbreviated look, to be sure, but he was able to find a way to be effective in a league full of grown men, and …]]></summary>

Competitive mode separates PC and console; players may opt-out
 Overwatch’s long-requested cross-platform play launched on Tuesday, Blizzard has announced. The feature connects players on all platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.
The update means that all Overwatch players must set up a free Battle.net account (or connect to an existing one) and link it to their console accounts, regardless of whether they want to participate in cross-platform multiplayer.
Going forward, cross-play will be available to all Overwatch playlists, with limitations on the game’s Competitive mode. In Competitive, console players will be matched with one another, and PC players will only be matched with other PC players. Overwatch players can toggle an opt-out for cross-play, but that means they will only be matched with other players on their platform who have also opted out, which shrinks their pool of available matches.
In addition to cross-play support, Overwatch’s June 22 update introduces a new challenge — Ashe’s Deadlock Challenge — offering four new cosmetics, including a Legendary Ashe and B.O.B. Skin, for playing up to 27 games. Players may also watch up to six hours of Overwatch matches on Twitch to earn up to three more sprays.
The challenge ties into “Deadlock Rebels,” a new novel by Lyndsay Ely, which goes deep into the history between Ashe and another fan-favorite hero, McCree, and how they founded the Deadlock gang. A preview of its first chapter, localized in 14 languages, is also available for free beginning June 22.]]></summary>

Creative Studios will launch first in Los Angeles and Beijing, followed by Bangkok, London, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. later this year. In each city, Apple said it will work hand-in-hand with nonprofit community organizations to connect youth with mentors and established artists, such as Grammy Award-winning producer Larrance "Rance" Dopson.



Creative Studios programming will revolve around creative areas such as music, film, photography, and art and design, and will be available to young people who face barriers to meaningful artistic education, according to Apple. An eight to 12 week curriculum will provide hands-on sessions, insider industry knowledge, and ongoing feedback from mentors.



In Los Angeles, Creative Studios runs from June 26 to July 22, with free registration available on Apple's website.

The update went live Tuesday morning, and players have reported this problem to the studio since then. Forbes reporter Paul Tassi confirmed that bug revealed his information in white text at the bottom of a screenshot he posted to Twitter.

If you grew up reading The Crystal Shard, this one’s for you
 The first trailer for Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance is dark and haphazard, ridden with nauseating visuals set to post-hardcore metal that tries to sell a perceived coolness to a franchise associated with a tabletop scenario. It felt like a show of desperation, an attempt to prove something to an untapped player base. But that trailer couldn’t be any more misleading. Instead, Dark Alliance tapped directly into the comforting nostalgia of sitting on the floor of my bedroom as a child, bending the spine of the novel that would be one of my first exposures to Western fantasy and everything the genre would behold.

This isn’t a story about Elon Musk, or Tesla, or a contrarian take about how “oil is good, actually.” I unconditionally support electric vehicles in their quest to take over the primacy of gasoline-powered vehicles in the market. But I don’t save that enthusiasm for their prospects on society broadly. From the perspective of the built environment, there is nothing functionally different between an electric vehicle and a gasoline propelled one. The relationship is the same, and it’s unequivocally destructive. Cars, however they’re powered, are environmentally cataclysmic, break the tethers of community, and force an infrastructure of dependency that is as financially ruinous to our country as it is dangerous to us as people. In order to build a more sustainable future and a better world for humanity, we need to address the root problems that have brought us to where we so perilously lie today.

Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey show up in Zombie Army 4: Dead War
 Zombie Army 4: Dead War is a game where players battle the zombie armies of Hitler as they pour forth from a Hellmouth. It’s a terrible world where Europe is overrun by the walking dead, and it takes a lot of firepower to clean it up. Well, reinforcements have arrived.
The original cast of Left 4 Dead: Zoey, Francis, Louis, and Bill, are all playable characters in the game’s latest season, Rebellion Entertainment announced on Tuesday. Zombie Army 4’s latest update also adds a new map and mission. Players can delve into the Abaddon Asylum in the second mission of the “Return to Hell” campaign, where players must hunt down the deadly Baron Umbra. 
The map is available for $6.99, but the Left 4 Dead Character Pack is free on all platforms.
This isn’t the first time the Left 4 Dead cast have wandered out of their original game. All eight characters from both Left 4 Dead titles were playable in the original Zombie War trilogy. Bill has even shown up in Dead by Daylight, where players can uncover some scary lore about his past in Vietnam.
Zombie Army 4: Dead War launched in February 2020 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's largest manufacturing partner Foxconn is offering "record-high" signing bonuses in an effort to recruit workers for iPhone 13 production over the next few months, according to the South China Morning Post.




‌iPhone 13‌ Pro in Matte Black render via EverythingApplePro


The report claims Foxconn is offering up to 8,000 yuan ($1,235) as a signing bonus to former workers willing to return to its Zhengzhou, China factory to assist with iPhone assembly during the "peak season," up from 5,500 yuan last month and 5,000 yuan in 2020. Workers will receive their bonuses after working for Foxconn's iPhone assembly division for four months and staying until the end of the peak season, the report adds.



Apple manufacturers like Foxconn commonly offer signing bonuses in the months leading up to an iPhone launch, but this year's bonus range for returning workers is the highest since the Zhengzhou factory started operations in 2010, according to the South China Morning Post's review of past recruitment ads from Foxconn.



Apple is increasingly expected to unveil the iPhone 13 lineup in September, marking a return to its usual launch timeframe after unveiling the iPhone 12 lineup in October 2020 due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.



iPhone 13 models are rumored to feature a smaller notch at the top of the display, but otherwise they are expected to have a similar design as their iPhone 12 counterparts. Other key new features expected include a faster A15 chip, a 120Hz refresh rate on the Pro models, several camera upgrades, a new Matte Black color, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week made the HomePod mini available to order in New Zealand, with pricing set at $159 including tax. Available in Space Gray and White, the speaker currently faces a 2-3 weeks shipping estimate in the country.





Apple confirmed the HomePod mini would be launching in additional countries during its WWDC keynote earlier this month. The speaker became available to order in Austria and Ireland last week, and it will be released in Italy later this year. The international expansion comes after the full-sized HomePod was discontinued earlier this year.



HomePod mini was first released in October 2020 in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Spain, and the UK.




HomePod mini finally available to order in NZ today. The New Zealand apple store site didn’t allow you to order it till now. @MacRumors pic.twitter.com/cjPFZpocsf

Like the full-sized HomePod, the HomePod mini features built-in Siri for controlling music playback, managing HomeKit accessories, and more. Starting with tvOS 15, two HomePod minis can be set as an Apple TV 4K's default speaker outputs.

Alerts will be either national or localized depending on the threat level, and will be sent in cases of severe flooding, fires, explosions, terrorist incidents, and public health emergencies.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…
 It’s been another “fun” day of the NHL offseason (notice how fun is in quotes there, implying that the Flyers missing the playoffs is not, in fact, fun). Here are some links to pass the time.
Flyers News
*Among the multitude of defenders that have been named as reputed targets for Chuck Fletcher and co. this offseason, Matt Dumba is arguably the most interesting and risky. How exactly does he fit? (BSH)
*With the Flyers increasingly associated with Buffalo star Jack Eichel’s name in rumors, comments are coming out about the Sabres’ asking price for a trade. Apparently it’s pretty absurd. (Philly Hockey Now)
*Continuing BSH’s community draft board, Maddie took a look at arguably the highest upside player in the 2021 Entry Draft. Swedish goalie Jesper Wallstedt is a potential gem and looks like a franchise talent, much like Jaroslav Askarov of the 2020 class. (BSH)
*The Orange & Black owe their fans a lot of things, but they can start by picking a better goal song. “Feel The Shake” is lame. (BSH)
*Philly legend Reggie Leach went on Sportsnet’s “Lead Off” radio show to discuss Indigenous People’s Day and what it means to him. (Sportsnet)
Around The League
*NHL fans have been subjected to some... questionable officiating in this postseason. Absolutely nobody is shocked. (The Hockey News)
*The Islanders have sold out their first batch of season tickets for their new arena in Belmont. That’s excellent news for the NHL as it transitions to ESPN for a new TV deal, but not so great when considering that the Flyers will have yet another tough road environment in the division. (The Hockey News)
*People decided to say some nasty things on Twitter after Robin Lehner was announced as Vegas’s starter for Game 4. The veteran netminder kept those comments in the back of his mind and played with a chip on his shoulder en route to a win. (ESPN)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Underground passengers will be able to get mobile coverage across the rail network by the end of 2024, it has been announced.





In a press release, Transport for London (TfL) said the capital's Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road and Bank stations would be among the first fully connected stations by the end of the year, followed by Tottenham Court Road, Euston, and Camden Town by the end of 2022.



Mobile reception was introduced on the eastern half of the Jubilee line in March last year. TfL says the additional infrastructure will support 5G as well as 4G, but that it will be the responsibility of mobile operators to offer support for the fastest network speeds.



The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who was re-elected last month, said in a statement: 

"I promised Londoners that if they re-elected me for a second term as mayor I would deliver 4G throughout the tube network. It's already up and running on the eastern half of the Jubilee line and I'm delighted to announce today that I am fulfilling that commitment and full internet access will be available across the tube, with key central London stations such as Oxford Circus and Euston set to benefit before the end of next year."
TfL is partnering with BAI Communications (BAI), a global provider of 4G and 5G connected infrastructure, to plug so-called coverage "not-spots" in the underground network. The over 1,242 miles of fibre cabling installed in London Underground tunnels will also benefit above-ground coverage for buildings and other infrastructure by allowing more mobile transmitters to be installed.

        <updated>2021-06-22T07:57:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook this week launched its Clubhouse competitor in the U.S., called Live Audio Rooms, along with its new podcasts service, details of which we covered previously.





To begin with, Live Audio Rooms is only available to some public figures and certain groups, and can only be hosted through the Facebook iOS app, but both iOS and Android users can join a room, and the feature supports up to 50 speaking participants and an unlimited number of listeners. 



While Clubhouse already has a solid user base, it limits the number of people who can enter a room, so Facebook's offering has one up on its rival from the off. Facebook users can also "raise a hand" to join a conversation, and use reactions to participate in real time.



In addition, Live Audio Rooms is set to receive more features that Clubhouse presently lacks, including notifications when friends or followers join a room and live captioning.





Users can discover and join Live Audio Rooms within Facebook Groups. In private groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. Meanwhile, in public groups, both members and visitors can listen to the Live Audio Room, but in private groups, only members can listen. 



Live Audio Room hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate.



Among the U.S.-basd public figures with first access to Live Audio Rooms are music artist TOKiMONSTA, football quarterback Russell Wilson, Internet personality Omareloff, and entrepreneur Amanda Nguyen. Initial group conversations are also being hosted on topics ranging from dance and vegan food to guided meditation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is set to receive supply priority status from pure play foundry TSMC for iPhone 13 chip orders going into the third quarter of 2021, as the Taiwanese partner grapples with orders for automative and other device chips amid a supply shortfall, according to DigiTimes.




TSMC is also set to ramp up its output for the upcoming iPhone series in the third quarter, the sources indicated.
Other chip suppliers in Apple's supply chain, including Genesys Logic and Parade Technologies, are also scaling up supply to fulfill Apple's orders for the third quarter, which are said to be 30-40% higher than second quarter levels. 



With the ‌iPhone 13‌ series expected to follow a more usual launch timeline this year, chipmakers are poised to see Apple's orders peak for 2021 in the fourth quarter, said DigiTimes' supply chain sources.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models dropping in September are expected to look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end "Pro" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.



Though major design changes aren't expected, rumors suggest camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. Check out our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthew Panzarino, in a piece published just before WWDC:
An email has been going around the internet as a part of a release
of documents related to Apple’s App Store-based suit brought by
Epic Games. I love this email for a lot of reasons, not the least
of which is that you can extrapolate from it the very reasons
Apple has remained such a vital force in the industry for the past
decade. […]
This efficacy is at the core of what makes Apple good when it is
good. It’s not always good, but nothing ever is 100% of the time
and the hit record is incredibly strong across a decade’s worth of
shipped software and hardware. Crisp, lean communication that does
not coddle or equivocate, coupled with a leader that is confident
in their own ability and the ability of those that they hired
means that there is no need to bog down the process in order to
establish a record of involvement.
A truly remarkable email exchange, and a model of clarity and conciseness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josh Centers, writing at TidBITS:
We’re all eagerly awaiting iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS 12 Monterey,
and watchOS 8, but will they run on the devices you have now?
Apple continues to do an excellent job of supporting old devices,
but many iPhone and iPad features will require at least an A12
Bionic chip. On the Mac side, some of the new features require an
M1 processor.
Overall, maintaining support for old devices while restricting
certain new features to more capable recent models is a great
strategy. That way, fewer people are forced to buy new hardware
just to participate, but the new features encourage hardware
upgrades for those who want to take advantage of them.
It’s a testimony to Apple’s commitment to device longevity that iOS 15 will run on A9-based iPhones (2015’s iPhone 6S and 2016’s original iPhone SE). Of course they don’t get all the new features. The Android world is nothing like this.
Centers’s article is a detailed rundown of which devices get which features that were announced at WWDC two weeks ago.

I don’t think it is an accident that these bills were presented as

Cicilline has played his cards very deftly here: start with the
fact that while every bill was authored by a Democrat, they all
have a Republican co-sponsor; if some combination of these
regulations pass they will likely be with overwhelmingly
Democratic support, but the fact they are starting out as
nominally bi-partisan efforts is savvy.

A revenant, a time traveler, and a chonky sand monster walk into a bar...
 Legends of Runeterra, the card game set in the greater League of Legends universe, will feel quite different soon. On June 30, Riot will release Rise of the Underworlds, a new expansion with 40 cards. The patch also aims to make tons of balance changes to shake up the meta-game.
Rise of the Underworlds come with three new champions: the undead pirate Pyke, time-traveler punk Ekko, and monster queen Rek’sai. These playable characters in League of Legends make for powerful cards in Legends of Runeterra, and they are often the central point of several possible deck combinations.
The set also comes with a new keyword: Lurk, which powers up lurker enemies. Lurker enemies thrive when they’re at the top of your deck. When they’re in that position, and you attack your enemy, every Lurker ally in your deck gets +1 damage.

In terms of lore, the new cards will help round out the settings of Zaun, Shurima, and Bilgewater. Supporting cards from Legends of Runeterra can end up playing important roles in the longterm story of the setting.
Legends of Runeterra is a free-to-play game available on iOS, Android, and Windows PC. Riot will be revealing one new card from the set every day on strategy site Mobalytics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clinton Jones challenged his community of 3D artists to interpret a simple animation of a person walking with a heavy load. 2400 people participated and Jones collected the 100 renders for this video. What a fantastic illustration of the power of constraints and the abundance of human creativity. Ok, much of the imagery is borrowed from Star Wars and other sci-fi universes, but the stuff that isn’t is delightful. Even with no explicit narrative connection between the scenes, somehow this all seems like part of one big journey. One of the simplest stories we tell is someone moving from one place to another and it doesn’t need to be The Odyssey, Fury Road, or Thelma & Louise to be compelling.
You can also watch a video featuring all 2400 entries (it’s 2h 45m long) and a montage from a previous challenge featuring 125 artists.

A slice-of-life RPG set in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism
 A lot of flashy and exciting games got announced during E3 earlier this month. A second trailer (and release date) for Elden Ring! Bethesda’s Starfield! Arkane’s Redfall! But of all the games shown during this year’s biggest gaming news event, the game that’s stuck in my mind the most is a little indie title whose trailer was tucked into the back half of the PC Gaming Show: Citizen Sleeper.
Developed by Gareth Damian Martin, aka Jump Over The Age, Citizen Sleeper is a slice-of-life narrative RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games. Set on a derelict space station named Erlin’s Eye, Citizen Sleeper’s cast consists of a ragtag group of outcasts, hackers, mercenaries, and everyday folks try…]]></summary>

Battle your way through Icewind Dale
 Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance lets up to four players take on classic roles to battle through enemy armies. It’s a pretty straightforward hack-and-slash adventure, but there’s still advice we wish we had starting out.
In this Dark Alliance beginner’s guide, we’ll give you our seven best tips for your adventure through Icewind Dale.
Playing with friends unlocks new moves
Playing D&D: Dark Alliance solo is a hack-and-slash adventure without a lot of subtlety. Playing with friends is a little different. Pulling off certain moves like parrying or backstabs will trigger Team Attacks. These attacks make managing your enemies much easier and make those moves a lot more meaningful.

Should the Flyers be pursuing the Minnesota defenseman?
 It appears that Dougie Hamilton, the headliner of the 2021 free-agent market, is not the Flyers’ top priority.
In the latest edition of 31 Thoughts, Elliotte Friedman reports that the Flyers’ defensive targets seem to be elsewhere. He later expands on this point:
15. Philadelphia’s got a lot of balls in the air. I figured they’d be in on Hamilton, but, as mentioned above, he doesn’t appears to be their top target. I’m speculating here, but my guesses would include Seth Jones and Matt Dumba (who GM Chuck Fletcher knows very well). It also wouldn’t be a shocker if they have asked the Coyotes about 2019 first-rounder Victor Soderstrom. The Flyers liked him at that draft, and Arizon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite previous attempts to put the situation at rest, some iCloud users continue to experience spam calendar invitations, causing their calendars to be filled with random events.





The situation received widespread coverage in 2016, where Apple said that it was "actively working to address this issue" by "identifying and blocking suspicious senders." Victims are targeted in various ways. The most common method is by receiving a normal iCloud calendar invitation through their calendar app. 



Interacting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing "Maybe," lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.



Other users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a video posted by Apple Support, that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. 



The video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. 








One measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation. By redirecting invitations to their email, users can better manage and delete calendar invitations. For more detailed instructions, make sure to check out our how to.

Among the recipients in 2021 was CARROT Weather, a popular app known for its humorous weather forecasts.





CARROT Weather has since shared an unboxing video of its Apple Design Award with a similarly humorous tone, offering a closer look at the aluminum cube.



The quirky weather app was a winner in the "Interaction" category alongside Bird Alone. Apple said winners in this category "deliver intuitive interfaces and effortless controls that are perfectly tailored to their platform."






"CARROT Weather is known for its humorous forecasts and unique visuals," said Apple. "A recent design update has brought simplicity and elegance to its experience across all Apple platforms.

And it turns out, astronomers are about to witness the closest pass of this incredible round trip. Currently, 2014 UN271 is about 22 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun (for reference, Earth is 1 AU from the Sun). That means it’s already closer than Neptune, at 29.7 AU. And it’s not stopping there — it’s already traveled 7 AU in the last seven years, and at its closest in 2031, it’s expected to pass within 10.9 AU of the Sun, almost reaching the orbit of Saturn.
Before then, it’s expected to develop the characteristic coma and tail of a comet, as icy material on its surface vaporizes from the heat of the Sun. This close pass would give astronomers an unprecedented close look at Oort cloud objects.


C’mon NASA, let’s a get a probe fired up and visit this very unusual object!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Macintosh 128K fan has created a fun video that re-imagines the original Mac from 1984 in a modern-style advert.






The project comes from motion designer Thibaut Crepelle, who outlined the creative process behind the video in a Behance post.



I wanted to pursue my idea of creating modern motion design stuff for vintage products. 

For this piece, since everything is a learning experiment, I wanted to tackle a bit of UI and "animated modeling."



Today, its cubic design, its cute launch icon are elements well established in the computer horizon, and I wanted to pay an homage to that classic piece of hardware.








The Macintosh 128K was introduced in the now-famous "1984" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott, but Crepelle sought to match the vibrant, punchy Apple ads of today using a range of software and resources from Figma to replicate the classic Mac's UI and high-resolution animations that synchronized with the music.



Crepelle also included a number of easter eggs in the video, such as macOS Monterey's wallpaper and the gradient used on Apple's "One More Thing" Mac event graphics.

The Xbox creator has built up a diverse gaming lineup
 In Microsoft’s E3 2021 presentation last week, the Xbox maker finally revealed the fruits of its five-year plan to forge an empire. The company’s higher-ups have spent years building to this future, quietly toiling away at acquisitions and refining the Xbox platform while competitor Sony flashed its major cinematic games, like God of War and Spider-Man. Now, Microsoft has something to show for those seemingly slow years. 
Based on the Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, there appears to be no one “type” of gamer that the company is targeting, with games both big and small in the mix. Then there’s the temptation of a good deal with Xbox Game Pass, and ease of access via Xbox Cloud Gaming. But th…]]></summary>

We are no longer feeling the shake.
 A mark of greatness is a memorable gimmick, something that sticks in the minds of fans generations after the story of a team has come to a close. Remarkable periods of success are best enjoyed when there’s a certain moment, playoff run, or player that remains iconic even as time passes and the luster of a franchise is eroded by mismanagement and failure. These are the gems of the past that we, as Flyers fans, cling to; occurrences that gave us hope, that compel us to root for this infuriating product year in and year out.
Looking at recent examples, Simon Gagné’s Game 6 overtime winner, Claude Giroux’s overtime goal in the Stanley Cup Final, and Giroux’s magical shift back in the 2012 series against the Penguins c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following widespread reports that the iPhone 12 mini has experienced poor sales performance, at least relative to other iPhone 12 models, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce today claimed that production of the device has already ended.





According to TrendForce, the iPhone 12 mini "reached End-of-Life ahead of time" during the second quarter of 2021, suggesting that Apple will focus on selling through its existing inventory of the device without producing any further units. Launched in October 2020, the iPhone 12 mini features a 5.4-inch display that caters to fans of smaller smartphones, with pricing starting at $699 in the United States.



While production has reportedly ceased, the iPhone 12 mini remains available on Apple.com without any notable shipping delays for now. The device is offered in six colors, including a purple option that went on sale in late April.



Apple is still expected to unveil an iPhone 13 mini later this year, but rumors suggest the 5.4-inch model will be discontinued in 2022.

We’ve got a goalie in the mix, folks!
 At long last! We’re closing out the top-10 and we finally have a goaltender entering the draft board mix. 
Jesper Wallstedt had, in short, a pretty stellar season. At just 18 years old, he made a full time debut with Luleå of the SHL, and was really well able to hit the ground running. His team finished 5th in the SHL on the season with a loss in the quarterfinals, and Wallstedt was a key piece in that success. It was just about an even split of the workload for the goalies, with Wallstedt playing in 22 of their 52 games, and not looking even a bit out of place in his role. It’s really hard to overstate how huge that is for a player of his age, and that leaves us with a lot to be excited about with regard…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple will likely unveil its next-generation "iPhone 12s" or "iPhone 13" lineup in around two and a half months from now, and ahead of time, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce has outlined its expectations for the devices.





A summary of TrendForce's expectations:
Apple will unveil four new iPhones in September, including a mini model, a standard model, and two Pro models. September is the usual month for Apple to unveil new iPhones, but the iPhone 12 lineup was announced in October last year due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.


The new iPhones will have a smaller notch above the display, but will otherwise have a similar outward design as iPhone 12 models.


The devices will be powered by Apple's next-generation A15 chip manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm+ process.


All four iPhones will be equipped with OLED displays, while the two Pro models will also feature a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother content.


The new iPhones will have the same storage capacity options as their iPhone 12 counterparts. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models are available with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, while 12 Pro models have a 512GB option.


The rear camera system on all four iPhones will be equipped with sensor-shift image stabilization, a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. For the new Pro models, the Ultra Wide lens will gain autofocus.


The LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the Pro models.
With the pandemic showing signs of easing in the United States and Europe, TrendForce forecasted that annual iPhone production for 2021 will grow by around 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to 223 million units. The research firm believes the "iPhone 12s" lineup will account for nearly 40% of that total production volume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a TEDx Talk from 2017, LB Hannahs talks about their experience as a transgender dad, comfort vs authenticity, and the collision of theoretical gender roles & identities with the practicalities of parenthood.
Now, for most people, what their child will call them is not something that they give much thought to outside of culturally specific words or variations on a gendered theme like “mama,” “mommy,” or “daddy,” “papa.” But for me, the possibility is what this child, who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult, will call me for the rest of our lives, was both extremely scary and exciting. And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called “mama” or something like it didn’t feel like me at all. And no matter how many times or versions of “mom” I tried, it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable. I knew being called “mom” or “mommy” would be easier to digest for most people. The idea of having two moms is not super novel, especially where we live. 
So I tried other words. And when I played around with “daddy,” it felt better. Better, but not perfect. It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in. And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called “daddy” was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments. But, before I knew it, the time had come and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do, and my new identity as a parent began. I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 So we all agree that no sporting event happened in Philadelphia last night, right? Right. Anywho, onto the links.
*Ryan Pulock played hero for the Islanders in one of the crazier playoff moments you’ll find, given the circumstances in both the game and the series. (Sportsnet)
*So you want to fix the Flyers. What’s step one? (BSH)
*Is OEL a part of that solution? Oliver Ekman-Larsson has his detractors, but he’s yet another defenseman to keep an eye on as the Flyers’ quest to replace Matt Niskanen continues. (Philly Hockey Now)
*Perhaps Dougie Hamilton isn’t the Flyers’ main target, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a target. His impact would be massive. Charlie breaks it all down. (The Athletic)
*Two weeks back the Trois-Rivières Lions unveiled their gorgeous logo, sparking some conversation about the best hockey logos outside the NHL. (The Hockey News)
*Something that I’m sure many of us don’t want to think about is how Sean Couturier is set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of next season. There’s always some added fuel in a contract year. (NBC Sports Philly)
*Advertisements on jerseys? They may be on their way. Eek. (The Athletic)
*Our draft board continues with Finnish center, Aatu Räty. We’re inching closer and closer to the Flyers’ territory. That is, if they actually keep their pick. (BSH)
*Finally, Robin Lehner showed up in a big way for the Golden Knights in their series-evening victory last night. Of course, not without reading all of your mean tweets beforehand. (ESPN)]]></summary>

Websites that do not comply would be marked as being non-compliant on search engines, they could be excluded from search engine results, and banned from advertising in Russia and for Russians, the parliament said on its website.
The bill's authors argue that the current lack of such a requirement allows foreign sites to formally remain outside of Russia's jurisdiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Rayburn, writing for Streaming Media Blog:
On Monday, Apple announced some new privacy features in iCloud,
one of which they are calling Private Relay. The way it works is
that when you go to a website using Safari, iCloud Private Relay
takes your IP address to connect you to the website and then
encrypts the URL so that app developers, and even Apple, don’t
know what website you are visiting. The IP and encrypted URL then
travels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a
“trusted partner”. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple
would not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,
based on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on
the right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.
It’s a little weird that Apple doesn’t want to talk about who these “trusted partners” are, because if we don’t know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them? Putting your name on a product or service is a badge of trust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in iOS that effectively disables an iPhone's ability to connect to Wi-Fi.





Security researcher Carl Schou found that after joining a Wi-Fi network with the name "%p%s%s%s%s%n" his ‌iPhone‌'s Wi-Fi functionality was left "permanently disabled." 



Changing a hotspot's SSID did nothing to correct the problem, with even a reboot failing to make a difference, according to BleepingComputer. 



Other users who were able to replicate the issue have suggested the bug could be related to the initial use in the network name of the percentage sign, which leads to an input parsing issue whereby iOS mistakenly interprets the letters following the "%" as a string-format specifier.




After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID “%p%s%s%s%s%n”, my ‌iPhone‌ permanently disabled it’s WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~) pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3
— Carl Schou (@vm_call) June 18, 2021
 


In C and C-style languages, string format specifiers have a special meaning and are parsed by the language compiler as a variable name or a command instead of standard text.



Android phones don't seem to be affected by the same network, but iPhones hit by the problem need to have their network settings reset before a Wi-Fi hotspot can be connected again.



To perform the reset, open the Settings app, tap General -> Reset, then tap Reset Network Settings and confirm the request at the prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fox Now app has removed support for the third-generation Apple TV, with the app now only compatible with fourth-generation and later models of Apple's set-top box.





Existing installs of Fox Now on third-gen Apple TVs no longer work, and the app has been removed from home screens, preventing users on the older hardware from accessing Fox live and on-demand content like TV shows and sports.



First spotted by Appleosophy, the change follows a Fox Now announcement in May that it would no longer support the third-gen box from June 17. Similar moves to drop third-gen support have been made by other streaming apps this year, including YouTube and CBS All Access.



While native third-gen ‌Apple TV‌ support has dropped, the Fox Now app is still available on iPhone and iPad, which means anyone with one of these iOS devices can still AirPlay Fox Now content to their ‌Apple TV‌ for watching, albeit indirectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with Ampere to offer MacRumors readers a chance to win a pair of Dusk sunglasses. The Dusk sunglasses aren't your standard pair of sunglasses -- they have adjustable electrochromic lenses.






You can use an accompanying app or a control on the sunglasses themselves to adjust the tint level, plus these are smart sunglasses with integrated speaker and microphone so you can also listen to music and take phone calls. 





Like many sunglasses that play music, the Dusk sunglasses use an open ear audio feature that lets you listen to music without disturbing those around you. The built-in battery gives you four hours of playtime before needing to be recharged, but it lasts for seven days when you're just using tint control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, the Photos app has been given a significant update that includes a richer Info pane to view information about a photo in your library, such as the camera, lens, and shutter speed used, the file size of the image, and where the image came from if it was saved from within another app. 





In another notable addition, you can also edit the date and time when a photo was taken. Here's how it's done in the latest ‌‌iOS 15‌‌ developer beta, a version of which will be available to the public in July.


Launch the Photos app and tap a photo to select it.


Tap the info button (the encircled "i" icon) below the image.


Tap Adjust next to the date and time.


Use the calendar and the time dial to choose a new date and time, then tap Done.


Elsewhere in ‌Photos‌, ‌iOS 15‌ features a considerable update to Photo Memories, which now feature a new design, integration with Apple Music, a more interactive interface, and more intelligent memory types, such as improved pet memories, including the ability to recognize individual dogs and cats.



For more information on ‌iOS 15‌, check out our dedicated roundup. Apple will make ‌‌iOS 15‌‌ available for general release this fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long wait, YouTube for iOS is officially gaining picture-in-picture support, allowing all users, non-premium and premium subscribers, to close the YouTube app and continue watching their video in a small pop-up window.





In a statement to MacRumors, YouTube says that picture-in-picture is currently rolling out to all premium subscribers on iOS and that a larger rollout to all US iOS users will take place soon. It's worth noting, again, that this feature will be available to all users, despite some speculation that YouTube may have limited picture-in-picture support for only paying subscribers.

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows users to watch YouTube videos in a small mini player while simultaneously browsing outside of the YouTube app on their mobile device. We’re starting to roll out PiP for YouTube Premium members on iOS and plan to launch PiP for all US iOS users as well.
YouTube picture-in-picture has been a constant back and forth game, with it sometimes working via the YouTube website on Safari. Some users have found creative workarounds utilizing Shortcuts to turn off built-in parameters on the YouTube site that disables picture-in-picture. Now, though, with official support rolling out and soon to be more widespread, those workarounds will no longer be needed.

Last month, Apple listed the Space Gray accessories as available while supplies last, and the company has now removed the product pages from its website entirely, as spotted by Appleosophy. The accessories remain available in Silver, but keep in mind they have not been updated since October 2015.



The new iMac with the M1 chip is available with colorful new Magic accessories, including a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, but Apple has not yet made these accessories available for purchase on a standalone basis.

This is one of the first major discounts on the HomePod mini since it launched last year, and it's in stock in both Space Gray and White at this price on Simply Mac.





The HomePod mini is a smaller version of the HomePod, measuring in at 3.3 inches tall compared to the HomePod's 6.8-inch height. The HomePod mini features a fabric-covered spherical design with a flat top that has a backlit touch interface interface for activating Siri and controlling music.




$19 OFF
HomePod mini for $79.99





The only other notable deal for HomePod mini we've tracked in 2021 was a $10 sale at Expercom. Given the low entry price of the smart speaker, steep discounts have been rare, and will likely continue to be as we move into the rest of the year.

The Flyers could really use Finnish dudes, even if this one is possibly the Finnish Nolan Patrick. 
 Aatu Räty is a prospect that falls at No. 9 here on our big board, which might end up being the top end of where he could fall in the actual draft later this summer. 
Räty’s name has been on the scouting communities mind for a few years now — and at one point even looked like sure-fire top-five pick just a few seasons ago, with mentions along the likes of his Finnish countrymen Mikko Rantanen and Aleksander Barkov depending on who you talked to. 
But that stand-out 2018-19 season (.75 points per game) is firmly in the rearview mirror as Räty has seen his production decrease in each of the past few seasons — albeit coinciding with a rise in competition up f…]]></summary>

Trade for Eichel! Do it! 
 The Flyers have similar needs to last year this offseason. In fact, they have the same needs this offseason as the last.
Despite the similarities, the main difference as the Flyers approach free agency this season is the shift in attitude. After the Flyers’ success during the end of the 2019-20 season in the Toronto bubble (for lack of a better term, we can consider winning a playoff series a success), the team and front office staff had every right to feel confident with the group at hand, and thus, major moves were not a focus that offseason. However, a disappointing 2020-21 campaign exposed the flaws in the Flyers’ handling of their key weaknesses, and the optimism present a year ago no longer exists as bois…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple supplier TSMC is preparing to produce 3nm chips in the second half of 2022, and in the coming months, the supplier will begin production of 4nm chips, according to a new report from DigiTimes. 





Apple had previously booked the initial capacity of TSMC's 4nm chip production for future Macs and more recently ordered TSMC to begin production of the A15 chip for the upcoming iPhone 13, based on an enhanced 5nm process. 



Today's report outlines a more long-term plan for TSMC, stating that the new 3nm chip process will offer 15% performance boost alongside 30% improved energy efficiency and will enter mass production late next year. 

TSMC has claimed its N3 technology will be the world's most advanced technology when it begins volume production in the second half of 2022. Relying on the proven FinFET transistor architecture for the best performance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness, N3 will offer up to 15% speed gain or consume up to 30% less power than N5, and provide up to 70% logic density gain.
While the report doesn't offer any detail of how the new 3nm chip can be implemented into Apple products, it's safe to assume its still years away. Apple's 14 chip, currently in the iPhone 12 series and iPad Air, is based on the 5nm process. The M1 Apple silicon also shares the same 5nm architecture.



The smaller process provides improved performance and energy efficiency and offer more freedom with product design, thanks to their smaller overall footprint.

Even platforming masters aren’t immune 
 Trolls are the most recognizable element of ultra-hard Mario hacks and levels, known as kaizo. A simple, unexpected obstacle is not only funny but also creates that special sauce that makes kaizo so fun to watch. But not all trolls are created equally, and many creators use different interpretations of the concept to subvert players’ expectations.
A subgenre under the broader umbrella of ROM hacking, kaizo hacks emphasize precision and mastery in a way that’s much more difficult than normal Mario platformers. These user-created games are also are known for containing an abundance of trolls. Some particularly devilish or clever levels are even designed to exploit the player’s knowledge of the genre and its conventions. Here a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has released updates for iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor, introducing a handful of new features such as enhanced media search and notifications for encoding batches, as well as bug fixes.





iMovie 10.2.4 brings sixteen new solid and textured backgrounds with adjustable colors, the ability to import projects created with iMovie for iOS (version 2.3), and general stability improvements. 



Final Cut Pro 10.5.3 allows users to create and save custom column arrangements in the browser, and edit them with the Column Set Editor. The update also enhances the browser search with expanded criteria including clip text, markers, and notes. Users can quickly search for clips by media type. There is the option to search for original, proxy, or optimized media, as well as missing media.



Motion 5.2.2 fixes a large number of issues with 3D object rendering brightness on M1 Macs and emojis rendering incorrectly in HDR, as well as unexpected quitting when closing a project after export, closing the HUD, adjusting the opacity of a gradient, or when dragging media or an object into a USDZ.



Compressor 4.5.3 brings notifications for completed, failed, and canceled encoding batches, embedded audio descriptions when encoding a variety of video file formats including MOV, MP4, M4V, and MXF, and stability improvements.

        <updated>2021-06-18T09:06:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.





Apple announced last year that it would embark on a two-year-long journey to transition all of its Mac computers, both desktops, and laptops, to use its own in-house processors. Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, M1. 



As a result of the four Macs with ‌M1‌ and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.

However, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.



Intel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.
Intel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs. Bloomberg reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as 32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics for future Mac releases.

Players have until Saturday afternoon to claim it
 GOG.com has a free game available for the next two days, and it’s a pretty good one: Absolute Drift: Zen Edition, by Funselektor, whose follow-up Art of Rally launched in September.
Absolute Drift, for Windows PC is a series of drifting/gymkhana challenges raced from a stylized, top-down perspective, somewhat resembling a Micro Machines racing game. Absolute Drift launched on Windows in 2015, and then on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in August of 2017. It launched at the beginning of 2021 for Nintendo Switch, too. Absolute Drift is ordinarily $11.99; it has a “Very Positive” user rating on Steam.
We were enamored of Funselektor’s Art of Rally, which is a different type of racing but has similar stylish visuals. This video gives a better idea of what Absolute Drift entails.

Rare reveals new gameplay of Pirates of the Caribbean expansion
 Sea of Thieves developer Rare dropped a big surprise on Sunday during E3 2021’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase: Captain Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones are coming to the silly seafaring game in a new, Pirates of the Caribbean-themed adventure called Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life. On Thursday, Rare gave fans another look at that forthcoming content with a new gameplay trailer.
The new trailer shows off more of the new story, spooky new areas, new enemies, and new cosmetics — yes, you and your crew will be able to dress up like Jack Sparrow — coming in Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life when it launches June 22 as a free update. The gameplay trailer also apparently reveals that players will come face to face, literally, with the game’s Kraken.
Sea of Thieves is available on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and is included as part of a Xbox Game Pass subscription.]]></summary>

The Apple Watch is highly water resistant, and it's more than durable enough to stand up to sand and sea water. It can be worn in the water while surfing, especially when you have the right band, but make sure to rinse your Apple Watch with fresh water after it's been exposed to salt water.

Senua’s Saga sounds still very early in development
 Ninja Theory’s sequel to Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t make an appearance at Microsoft’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase at E3 2021 for what sounds like a very good reason: The game, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, appears to still be quite early in development, based on a new update from the developer.
Tameem Antoniades, “chief creative ninja” at Ninja Theory, said in a development update Thursday that the Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 team is currently “building a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest.”
Antoniades said that Ninja Theory “didn’t want to do a straight sequel — we wanted to do something extra special, and so we’re making our lives as difficult as possible in that pursuit.”
Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 will be set in ninth-century Iceland, Antoniades said, and to properly capture that setting, Ninja Theory has sent its “art and audio teams out there doing photography, photogrammetry, and combining it with satellite data to recreate large swathes of the landscape.”
“On the character front, we’re building real costumes [and] scanning them in,” Antoniades said. “We’re collaborating with Epic Games to bring you next-generation digital characters, [and] on the combat front, we want it to be extra real and brutal, so Melina [Juergens], our main actress, has been training for two years, and all of our animators have undergone combat training.”
Antoniades’ update concluded with “not a trailer, not a gameplay reveal, but montage of the kind of work we’ve been up to.”
Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 was first announced in December 2019, at The Game Awards, as one of the first Xbox Series X games. The original Hellblade was released in 2017, and was praised for its narrative structure as well as the performance of Melina Juergens. That game told the story of Senua, a Pict warrior who travels to the Norse plane of Helheim.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.



Live Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an M1 Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.



Other updates include WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.



The new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both macOS Big Sur and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.



The ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website.



Apple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

Destiny’s story is about to get (more) complicated
 A new update in Destiny 2 suggests that Savathun, the titular Witch Queen in the game’s upcoming expansion and sister to Oryx, has taken human form in the Last City. And fans are freaking out.
As Destiny 2’s story has improved, players have gotten even more ravenous for details on upcoming story beats and expansions. So far, Season of the Splicer has told a mostly contained story about prejudice and refugees. But players discovered a new lore page on Tuesday that really escalated the threat in this Destiny 2 season, potentially setting up story beats for the upcoming expansion.

C’mon, EA! It was a favorite play for Madden himself!
 Madden NFL 22 is launching with a lot of new features, including new layers to the Franchise mode that should deepen an experience hardcore fans have felt was neglected. But it will not, for the 30th consecutive year, include the fair catch kick. Curses! Drat!

Norway you should miss out on this Swede new update
 Microsoft Flight Simulator’s virtual world is getting a gorgeous new update, making the game’s Nordic region more beautiful than ever. World Update 5: Nordics for Asobo Studio’s flight sim gives some love and attention to landmarks and airports across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The update is free and available now.
Microsoft says that World Update 5 includes improvements in detail to “broad swaths of landscapes, enhancements to regional architecture, improved data for 100 airports and 78 carefully selected points of interest.” As seen in the gameplay trailer above, those points of interest include Lego House, Frederiksborg Castle, and the city of Copenhagen in Denmark; Uddevalla Bridge, Avicii Arena, and Sarek National Park in Sweden; Olavinlinna and the city of Helsinki in Finland; Flakstad, the Arctic Cathedral, and Holmenkollbakken in Norway; and Hallgrímskirkja, Jökulsárlón, and Hvítserkur in Iceland. Not shown: how much I’d really like to visit any of those places in real life right now.


Local airports — Denmark’s Bornholm, Iceland’s Ísafjörður, Sweden’s Stockholm Arlanda, Norway’s Svalbard, and Finland’s Vaasa — have all been “carefully replicated by hand for maximum realism,” Asobo Studio said in a post on the Microsoft Flight Simulator website, which names every new point of interest. The update also includes localization in Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish.
Microsoft Flight Simulator is available now on Windows PC and is coming to Xbox Series X on July 27. A Top Gun-themed expansion for the game is planned for later this year.]]></summary>

The site Star Trek + Design is collecting the futuristic design objects — chairs, cups, silverware, sofas — that designers used on the sets of Star Trek movies and TV shows to depict the future.
Being drawn to the aesthetics of Trek, especially of The Next Generation, made me curious about the specific objects that set designers used to create the visual embodiment of what living and working on a starship would look like in a technologically-advanced, post-scarcity future.


For instance, this is an RBT Chair by Teknion used in Star Trek: Discovery:

Park Avenue glasses made by Anchor Hocking were used for barware in TNG:

Voyager used Arne Jacobsen’s AJ Flatware in several episodes (as did Kubrick’s 2001):

In these draft talks, Owen Power and Matty Beniers have been getting a lot of love, deservedly, but they have another teammate who’s eligible for this draft and probably deserves to have a bit more hype himself. 
Kent Johnson had, in short, a really stellar freshman season with Michigan. He finished the season 12th in scoring in the conference, and second among freshman, behind teammate Thomas Bordeleau. It took a bit of time to adjust, but he was a real impact player for the Wolverines this season, and pretty quickly asserted himself as one of the most dynamic playmakers on an already …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared a teaser trailer for "The Shrink Next Door," an eight-episode limited comedy series starring and executive produced by Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd. The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to Apple's announcement.






Based on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says "The Shrink Next Door" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac "Ike" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin "Marty" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.
Over the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.
The project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since "Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues" in 2013.



In other ‌Apple TV+‌ news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of "Truth Be Told," an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer. The series is set to return August 20, with new episodes released every Friday.






In season two, investigative reporter turned true crime podcaster Poppy Parnell (played by Spencer) dives into a new case that deeply involves her childhood friend turned media mogul Micah Keith (played by Kate Hudson).

Meet KAY/O
 Valorant’s newest Agent is a robot named KAY/O with the power to suppress his enemies’ abilities. The new Agent will be part of Valorant’s Episode 3 update, which should also include a fairly large patch for the game.
KAY/O is an Initiator, which means he’ll be great at pushing his way onto sites and breaking through enemy defenses. One of KAY/O’s abilities allows him to throw a special knife that prevents enemies in a small area from using their abilities — an effect called suppressed. His Ultimate includes something similar but radiates out from his body. KAY/O’s Ultimate also gives him a Combat Stim when he uses it, and if he dies during the Ultimate he’ll have the chance to be revived by a teammate.

        <updated>2021-06-17T14:33:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today lowered the prices of AppleCare+ plans for MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models equipped with the M1 chip. Coverage offered by the plans, as well as accidental damage fees, appear to remain unchanged.





In the United States, AppleCare+ for the MacBook Air now costs $199, down from $249. The new price applies to both M1 and Intel-based MacBook Air models, although Apple no longer sells the Intel-based model directly.



For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has split AppleCare+ into two separate plans for the M1 and Intel-based models, with pricing for the M1 model lowered to $249, down from $269. Notably, the price of AppleCare+ for the Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pro remains $269, so customers opting for the Apple silicon model now receive a slight discount.



The new lower prices are also available in other countries we've checked, such as Canada, with discounts varying based on the local currency.



Customers who recently purchased AppleCare+ for one of the affected MacBook models can contact Apple Support for assistance with cancelling their current AppleCare+ plan and purchasing a new one at the lower price, according to information obtained by MacRumors, but Apple did not provide a cutoff date for eligibility.



AppleCare+ for Mac provides up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other damage. AppleCare+ also provides 24/7 priority access to Apple's technical support representatives by online chat or phone.

Patch 1.23 is another bug squasher
 Developer CD Projekt Red rolled out a new patch for Cyberpunk 2077 on Thursday, patch 1.23, that squashes more bugs and fixes a variety of quest-related issues in the first-person shooter. The patch arrives just days before Cyberpunk 2077 is set to return to Sony’s PlayStation Store, after a six-month absence.
Console players will therefore be pleased to read that patch 1.23 for Cyberpunk 2077 promises “numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems” and “various console CPU optimizations,” according to CD Projekt Red’s patch notes. The developer says the update will reduce the number of overall crashes.

 It was a preseason game, Clint Oldenburg said. “Not a regular season game, not a playoff game.” The crowd in Seattle still annihilated his ability to think.
“When I was at the line of scrimmage, I couldn’t hear anything. All I could hear was the crowd,” said Oldenburg, today Madden NFL 22’s gameplay producer, back then an offensive lineman trying to make the Denver Broncos’ 53-man roster. 
Yes, home-field advantage is real, Oldenburg said. With crowds returning after a pandemic year quieted the NFL’s stadiums last fall, they’ll be a more noticeable part of the league’s video game, too. But a home field’s challenge won’t simply be in ramped-up volu…]]></summary>

In which Eamon does his best Paul Holmgren impression.
 The Flyers are on the hunt for an impactful star player, one who can become the centerpiece of this upcoming generation after the former crown jewels (Nolan Patrick, Ivan Provorov, and Carter Hart) all regressed this past year. In particular, the team has reason for concern at forward. Outside of single season performances from Travis Konecny, Oskar Lindblom, and Joel Farabee, the Orange & Black are devoid of young talent up front that looks remotely capable of supplanting the aging star trio of Giroux, Voracek, and Couturier. Recent reports have put the Flyers in play for Jack Eichel, but his enormous contract and coveted status across the league will likely impose a heavy toll on …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has today announced that it is awarding "innovation grants" worth five million dollars to four historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), as reported by USA Today.





Alabama A&M University, Howard University, Morgan State University, and Prairie View A&M University will receive the grants as part of Apple's wider $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative that was announced earlier this year.



The grants, set to be issued over a three-year period, are part of Apple's New Silicon Initiative. The scheme is intended to help students prepare for careers in hardware technology and chip design. The grants will support each university's engineering school and help expand emerging hardware technology courses. Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said in a statement: 
The HBCU community is home to incredible Black talent and we are thrilled to work alongside these universities to enhance the opportunities for their students. We know many jobs of the future will be in innovative areas like silicon engineering and we want to help ensure the leaders of tomorrow have access to transformational learning opportunities.
 The "innovation grants" will also include select scholarships, fellowship opportunities, and internships at Apple, giving students the opportunity to engage with Apple engineers and learn from their experience.

"Facebook will be the place where people can enjoy, discuss, and share the podcasts they love with each other," said the company in the emails.



Podcast episodes will appear in a forthcoming "Podcasts" tab, which was teased by the company in April. Facebook will also offer podcast creators an optional feature that lets listeners create clips of shows of up to one minute in length for sharing. 



Facebook isn't asking for a cut of any revenue that podcasters generate, but the terms of service state that Facebook reserves the right to make "derivative works" with content distributed on its platform.



The move follows growing interest in podcasts as another potential market of original content, with Apple recently launching its own paid subscriptions service in the Podcasts app. Apple takes 30% of all subscription revenue that creators generate in their first year on the platform, and after that, Apple takes a 15% cut.



Spotify has invested heavily in deals to exclusively distribute podcast shows in recent years, and offers a similar podcast subscription feature to Apple, except the streaming service doesn't collect revenue on any of the content it hosts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly eyeing a new partnership with LG that would allow the South Korean tech giant to sell iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches at its more than 400 retail "LG Best Shops" in South Korea, according to a report from Business Korea.





LG recently shut down its smartphone business, leaving retail space previously used for marketing its handsets being left empty. Apple is now, apparently, eyeing to use that retail space to sell its own iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Apple's own retail presence in South Korea is still relatively small, and accepting a deal with LG to sell its products at more than 400 "LG Best Shops" is an easy way to expand its presence.

The two companies are reportedly discussing the establishment of separate Apple corners within the shops that are directly run by Apple employees or allowing LG Best Shop employees to sell Apple products after LG Electronics acquires the right to the sale of Apple products. The two sides have yet to decide when the partnership starts, but some market experts predict that it will be some time after the end of July when LG Electronics completely pull out of the smartphone business
According to the report, LG and Apple are at a disagreement over the sale of Mac computers. LG sells its own "Gram" laptops, and offering Apple's Mac in the store would be a disadvantage. As a result, the two sides are likely only to agree on selling iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. An LG spokesperson said in a statement to Business Korea that "nothing has been decided yet" and that they're "exploring all possibilities."

        <updated>2021-06-16T21:24:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key new feature of macOS Monterey is the ability to AirPlay content to a supported Mac from other Apple devices, such as an iPhone or iPad, and we've confirmed with Apple that this will include Apple Fitness+ workout videos with one limitation.





After starting an Apple Fitness+ workout on an iPhone or iPad, users will be able to wirelessly stream the audio and video to a supported Mac using AirPlay, providing a convenient way to view the workouts on a larger screen. The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.



AirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:
MacBook Pro (2018 and later)


MacBook Air (2018 and later)


iMac (2019 and later)


iMac Pro (2017)


Mac mini (2020 and later)


Mac Pro (2019)
We've encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.



Apple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.



Launched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.

A multiplayer game for friendship
 There are some multiplayer games that come with a warning: Play with your friends and family at your own risk. That includes games like Overcooked and any Mario Party title — Overcooked for the stress of working together in chaotic scenarios, and Mario Party for the inevitable strain of betrayal. This doesn’t mean these games aren’t great or fun: They’re fantastic! They can both bring you together or tear you apart. But in the end, the games are infamous — for different reasons — for the fights they create.
However, I’ve found the antidote: Chicory: A Colorful Tale. Released in June, Chicory is a 2D adventure game named after a famous painter who stops paint…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously, there are trees. But speaking phylogenetically, trees aren’t a thing. Some things that are trees evolved from things that are not trees and other things that are trees evolved into things that aren’t trees. Confused? This might clear things up.
“Trees” are not a coherent phylogenetic category. On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are absolutely, 100% not trees. This means that, for instance, either:
The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.


See also there’s no such thing as a vegetable and there’s no such thing as a fish.
What would the evolutionary tree of salmon, lungfish, and cows be? The answer, it appears at first glance, is simple. Salmon and lungfish, being fish, would cluster nicely together on one branch, and very non-fishy cows would be off on a separate branch. Right? Wrong. Contrary to what you might expect, what you see above is their evolutionary tree. Working up from the root, the lineage that leads to salmon branches off first. Keep tracing up the tree, and you’ll see that the lineage from which the salmon branched off eventually branches into two new lineages: the one leading to lungfish and the other leading to cows. In other words, a cow and a lungfish are more closely related to one another than either is to salmon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple would not be permitted to sell iPhones with its own apps installed under proposed U.S. antitrust legislation that was released last week. Representative David Cicilline confirmed the self-preferencing ban in a discussion with reporters, details of which were shared by Bloomberg.





Rather than pre-installed apps, Apple would have to offer other app options for consumers to download. Right now, iPhones come with a range of free Apple-designed apps from Messages and FaceTime to Calendar and Notes.



"It would be equally easy to download the other five apps as the Apple one so they're not using their market dominance to favor their own products and services," said Cicilline.



Preventing Apple from selling iPhones with its own apps installed would drastically change the iPhone's setup process, making it considerably less streamlined, more complicated, and potentially more expensive if customers were prompted to purchase or subscribe to third-party apps and services to replicate the functionality that Apple provides at no cost.



According to Cicilline, this would also apply to Amazon Prime because Amazon's ability to sell its own products over third-party products disadvantages some sellers.



U.S. House lawmakers last week debuted sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation in the form of five different bills aimed at major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The bills would apply to businesses that have a market capitalization of $600 billion and at least 50 million monthly active users in the United States.



If passed, these bills would overhaul competition laws that have not been revisited for decades and would lead to significant changes in the tech industry. The House Judiciary Committee will review the five bills at a hearing next week.

Much of the discussion centered on privacy, as it often does in interviews that Cook participates in. He reiterated once again how important privacy is to Apple.
We've been focused on privacy for over a decade. We see it as a basic human right. A fundamental human right. And we've been focused on privacy for decades.

But can its systems support more complex play?
 Free Lives is best known for its 2014 side-scrolling action game, Broforce. The game features pixelated caricatures of action movie heroes blowing stuff up with big guns and even bigger American flags. So imagine my surprise in early June when the team announced its next project, Terra Nil, a “reverse city-builder” about restoring wild areas after an ecological disaster.
After spending a few hours with an early demo of Terra Nil, it’s hard to imagine a bigger departure for the studio, but I’m all in. After nearly two years of homebound hyper-vigilance brought on by political chaos and a global pandemic, this is the deeply chill distraction that I needed.

Still talking defense!
 We simply cannot stop talking about defensemen around here, apparently. Next up on the board we have Simon Edvinsson, a Swedish left shot defenseman, and also one of the more polarizing players in this top prospect group. Edvinsson is a bit of a project, and scouts are divided on just how high his ceiling is, and what his chances are of reaching it, but the fact also remains that he possesses one of the more dynamic toolkits of this same top prospect group, and all of that makes him an intriguing name to watch.

The "M2" chip purportedly destined for the next-generation MacBook Pro models has already entered mass production, according to supply chain sources, but there have been several reports that Apple has experienced unexpected delays with the production of the new models.

These updates brought about improved performance, better battery life, and more. There's also a 256GB model, but we aren't seeing any notable discounts this week.

On Monday, Apple said that some customers would be unable to make in-store purchases with their ‌Apple Card‌, and two days later, the issue continues to persist. These new issues follow a widespread Apple Card outage earlier this month that lasted several hours, impacting all ‌Apple Card‌ customers. The current issue facing some ‌Apple Card‌ customers is limited to in-store purchases, but online purchases seem to be working as normal. 



‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a tightly integrated financial service into Apple's products and services. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs to be the issuing bank for the card, meaning it's currently limited to just the United States. ‌Apple Card‌ features are integrated into the Wallet app with color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and up to three percent cashback on purchases, paid out daily.



Update: Apple's system status page now says that the issue is resolved and ‌Apple Card‌ is working as normal.

The project, which has since stalled due to internal concerns, was to offer customers an all-encompassing healthcare service that would integrate data collected from the iPhone and Apple Watch. On the project's heels, an internal team studied how data collected from the Apple Watch could improve healthcare service.

One of its most ambitious healthcare ideas was a plan to offer primary-care medicine, conceived in 2016, according to documents and the people familiar with the plan. An Apple team spent months trying to figure out how the flood of health and wellness data collected from use…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter is considering offering users the ability to "unmention" themselves in other people's tweets as part of a wider privacy drive for the social media platform.





The early concept has been shared by Twitter designed Dominic Camozzi, who says the idea behind it is to help users control unwanted attention.



An example image shows a notification when the user has been mentioned in a tweet, with an option to "Unmention yourself" (i.e. remove your Twitter handle from it) without the author of the tweet being notified of the change.



In another related option currently being weighed up, Twitter could send you a notification when someone you don't follow mentions you, allowing you to review the tweet, unmention yourself from it, and block that user from mentioning you again.




Notifications
Going further, if someone you don’t follow @ mentions you, you’ll get a special notification. If you unmention yourself from there, the Tweet author will not be able to mention you again. pic.twitter.com/RTFBEnkPFf
— Dominic Camozzi (@_dcrc_) June 14, 2021
 


Additionally, Camozzi is toying with the idea of giving users the ability to "control mass mentions" by preventing anyone on the platform from mentioning them for one day, three days, or seven days, thereby providing respite for anyone inundated with activity related to their account.



As with all early concepts, these changes may or may not be implemented by Twitter, and the company is actively looking for feedback from users regarding the ideas.

"We're always re-evaluating how we go to market across the world, but we've got no such plans now to do that. We're happy with the models that we've got right now. We won't limit ourselves and say no to anything. But right now, we have no such plans for that."

For persevering through his recovery, he gets an award. 
 The Philadelphia Flyers have won something for their 2020-21 season... well, a player has.
Oskar Lindblom has won the Bill Masterton Trophy as the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey on Tuesday.
Congrats, @oskarlindblom!   
An inspirational journey culminates with winning the Masterton Memorial Trophy. #NHLAwards pic.twitter.com/duFkbVvIJN
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) June 15, 2021



Back in December 2019, Lindblom was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer (Ewing’s sarcoma). His season ended immediately and the hockey world surrounded the Flyers’ winger with support.
Just several months later, he was able to ring the bell at the Abramson Cancer Center at Pennsylvania Hospital, signifying that his cancer treatments were complete and he was on his way to full recovery. And less than two months after that, he was back on the ice in the middle of a playoff series against the New York Islanders in September. A remarkable comeback for a player that has played a pivotal role on the team the most recent season.
After coming back from his diagnosis and recovery, Lindblom played 50 games and earned 14 points in his supporting role.
Lindblom is the fourth member of the Flyers to win the Masterton — Ian Lapierre (2011), Tim Kerr (1989), and Bobby Clarke (1972) have earned the honor before him as members of this organization. This season, San Jose Sharks legend Patrick Marleau was named a finalist for still playing well into his old age and passing Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL games played record, and Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba was the third finalist for continuing his presence as a co-founder of the Hockey Diversity Alliance and impacting his local community off the ice.
At least something pleasant has come as a result of the 2020-21 Philadelphia Flyers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, one of several new accessibility features that Apple has introduced is Background Sounds, which is designed to minimize distractions and help you stay focused, stay calm, and minimize distractions with the help of your iPhone or iPad.





The Background Sounds on offer include balanced, bright, and dark noise, as well as natural sounds like ocean, rain, and stream. All of the sounds can be set to play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.



The following steps explain how to enable Background Sounds on iOS devices running ‌iOS 15‌.
Launch the Settings app on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.


Tap Accessibility.


Under "Hearing," tap Audio/Visual.



Tap Background Sounds.


Tap the switch to turn on Background Sounds.


Tap Sound to choose a sound effect.


Choose from Balanced Noise, Bright Noise, Dark Noise, Ocean, Rain, and Stream.


Your device will need to download individual sound effects when you play them for the first time, so make sure you have an internet connection, but after that you can play the background sound whether or not you're online.

Officially licensed to ‘fuck shit up’ says Evil Geniuses’ MK11 star
 Five-time EVO champion SonicFox now has their own plushie. “This furry gremlin has been signed off by SonicFox to officially fuck shit up,” says the merch store for Evil Geniuses, SonicFox’s club since last spring.
The plushie is 10 by 11 by 4 inches, 100% polyester, and “Modeled after the ‘Defender of Trans Rights’ themselves,” says the plushie’s product page. “The community begged for it; SonicFox listened.” And that, as they say, is that.
SonicFox (real name Dominique McLean) was named Esports Player of the Year at The Game Awards 2018. In 2019, after coming out as non-binary, their 72-hour Mortal Kombat livestream raised $22,000 for The Trevor Project, a national advocacy organization focusing on LGBTQ persons under age 25. Active since 2013, SonicFox joined Evil Geniuses in March 2020, shortly after winning Mortal Kombat Final Kombat 20.
Most recently SonicFox took first place and a $15,000 prize in WePlay Esports Ultimate Fighting League’s Mortal Kombat 11 tournament, a Tier 1 event held in March. They prevailed 5-4 and 5-1 in the grand final using The Joker against Sayed “Tekken Master” Hashim Ahmed, playing as Cetrion.]]></summary>

The biggest new addition with the patch is probably coming to Zombies mode with the new Mauer der Toten round-based map. Unlike the Outbreak mode with its massive map, Mauer der Toten will be more of a traditional Zombies experience, including a return to Berlin. If Outbreak is more your style, there’s also a new Zoo area for that mode as well. Finally, both Outbreak and Mauer der Toten will have Easter eggs that kick off on Thursday, June 17.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mayo Clinic today debuted support for the Apple Health records feature available on the iPhone, allowing Mayo Clinic patients to add their medical records to the Health app.





Health Records is a feature that's designed to allow patients to view and aggregate all of their health data in one easy-to-access spot on the ‌iPhone‌. More than 700 institutions and 12,000 care locations now offer support for Health Records in the United States, Canada, and the UK.



Mayo Clinic patients who have a Patient Services Account can access that data through the Health app using their Patient Services username and password. The feature is opt-in and available as an option for Mayo Clinic patients with an ‌iPhone‌.
"There are more ways than ever for patients to be actively engaged in their health care, and smartphone apps can be helpful for accessing records and tracking daily fitness and diet," says Steve Ommen, M.D., medical director of Experience Products for Mayo Clinic's Center for Digital Health. "We want patients who are interested in these apps to be able to use them securely and enhance their health care at Mayo Clinic."
Health Records are downloaded onto the ‌iPhone‌ using an encrypted connection, with the data stored on the user's device and encrypted with a passcode to ensure everything is kept private. Health Records data is not available to Apple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With macOS Monterey, Apple has introduced expanded AirPlay 2 support, so you can ‌AirPlay‌ content from an iPhone, iPad, or even another Mac to your main Mac. We thought we'd do a quick demo of this handy new feature in our latest YouTube video.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


With ‌AirPlay‌ to Mac, you can extend or mirror an Apple device's display to a Mac, and since two Macs are supported, a Mac can use another Mac as an external display, which is a kind of substitute for the Target Display Mode that used to exist for Macs.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works wirelessly or using an appropriate cable, and the wired connection is useful for cutting down on latency.



You can also turn your Mac into a speaker that can be used for multiroom audio alongside other ‌AirPlay‌ 2 devices.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works with the 2018 or later MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, 2019 or later iMac or Mac Pro, the ‌iMac‌ Pro, and the 2020 or later Mac mini.



Apple has also added a useful new Universal Control feature that lets you control multiple Macs and iPads with a single keyboard, trackpad, or mouse, but Universal Control does not appear to be functional in the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta.

that’s me. I was five.

Also, fun fact: When we were watching a Mo Willems episode about drawing, he told us that his child is transgender — the one from Knuffle Bunny. Trixie is now Trix!

On Twitter, ‌Apple Music‌ users in India have been questioning why Spatial Audio is not available and when it might be launching, especially because the feature has been coming and going for some users. Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio has not yet officially launched in India, but Apple has not forgotten about the country and has confirmed that spatial audio is debuting soon.



The Apple Music website in India has a "coming soon" tag for Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio. There is no specific launch date available as of yet, but because some users have been seeing the options appear and disappear, it's likely ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers in India won't have too much longer to wait.

Yep, there’s another one!
 You read that right, folks, another Hughes brother has entered the chat. Luke Hughes is finally having his moment, and despite all of the talk around him that’s being circled back to his brothers ad nauseam, he’s been finding quite a bit of success for himself. After a bit of a slow start to his season, he picked up some steam as he went on, and ended up scoring at a cool .88 point per game pace (not too bad for a defenseman, certainly). But his season was cut short when he suffered a lacerated tendon in his foot from a skate cut, which required surgery. It was a tough way to end it, but it was a good year for him overall, and the individual hype he’s garnered because of it is well deserved.

Oh good, I can play Monkey Target again
 The first three Super Monkey Ball games, Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, are getting an HD remaster. Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania will launch worldwide on Oct. 5 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Super Monkey Ball franchise, as announced by a release from Sega.
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania will come to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. It will cost $39.99 for the console version and $29.99 for the PC version. 
The remaster brings back the original three games with updated graphics and additional, modern features like online challenges and leaderboards. It also introduces a comic book-style of storytelling and new playable characters. Key features of the original, like 4-player local co-op will still be present in the remaster. Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania recreates roughly 300 levels and 12 minigames from the first three games.
In the Super Monkey Ball franchise, players navigate a monkey in a hamster ball while playing sports-inspired minigames or perilous and zany obstacle courses. The first two games launched in the early 2000s  exclusively to the GameCube. The franchise has since launched on numerous platforms, consoles to mobile versions, with more than a dozen titles.
Sega also announced a Digital Deluxe version of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. It will feature six additional classic character skins, three legendary console skins, 10 customizable items and the classic soundtrack. Fans will also be able to grab a special 20th Anniversary Edition of the game that includes an art book, reversible cover, collectable sleeve and 10 cosmetic items. The Digital Deluxe edition will retail for $49.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The horror game was originally released on the Wii U
 The most recent game in the Fatal Frame series is getting a modern update with Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water for Nintendo Switch and other modern consoles. The new version of the game was revealed during Nintendo’s E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. 
The game takes place on the fictional Hikami Mountain where players control several different characters as they attempt to survive the notoriously supernatural mountain and the variety of hostile spirits and ghosts that occupy it. Each of the game’s protagonists lends a different prospective to the game’s overall story of Ose Kurosawa, a mysterious shrine maiden who was chosen to be part of a powerful and dark ritual. 
Maiden of Black Water is the fifth mainline game in the Fatal Frame series and was originally released in 2014 on Wii U. Just like all of the games in the series, this one focuses on a series of supernatural experiences and spirits that can only be warded off by using a special camera, called the Camera Obscura. The new version of the game will also come with new costumes and photo modes that weren’t in the original, as well as updated visuals.
Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X sometime later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared the trailer for the second season of animated comedy "Central Park," which is set to launch on Apple TV+ on Friday, June 25.






"Central Park" follows a family who serve as caretakers for Central Park in New York City and who must fend off a wealthy hotel heiress who wants to turn the park into condos.



In the second season, the family continues to navigate living in and caring for the park.
In season two of "Central Park," the Tillerman family continues to navigate living in and caring for the world's most famous park. Molly experiences the trials and tribulations of adolescence, Cole is challenged by a truly embarrassing moment at school, Paige continues to chase down the mayor's corruption story, and Owen juggles managing the park, his staff and his family all with a smile on his face. Meanwhile, Bitsy inches ever closer to her sinister goal of claiming Central Park as her own; with Helen by her side, eternally wondering whether she's made it into Bitsy's will. Every step of the way, we are guided along by our friendly, fumbling, fiddler narrator, Birdie.
"Central Park" characters are voiced by Josh Gad, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Kathryn Hahn, Tituss Burgess, and Stanley Tucci. It was created and written by Loren Bouchard, known for "Bob's Burgers."



The first season of "Central Park" was recognized with an Emmy Award nomination for Leslie Odom Jr., and was also nominated for the 2021 NAACP Image Awards in the Outstanding Animated Series category.

This video by Kurzgesagt leads us through what happened that day, minute by minute.
This video reminded me of Peter Brannen’s eye-popping description of this event from his book The Ends of the World:

Seth Jones might not be the surefire No. 1 defender that some prop him up to be, but he’s capable of returning to that level of play.
 I’ll preface this article by saying that I would prefer the Flyers to acquire a number of players instead of Seth Jones if they’re looking to fill the role of a top pair defender this offseason (they ought to be). Personally, the addition of any among Ryan Ellis, Dougie Hamilton, Mattias Ekholm, or John Klingberg would make me happier than seeing a blockbuster Jones trade on draft day. This is not an article advocating for the acquisition of Jones, so please don’t interpret it that way.
With all of that said, Seth Jones receives entirely too much vitriol from the analytics community when he’s a player who …]]></summary>

“Conference” final time!
 It’s chaos time, folks! We’re down to the final four in the playoffs, and none of these teams have seen each other all year, so this is surely going to be... interesting, to put it lightly. The playoffs have been weird so far, and they’re only going to get weirder, it seems. Is it a fool’s errand to try and make any kind of prediction here? Maybe, but that’s certainly not going to stop us from trying. 
Tampa Bay Lightning vs. New York Islanders

Maddie: I want to pick the Lightning here, because I think they’re the better team and that should win out and be the end of it. But I also think the Bruins are a better team than the Islanders and should have knocked them out last round, and we saw what happened there. But I'm g…]]></summary>

You have one week to try them all
 Xbox’s whirlwind week at E3 2021 isn’t just limited to big new IPs and AAA launches on Xbox Game Pass. Starting today, Xbox One and Xbox Series X owners can also get their hands on demo versions of 40 yet-to-be-released indie games as part of the ID@Xbox Summer Game Demo Fest.
If you want to try them out, you shouldn’t wait. The showcase only runs for one week, from June 15-21. 
The list of demos is filled with upcoming indie titles like the adorable animal-filled adventure game Button City and the Tribeca Film Festival award-nominated Sable. Oh, and also you can go play Lawn Mowing Simulator, if that scratches your virtual homeowner’s itch. 
Here are the 12 newly announced games coming to Xbox you can play:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using publicly available datasets of English words, their etymologies, and their semantic distances, software engineer Daniel de Haas generated pairs & triples of words that have a common origin but otherwise are unrelated to each other. 
“actor” & “coagulate”
Both of these words derive ultimately from the Latin “ago”, meaning “act”, “do”, “make”, and a bunch of other things.
English “actor” is a short hop away from “ago”, but “coagulate” takes a longer path: “ago” ➔ “cogo” (“collect”) ➔ “coagulum” (“a clot”) ➔ “coagulo” (“to clot”).



“educate” & “subdue”
“Educate” comes from the Latin “eductus”, meaning to “lead or bring out”, and then the Latin “educare” (“raise, train, mould”). I love the image of education as the process of extruding a refined person out of a base of unrefined material.
“Subdue” comes from the latin “subduco”, meaning “lead under”. Again, a very clear physical description of what the word means — to put beneath you, or bring under control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve South today launched the "SurfacePad for iPhone 12," a new MagSafe-compatible wallet folio case for the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 mini. The $49.99 leather case comes in brown cognac, black, and plum colors.





The SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ was designed to protect the front and back of the ‌iPhone 12‌, and includes two interior pockets for ID and bank cards. Since the cards are on the front portion of the folio, you'll also be able to wirelessly charge your ‌iPhone 12‌ with the SurfacePad on, unlike Apple's first party wallet accessory.



To attach SurfacePad to an ‌iPhone 12‌, there's a "SurfaceGrip 2.0" adhesive on the back of the accessory, which sticks to the back of your iPhone. Twelve South says this adhesive is reusable and super secure and it leaves no trace of sticky residue when removed.





You can purchase SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ on Twelve South's website today for $49.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today announced an investigation into the "duopoly" of Apple and Google on mobile ecosystems, just one day after a similar investigation was initiated in Japan.







The CMA will be taking a closer look at Apple and Google's "effective duopoly" on the supply of operating systems, including iOS and Android, the App Store and Google Play Store, and web browsers such as Safari and Chrome. The CMA defines "mobile ecosystems" as "gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services," meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.



The CMA says that consumers could be "losing out across a wide range of areas" as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to "reduced innovation" and "consumers paying higher prices." The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies' market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.



The CMA was already investigating Apple's ‌App Store‌ policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.



The UK is also in the process of establishing a new "pro-competition" regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. 



Yesterday, the Japan Times reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google's duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple in iPadOS 15 has added the ability to access NTFS-formatted media from within the Files app. The additional support for the Windows-related format, first discovered by YouTuber Steven Fjordstrøm, is read-only, so like on macOS you can't modify files stored on NTFS devices, but you can at least copy any data on them for working on elsewhere on your iPad.





The Files app has also gotten a new circular progress indicator to indicate the transfer of data when moving or copying files. Tapping the graphic opens a larger progress bar showing further details on the data transferred/remaining, the estimated time remaining, and the ability to cancel the transfer.



In another notable addition to the Files app, if you're using a mouse or trackpad, it's now possible to click-hold and drag a selection box over multiple files and folders to perform batch actions, such as compress, move, copy, and so on. Lastly, you can also now use Groups as a view option, so that files and folders are arranged on the screen in separate sections according to kind.



What do you think about the new additions to the Files app? Let us know in the comments. ‌iPadOS 15‌ is currently going through beta testing with developers, with a public beta due out next month and an official release in the fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple last month announced that the HomePod mini would be made available in several new countries in June. Now, less than a month later, the ‌HomePod mini‌ has officially launched in Austria and Ireland, and is listed as "available in June" in New Zealand, suggesting availability in the next couple of weeks.





The ‌HomePod mini‌ is the follow-up to the original HomePod released in 2018. The full-sized ‌HomePod‌ failed to become a mainstream hit, leading to its discontinuation. The $99 ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌ but offers the same functionality enabled by Siri. 



The ‌HomePod mini‌ first launched in October of 2020 in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Spain, and the UK. Both the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ will gain support for Apple Music's recently launched lossless audio feature via a software update later this year. Additionally, the ‌HomePod mini‌ will be able to be set as the default output speaker for Apple TV 4K starting later this year.

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-tv-plus-three-month-free-trial/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-15T08:49:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while now, Apple has been running a promotion that offers a free one-year trial of Apple TV+ with any iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch purchase. That promotion ends on June 30, and Apple has today updated its website to show that from July 1 the included free trial shrinks to three months with eligible device purchases.





Apple has frequently offered promotions or credit for users to stay subscribed to the still relatively new service. Launched in 2019, ‌Apple TV+‌ continues to grow into a more mainstream streaming service; however, it still has some ways before catching up to Netflix and others. Apple offers original shows such as "Ted Lasso," "The Morning Show," and "See" on the platform.



The new three-month trial will go into effect on July 1, so customers wanting to maximize their free ‌Apple TV+‌ subscription should purchase their product before the beginning of next month. Devices purchased before then will continue to be eligible for a one-year trial. 



The offer of a generous year-long free trial for ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ has been an important part of Apple's strategy to lure in long-term subscribers by giving unfettered access to the full roster of content on the streaming service. ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ launched with a small amount of content compared with other rival services, so it has been crucial for Apple to build goodwill and interest about the service's shows without expecting immediate returns. The company now appears to feel that the content offering has grown enough that a shorter trial will suffice going forward.



The new extension comes ahead of a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, where several hit shows, such as "Ted Lasso" and "The Morning Show," will see their second seasons debut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Apple has now announced that Apple Podcast Subscriptions for shows and channels is rolling out worldwide, showcasing a large number of new shows, groups of podcasts, and channels.



When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they automatically follow the show and the page is updated with a Subscriber Edition label so it is clear that they have access to the premium experience. As listeners subscribe to more channels, the Listen Now tab expands with new rows to provide easy access to all subscription content. Listeners who subscribe to two or more channels will also see a My Channels row in the Listen Now tab.








As expected, Apple Podcasts has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.





Apple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then decided to delay its launch to ensure that the "best experience" is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.



All subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple's 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-music-android-beta-spatial-lossless-audio/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-15T07:44:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Apple last week launched Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio for Apple Music, it said that the new features would be "coming soon" to Android. Now, the company has released a new ‌Apple Music‌ beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.





As per the changelog for the release, spotted by 9to5Google:

In this update, ‌Apple Music‌ adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.



Other updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.
In the app's Settings menu, there is a new "Audio Quality" sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.



The beta release for ‌Apple Music‌ 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.



Note that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.



Getting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‌Apple Music‌ user base on Android won't have to wait much longer to get these features, too.



Apple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‌iPhone‌ 7 and later, all iPad Pro models, the 6th-generation ‌iPad‌ or later, the iPad Air 3 and later, the fifth-generation iPad mini and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/MacBook Air, and the 2020 or later iMac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, you can enable anyone, even if they don't have an Apple device, to join a FaceTime call with you by creating a link to a ‌FaceTime‌ conversation that can be shared anywhere.





Using this new link facility, friends and family members who do not have an Apple account can log into a ‌FaceTime‌ call with you using a web browser opened on any non-Apple device, whether that's a Windows PC or an Android phone.



This effectively makes ‌FaceTime‌ a platform-agnostic video service, although you do need to be an iOS or Mac user to start the ‌FaceTime‌ call and send the link. Here's how it works in ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌.




Launch the FaceTime app on your iPhone or iPad.


Tap Create Link.


Give your ‌FaceTime‌ Link an identifiable name by tapping Add Name at the top of the Actions menu that appears.


Select a method of sharing your link from the Actions menu, e.g. over Messages or Mail.




Once you've sent the link and the recipient opens it, they'll be directed to a web page where they can enter their name to join the conversation. Once they've joined the call, they'll have the usual ‌FaceTime‌ options to mute their microphone, disable video, switch the camera view, and leave the call.





For more information on all the new ‌FaceTime‌ features in ‌iOS 15‌, be sure to check out our upcoming dedicated guide.

This is the yoke and throttle that you’ve been looking for
 We’ve known that Microsoft Flight Simulator was coming to Xbox consoles for literally years now. This week at E3 Microsoft finally gave us a launch date — July 27. What remained unclear to fans, however, was how they were actually going to fly those airplanes on a console. Sure, you could use an Xbox controller, but the grass is especially green on the PC side of the fence with a boatload of boutique controllers and high-end joysticks. 
Fear not, console pilots, for Turtle Beach has come to your rescue with the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System. It’s a full-fledged yoke and throttle compatible with Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Windows 10. The announcement was made Monday in a n…]]></summary>

Capcom says DLC is now in development
 The story of Resident Evil Village will continue in a new expansion, Capcom announced Tuesday during its E3 2021 showcase. By popular demand, Capcom said, “development has just started” on additional DLC for the game. 
Unfortunately, Capcom did not provide details about its plans, but promised more info at a later date.
Resident Evil Village producer Tsuyoshi Kanda said that players will have something to look forward to next month, however. Kanda announced that Resident Evil RE: Verse, the deathmatch multiplayer mode that features heroes and bioweapons from the Resident Evil franchise, will go live in July after a brief delay.
The previous game in the franchise, Resident Evil 7 biohazard, received a number of post-release story-based add-ons, including Banned Footage Vol. 1 and 2, Not A Hero starring Chris Redfield, and End of Zoe.
Resident Evil Village was released in May for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. In our review of the first-person survival-horror game, we called Village’s blend of gunplay and scares “the perfect cocktail of horror and action.”]]></summary>

Still green, though
 Microsoft is, apparently, changing the game cases for Xbox titles. Box art seen at Best Buy and other retailers more prominently calls out the compatible platforms while eschewing the embossed Xbox logo that fronted game cases since the launch of Xbox One.
It’s a subtle change and, considering how many full copy sales of video games take place online today, one that some may not notice for a while. It also seems necessary considering Microsoft is supporting two consoles and, the Xbox Series X’s backward compatibility notwithstanding, some games are in fact Series X only.
Microsoft has long aspired to unify its video games presence under a single brand, but it still can’t quite seal the deal. Xbox games are sold on The Microsoft Store, for example, while PC subscribers peruse the Xbox Game Pass for PC library. And let us never speak of Games for Widows Live, which Microsoft needed two years to finally shut down.
Bottom line to you, the consumer: Not much, really. The design change probably means Microsoft saves a few cents stamping the Xbox logo on the top. We now return you to your regularly scheduled E3.]]></summary>

 Xbox fans wondering why Rare’s Everwild didn’t show up at Sunday’s E3 showcase now have an answer: The studio has “completely rebooted” the open-world adventure game under a new creative director, and its release is multiple years away, reports Video Games Chronicle.
Citing sources with knowledge of Everwild’s development, VGC reports that Rare has undertaken “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction” following the departure last fall of its previous creative director, Simon Woodroffe. Gregg Mayles — who has worked at Rare for more than three decades, and is the studio’s most senior employee on the creative side, according to VGC — has been tapped as creative director for the ongoing reboot, VGC repo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular iOS and Mac-based journaling app Day One has been acquired by Automattic, a company best known for running WordPress.com. News of the acquisition was announced today on the Day One blog.





The Day One app will continue to be run separately, and Day One founder Paul Mayne will continue to lead the Day One team. Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.
When a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company. That's not the case here. I'll be remaining at the helm of Day One, leading the same passionate team that has been responsible for the development and design behind the app today. This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn't going away. Instead, it'll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.
Day One's privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it's long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.



Day One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings. Day One Premium is priced at $3.99 per month and the app can be downloaded from the App Store. [Direct Link]

Announced on Monday, the team has re-signed forwards German Rubtsov and Linus Sandin to one-year, two-way deals that will carry a league-minimum $750,000 cap hit if they are on the NHL roster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad, known for its range of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the Card for AirTag, which is designed to make it easier for an AirTag to fit inside a wallet for tracking purposes.





With Card for AirTag, an AirTag fits inside the middle of a card-shaped holder that's then meant to fit inside of a wallet. According to Nomad, the design offers a smooth, uniform shape that allows the AirTag to be kept in the wallet without having a circular bump.



The Card for AirTag is made from a polycarbonate material with a soft-touch TPU surface, and the AirTag is designed to snap into the middle.





It's worth noting that the AirTag is quite thick on its own and not really designed for use within wallets, so this Card for AirTag is still going to take up a lot of space. Thin wallets may not accommodate the thickness of the AirTag and the accompanying Card accessory.



The Card for AirTag is priced at $20, but there's a $5 discount when bundled with one of Nomad's wallets. Nomad is also today releasing new Bi-Fold and Card wallets priced starting at $69.95. The Card for AirTag and the new wallets can be purchased from the Nomad website.

The update will also include new zombies content and new maps
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting a new season in just a few days and Treyarch has finally given fans a preview of what they can expect. According to the new  roadmap, season 4 will have a new round-based Zombies map, new weapons, new maps, and another update to Verdansk — just not quite as big as the last one. 
The new addition to Verdansk will be a new location centered around a crashed satellite — the focus of the season’s reveal trailer, which debuted during Summer Games Fest last week. It seems that the crash will take out some existing structures, but is also big enough for players to fight in and around. Meanwhile, Verdansk’s season 3 Reloaded addition of the Nak…]]></summary>

Jack wants chaos? Jack gets chaos
 Square Enix revealed a new spinoff Final Fantasy game at its E3 2021 press conference on Sunday, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin. And while a new Final Fantasy game might sound like exciting news at a conference thin with announcements, fans were quick to notice a fatal flaw with its protagonist, Jack. 
He wears a T-shirt.  
He dons a simple, black, short-sleeved shirt with buttons on the front. If it weren’t for the ragged hem hanging down over his crotch and butt, it looks like something you could buy from the men’s section at Target. It might sound like a small thing, but this is the world of Final Fantasy, where everybody and their mom usually has an ornate, whimsical character designs. And Jack is the protagonist…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the New Yorker, Hannah Fry wrote a brief history of information visualization, a quiet innovation that has changed the world:
Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, “only a graph speaks directly to the eyes.” Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them — and the stakes dependent on those differences — became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, “If the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.”
Van Langren’s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study “Visual Explanations” (1997), “Maps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.” Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error — how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.


Van Langren’s graph, which Fry says “might be the first statistical graph in history”, is pictured at the top of this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: PlatinumGames/Square Enix
    

  
PlatinumGames’ latest looks a little rough around the edges, but there’s hope
 On Sunday, Square Enix showed off new gameplay from Babylon’s Fall, the PlatinumGames-developed hack-and-slash that was first announced way back in 2018. It looked drastically different from the early gameplay preview we saw in late 2019, which made Babylon’s Fall look like a fairly traditional PlatinumGames release.
It also, frankly, looked a little ... off. What I (and others) perceived as heavily compressed streaming video artifacts obscuring the game’s graphics is actually Babylon’s Fall’s intentional art style. PlatinumGames says it’s going for a “visual style is based on classical European oil paintings” that it calls “brushwork style.” To wit, taking a closer look at direct-feed screenshots of Babylon’s Fall reveals that the graphics are being treated with a canvas-like texture and what appear to be actual brushstrokes.
“Our goal was to create a deeply layered, high quality fantasy world rendered in the oil painting style seen in classic sword and sorcery fantasy works,” said Babylon’s Fall game director Kenji Saito in a behind-the-scenes look at development.


PlatinumGames and Square Enix tapped artist Kouji Tajima to create the game’s high-fantasy art style. Tajima’s previous work is mostly in live-action film, he says, working on movies like Terminator: Dark Fate, Venom, Blade Runner 2049, and the Fantastic Beasts series.
The most encouraging bit of news on Babylon’s Fall is who’s overseeing it, the aforementioned game director Kenji Saito. He directed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Transformers Devastation, two of Platinum’s better games. He’s joined by Isao Negishi, lead game designer on Babylon’s Fall, who had the same credit on Nier: Automata.
Babylon’s Fall is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam. Square Enix has not announced a release date.]]></summary>

The iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 updates can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings > General > Software Update.



According to Apple's release notes, iOS 12.5.4 introduces important security updates and is recommended for all users. Apple often releases security updates for older devices that are no longer able to get the current version of iOS in order to keep users protected from malware and other security vulnerabilities.



Apple's security support document says that the update addresses three vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Two of them that affected WebKit may have been actively exploited. One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.

To install the ‌watchOS 7.6 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS 7.5 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the iPhone by going to General > Software Update.



To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



We don't know what's included in the watchOS 7.6 update, and no new features were discovered in the first two betas.

Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV models, the tvOS 14.7 developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There's no word yet on what's included in tvOS 14.7 update, but we'll update this article should anything new be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

Halo multiplayer is all about hunting for power weapons
 Players got some new details around Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer during 343 Industries and Microsoft’s Halo multiplayer livestream on Monday. The livestream showed off a little more than 10 minutes of new gameplay and developer interviews. It gave 343 Industries an opportunity to deliver its philosophy for Halo Infinite's multiplayer: old school.
Early in the stream, 343 Industries developers made it clear that players will start on equal footing with “fair and balanced starts,” and that they wanted to go back to the old-school Halo style of hunting for power weapons once you spawn. However, it’s not currently clear if Halo Infinite will have loadouts.

Infinite will also give players more customization options than ever, including the AI voice in multiplayer
 343 Industries is totally reshaping Halo’s multiplayer customization in Halo Infinite by adding a few hallmarks of popular free-to-play games. The studio released a multiplayer overview on Monday, where it revealed what players could expect for all the game’s cosmetics when it comes out later this year. 
Because Infinite is the first Halo game to feature free-to-play multiplayer, it’s no surprise that the team at 343 is ramping up cosmetics and customization. Not only does it give the developer more items to sell, but Infinite is inviting players to spend hundreds of hours in the Halo arena, and with time investment like that it’s always more fu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Cold War, the Soviet Union controlled the music recording industry and even restricted the types of music that were allowed to be played & listened to. Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock & roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:
X-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl — some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand — and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.


And from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:
Before the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‘n’ roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.
“Usually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,” says Sergei Khrushchev. “Before the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.”
“They would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,” says author Anya von Bremzen. “You’d have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha’s brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.”


To learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates’ book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records — here’s Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:

The Beats Studio Buds are available to order today in red, white, and black ahead of a June 24 ship date, and they're priced at $149.99.





The Studio Buds are the first Beats-branded earbuds to truly compete with AirPods thanks to their wire-free design that fits comfortably in the ear without the over-ear hook seen on Powerbeats Pro.






In many respects, the Studio Buds are competitive with AirPods Pro at a lower price point, with a diminutive design that's slightly lighter than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ while still offering features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency modes.

Spatial Audio, based on Dolby Atmos, is an immersive surround sound audio format that enables musicians to mix music so it sounds like the instruments are all around you in space. Thousands of Apple Music songs are available in Spatial Audio as of last week, such as Lady Gaga's "Rain on Me" and Kanye West's "Black Skinhead."



Spatial Audio is available to all Apple Music subscribers at no additional cost. The streaming music service costs $9.99 per month for individuals, $4.99 per month for students, and $14.99 per month for families of up to six people.

This is a pivotal offseason for Chuck Fletcher with the Flyers’ veteran core and underperforming youngsters at a crossroads.
 When you look at the Philadelphia Flyers roster, it’s split into a few different groups. 
There is the veteran core made up of a few guys that have been here for years (Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek, Sean Couturier) plus the recent additions (Kevin Hayes, James van Riemsdyk).  All five of those players are 28 years old (or older) with varying contract statuses. The two most valuable Flyers forwards in that group — Giroux and Couturier —have their contracts expire after next season, while the other three are under contract through 2023 (JVR), 2024 (Voracek), and 2026 (Hayes).
This is the veteran core that could be s…]]></summary>

Apple shared a teaser trailer for the second season on YouTube:






Starring and executive produced by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, "The Morning Show" unveils the power dynamics in the workplace between women and men, and women and women, in a morning talk show environment. Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, the star-studded returning cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, and others.



Apple's announcement sets the stage for what to expect in season two:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds "The Morning Show" team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley's (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.
Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial available. An extended one-year free trial is also available with the purchase of most new Apple devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the Photos app, such as the ability to see the EXIF data for a photo. The latter feature is accessed via a new "Info" button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.





In addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn't take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the HomePod image was saved from the web via Safari. 



This metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the "Saved from" location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don't have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll. 



The new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you've saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.



‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.

As of Monday morning, the delivery option for the full-sized ‌HomePod‌ on Apple's online store is listed as "sold out" in both black and white. 





Up until recently, the black model was sold out in the U.S. but the white color was available for delivery "while stocks last." That's currently no longer the case, and though Apple's white ‌HomePod‌ listing still allows customers to check availability for in-store purchase and pickup, the speaker has been unavailable in nearly all retail locations since the beginning of June.

Studio Fizbin’s thoughtful puzzle-platformer got a surprise release on Sunday
 You’ve heard this story before. Though the details may be different, the thrust of the story is the same. When the world goes to shit, there’s only one person who can save us — the chosen one, through their sheer power of chosen-ness, must set off on a calamitous journey to stop whatever terrible thing is threatening the world. 
It’s Link in the Legend of Zelda, Master Chief in Halo, Kratos in God of War. These sorts of heroes also appear in smaller-scale stories, in more intimate worlds, like the player-character in Cozy Grove, perpetually taking on everyone else’s needs. But being a hero can be isolating, even traumatic.

Coming to PC and consoles in 2022
 PC gamers itching for a Pikmin-like fix have Tinykin to look forward to in 2022. The game, from developer Splashteam, stars a tiny protagonist and a small army of helpful insects — the titular Tinykin — was revealed Sunday during the PC Gaming Show.
Here’s the narrative setup for Tinykin:
It’s the year 2748 and Milo has re-discovered Earth! He’d go down in history for this achievement, but when he lands on the planet he encounters a problem... He’s as small as a penny. And everybody’s gone. And it’s the ’90s.

As Milo, players will explore a giant house, using Tinykin to maneuver through an oversized world by building ladders, bridges, carrying objects, and more. Milo can also jump, skate, and grind, as you can see in the game’s debut trailer above.
Tinykin is coming to Windows PC and unannounced consoles next year. Developer Splashteam is composed of ex-Ubisoft developers who have worked on the Rayman and Rabbids franchises.]]></summary>

The game won’t be free-to-play after all
 Icarus, the next game from DayZ creator Dean Hall’s Rocketwerkz studio, launches on Steam Aug. 11. In a surprise announcement, the session-based multiplayer survival game will not be free-to-play. Instead the game will cost $29.99, and will be released in chapters. The announcement was made Sunday during the PC Gaming Show presentation, and was accompanied by a new trailer.
“We didn’t want the business model to get in the way of the game experience,” Hall said in a news release. “We also heard loud and clear from our community that they wanted to avoid the pitfalls of free-to-play. We want Icarus to continually evolve as a living game, always adding new session challenges and game modes. We think regular chapters and content updates are a great way to deliver.” 
Icarus puts players in the role of pioneering explorers trying to tame a wild, alien world. The session-based gameplay puts a time limit on each mission, challenging players to gather resources before their ship back to orbit leaves them behind. You can read more, including an interview with Dean Hall, in our hands-on preview. 
A deluxe edition, which will include two follow-on chapters of downloadable content, will also be available for $99.95.]]></summary>

 Starfield is the next large-scale, AAA role-playing game from Fallout and Skyrim makers Bethesda Game Studios. It will launch Nov. 11, 2022. The spacefaring RPG, first teased in 2018, is Bethesda’s biggest all-new video game world in the past 25 years. Here’s what we know about it, so far.
WHAT IS STARFIELD?
“Skyrim in space,” Todd Howard told The Washington Post. Howard is the executive producer for Bethesda Game Studios and the creative leader of its Elder Scrolls franchise since 2000. In other words, this is the full-featured Bethesda Game Studios RPG experience, seen in games like The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and Fallout 5, just applied to an all-new, science fiction setting.

Square Enix is going full character action with a new Final Fantasy spinoff
 Ninja Gaiden and Nioh developer Team Ninja is making a new Final Fantasy spinoff game for Square Enix. Titled Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin and pitched as “a bold new vision for Final Fantasy,” the game is scheduled to launch in 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is being developed by Final Fantasy veterans Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima in conjunction with Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo Games.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin appears heavy on action. In the game’s E3 2021 reveal trailer, we see a trio of Warriors of Light battling a variety of creatures and enemies, and, ultimately, the evil knight Garland from the original Final Fantasy. Square Enix’s official description of the game reads: “Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine. Yet doubts remain—are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?”
A trial version of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is available now from the PlayStation Store. It will be available on PlayStation 5 through June 24.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.]]></summary>

From Deck Nine, True Colors is out in September
 Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine revealed more information about the game’s empathy mechanic in a presentation during publisher Square Enix’s E3 presentation Sunday. The next Life is Strange game, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 10, is about a 21-year-old Asian American woman named Alex Chen who moves to Colorado to reunite with her brother Gabe. When her brother mysteriously dies, Alex uses her supernatural power, Empathy, to find out what happened in the quiet mountain town.
The clip shows that Alex has long struggled with these powers; she calls them a curse rather than a gift, oftentimes becoming overwhelmed by others’ feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. Over the course of t…]]></summary>

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The trailer page says War for Wakanda will launch in August of this year.]]></summary>

 Years after Eidos-Montréal’s Guardians of the Galaxy game was leaked in 2017, the Deus Ex developer is finally ready to show it off.

Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 26.
The game draws from existing lore — the movies and comic books — but is a new interpretation of the gang. This is not a movie adaptation, which is quickly noticeable once you’ve se…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed iOS 15, which is available now in beta for developers ahead of a public release later this year. One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.



MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:

Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally 🎉 #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq
— Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021
 
Cross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.



From the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:
Drag and drop

With support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.
To drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.



In many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that's dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.



The first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.

Devolver Forwarder promises wackiness
 Publisher Devolver Digital brings its singular brand of video game publisher zaniness to E3 2021 (or at least close to it) with a new livestream on Saturday, June 12. Dubbed the Devolver MaxPass+ stream, the event promises new looks at upcoming games, including gameplay for Shadow Warrior 3 and Death’s Door.
Devolver MaxPass+ (aka Devolver Forwarder) kicks off at 4:30 p.m. EDT/1:30 p.m. PDT, and will stream on Twitch. Devolver Digital promises five new game reveals from its stable of developers including Flying Wild Hog, Galvanic Games, and Doinksoft, as well as release date announcements for Phantom Abyss and Death’s Door.

New Avatar game set for 2022 release
 Ubisoft has unveiled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a first-person action-adventure game set in James Cameron’s Avatar universe. A new trailer highlighted the game’s central conflict, focusing on air-to-air combat between humans and the Na’vi.
First announced in February 2017, we now know the game has been built on Ubisoft’s proprietary Snowdrop Engine — the same technology that underpins The Division. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, in partnership with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney itself.
“In this new, standalone story,” Ubisoft says in the game’s description, “play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back on the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.”

The Siege of Paris follows Wrath of the Druids
 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s developers have post-launch support planned “well into” the game’s second year. Highlights, announced during the Ubisoft Forward livestream on Saturday, include a story expansion called The Siege of Paris, and an educational Discovery Tour mode similar to the ones made for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey.
Ubisoft did not give a specific launch date for The Siege of Paris, other than to say it would arrive this summer. The game’s first premium expansion, The Wrath of the Druids, just launched in May. That chapter took place in Ireland; this one takes players to France for “the most ambitious battle in Viking history,” Ubisoft’s Karen Lee told viewers. 
The Siege of Paris is premium content, and will be available a la carte or with the game’s Season Pass. The new chapter also brings back “black box” missions, in which the player is given only a single infiltration objective. How they complete the task is entirely up to them.
The Viking Age Discovery Tour, like its two predecessors, will be a free update to all with the game. It’s a combat-free exploration mode and, like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s tour, it will allow users to create and pursue role-playing missions for the world’s inhabitants.
Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla launched in November on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna services.]]></summary>

Siege is also getting a new Operator called Thunderbird
 Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer shooters around on both console and PC and it’s finally getting cross-play ... but with some caveats. The announcement  came at Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation on Saturday.
On June 30, Ubisoft will add cross-play and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege between all of its various PC platforms including standard PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna. Players from all three platforms will be able to queue into games together. For consoles, cross-play will be released in early 2022, when players on PlayStation and Xbox will be able to jump into games together. It does not appear that Ubisoft will let PC and console players compete together, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise.

According to Ubisoft’s announcement, these updates will also include cross-progression across “all platforms” as part of one unified account, so you can earn rewards no matter where you’re playing. 


Right after the announcement of cross-play and cross-progression, Ubisoft also gave fans a new look at the game’s newest Defensive Operator, Thunderbird. The Thunderbird preview came in the form of an gorgeous animated trailer where the new Operator takes on a bear with a flare gun and lives to tell the tale. 
Thunderbird will be available as part of Siege’s North Star update and event, which starts next week on June 14.]]></summary>

Ubisoft announces Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph as playable characters
 Far Cry 6’s season pass will add three villains from previous Far Cry games as playable characters, Ubisoft announced at its E3 2021 press conference Saturday. As seen in the trailer above, Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3, Pagan Min from Far Cry 4, and Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5 will be playable characters in post-release content for Far Cry 6.
The content appears dreamlike or hallucinogenic in nature, giving Ubisoft a narrative out for its Far Cry 6 DLC. Not that it’s ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5’s post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.
The season pass content also includes Far Cry 3’s DLC Blood Dragon.
The revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, “Vaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me. I still get recognized as Vaas, and I still feel the outpouring of love for that character - makes me very happy. Who knows... maybe I will reprise the role very soon?”
Far Cry 6, by Ubisoft Toronto, launches Oct. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna platforms. The game stars Giancarlo Esposito as the primary antagonist; he is El Presidente, Anton Castillo, the autocratic ruler determined to crush an uprising bent on regime change. Our preview from two weeks ago has more.
Update: This story has been updated with confirmation from Ubisoft.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Platforms State of the Union at WWDC this week, Apple unveiled a new API for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 that enables developers to implement an on-screen virtual game controller in their iPhone and iPad games with just a few lines of code.





While many iPhone and iPad games already offer on-screen controls, Apple's new virtual game controller is available to all developers, easy to add, and can be customized on a per-game basis. Apple said the on-screen controller can be adjusted to a variety of layouts, with up to four buttons and a thumbstick, d-pad, or touchpad available per left and right side.



"These new on-screen controls for iPhone and iPad look amazing, and they're carefully tuned for grip locations across hand sizes and for a great responsiveness and feel," said Nat Brown, an Apple engineer working on Game Technologies.



Apple offers a WWDC session and developer documentation with more details.

Season Pass owners can add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec cells
 Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline, the story expansion for those who bought the game’s premium season pass, will launch July 6, Ubisoft said on Saturday. The story brings back Aiden Pearce from the first Watch Dogs and Wrench from the second as playable characters.
Pearce, according to Ubisoft’s news release, has come to London to reconnect with his nephew, Jackson. He’s supposed to infiltrate a Broca Tech lab and steal some cutting edge technology — but Wrench gets the device first and flees. With his job botched, Pearce and his nephew are now on the lam from those who hired him.
Ubisoft’s statement says Bloodline is a prequel to the main campaign of Watch Dogs: Legion. It will also offer several side quests for both characters to complete.
Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline is available a la carte for $14.99 to those without the Season Pass. The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn’t get it with one of two premium editions in the game’s October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.
Watch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon’s Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.
Post-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.]]></summary>

Tactical alien action with Rainbow Six operators
 Rainbow Six is getting back to its tactical co-op roots, sort of. The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game’s latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation. 
The trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. 


Rainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege’s Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies — instead of the series’ usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020’s pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. 
Just like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series’ tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down — or escape from — infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege — including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  
Rainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.]]></summary>

Gearbox has Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands movie, and more in store
 Borderlands developer Gearbox Software is heading to E3 2021 armed with a new game, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands — the high-fantasy spinoff of its shooter-looter series — and a new movie. Gearbox fans expect to hear more about Borderlands — the Eli Roth-directed movie starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Jamie Lee Curtis — during its E3 Showcase on Saturday.
Gearbox Entertainment will take over the official E3 2021 livestream on Saturday, June 12 at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT. The event, which is expected to run about 30 minutes, will stream on E3’s YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter channels.
Beyond Wonderlands and Borderlands, don’t be surprised if a few Gearbox Publishing titles also get some attention during Gearbox’s E3 showcase. Norsfell and Gearbox announced earlier this week that co-op action survival RPG Tribes of Midgard will launch July 27 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam.

Registration for PC beta begins today
 Ubisoft’s 10-year-old Rocksmith franchise will become an “interactive music learning subscription service,” with its next entry, Rocksmith Plus. That’s according to an email that guitar maker Gibson let slip before Ubisoft could announce the video game at its E3 keynote on Saturday.
Per the marketing email, Ubisoft is apparently partnering with Gibson again, as the company’s Epiphone, Kramer, and Gibson models of acoustic, electric, or bass guitars are specifically mentioned as compatible. A closed beta on PC will also begin soon, with registration open today.

      A gif included with the email Gibson sent today.
  
Newcomers and returning musicians will find “an expansive library” of songs in Rocksmith Plus’s catalog. The program’s Riff Repeater, which can control a song’s speed to help players practice, also returns.
The first Rocksmith launched in 2011 but only for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That was followed two years later by Rocksmith 2014, considered a replacement rather than a sequel. That game launched for PC platforms in addition to the two consoles, and their successors.
Rocksmith 2014’s song library included 66 playable tracks on the disc, with more available as downloadable content. Saturday’s email did not specify how many songs would be available with the base game, or how deep the subscription service runs, or its pricing, for that matter.
Update: Ubisoft formally announced Rocksmith Plus at Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward event. The game still does not have a release date. During a presentation, Ubisoft said Rocksmith Plus players will also be able to use something called Rocksmith Workshop to create and add their own guitar arrangements to the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a currently unlisted ad on YouTube, Apple is promoting the versatility, portability, and power of the M1 iPad Pro in a fun musical inspired by The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World" soundtrack.






In the ad, which features the main character using an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil, multiple users can be seen struggling with their old PCs indoors while hoping that they can someday use an ‌iPad Pro‌ instead. The lyrics and soundtrack of the ad are completely based around The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World," but the visuals tell the majority of the story.



In one scene, an office employee using an old Windows PC can be seen looking out at a girl using an ‌iPad Pro‌ with the Magic Keyboard in a park while singing "up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun." The ad ends with all the characters singing "wish I could be, part of that world," referencing the world of using an ‌iPad Pro‌. 



The ad, uploaded on June 4, is currently unlisted on YouTube, meaning only those with a link will be able to watch it. It's unclear why Apple has decided not to make it public or if it plans to in the near future.

Halo, Starfield, Fable, and Game Pass news
 Microsoft’s E3 2021 press conference — called the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase — has a lot of ground to cover on June 13. The company has more to reveal for long-delayed Halo Infinite, including hopefully a finalized release date. It will also likely have updates to the Fable and Forza franchises, and Rare will likely have updates to Sea of Thieves and hopefully more to say on its mystical title Everwild. 
The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will stream on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and last for about 90 minutes. 
This is the first E3 since Microsoft acquired Bethesda, so the publisher and its studios will also take part in the press conference. Expect updates on long-awaited Starfield, and maybe a better look at The Elder Scrolls 6. Bethesda also promised updates to Fallout 76. 
Ahead of E3, Microsoft revealed plans to bring Xbox Game Pass and streaming games to internet-capable TVs and other stand-alone platforms, as well as bringing cloud based gaming to iOS devices. Microsoft also committed to bring at least one new first-party Xbox Game Studios game to Game Pass every quarter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.





In line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with "dramatically improved" speakers.



According to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.





The report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.



Prosser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.

These measures are the culmination of a 16-month antitrust investigation into tech companies practices that kicked off in 2019, and which saw Apple CEO Tim Cook testify in an antitrust hearing alongside Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.



At the conclusion of that hearing, which took place in July 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee leading the inquiry released a 450 page report with recommendations that have turned into the new antitrust bills that were proposed today.

Apple told Engadget the feature will work with stereo, 5.1, 7.1
and Dolby Atmos content. Whether you’re using a pair of AirPods
Pro or AirPods Max, the software that powers the feature will
widen the soundstage so that it seems like the entire room you’re
in is being filled with sound. When you sit down to watch a movie
or TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after
it detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while.
Once you get up to walk around, it will reactivate. Connecting
your AirPods to an Apple TV is also easy in this context. When
you’re near the device with your headphones, it will display a
popup that will allow you to quickly connect, and you won’t need
to dig into the settings menu.

Kena blends multiple genres into something new
 Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the first game from new studio Ember Lab. Its first trailer made it look like a cute romp through a forest overtaken by darkness, but after spending over an hour with a hands-on demo of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, I’ve learned it’s surprisingly difficult. Kena may look like the latest from Pixar, but the final mini-boss I encountered kicked my ass up, down, and sideways.
Kena: Bridge of Spirits has layers to it — some cute, others tough — and it made for a fun preview full of surprises.

Due to the global health crisis, Apple has held its typically in-person Worldwide Developers Conference in an all-digital format for the past two years. The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.



Unlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. 



One of the questions as part of this year's end of WWDC survey reads, "How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?" 



While not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community's outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple is contemplating the idea, and does plan to hold its first in-person event since the global health crisis began in the coming months.

 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week.

3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock)
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. 
Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

I am Magneto, and I would like to register a complaint. Frankly,
all of these new mutants are terrible. […]
I met the people who were saying that metal objects now stuck to
them because of their vaccines and gave them a whole recruitment
speech about how they were the next stage in evolution, but once I
said the word “evolution,” they looked at me doubtfully. Then I
asked them to show off their abilities, and — I hate to say this
but, have you ever been at a friend’s amateur magic show, where
the magic show is not going quite as was hoped, and there’s a lot
of saying “hold on” and “wait, hang on” and “sorry” as they fail
several times running to identify your card, and then a dead bird
falls unprompted out of someone’s hat? Frankly, that would have
been an improvement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of neglect, Adobe is removing its free "Photoshop Mix" and "Photoshop Fix" apps from the App Store on June 21, 2021.





Adobe made the announcement in an update to its FAQ page for each of the apps. On the pages, Adobe says that both apps will be removed from the App Store on June 21, and advises users who used the apps to switch to using its "Photoshop Express Photo Editor," which requires either a monthly or yearly subscription for deeper photo editing.



Photoshop Mix was released on the App Store prior to when a fully-fledged version of Photoshop arrived on the iPad. It was Adobe's attempt to offer iPad users at the time some level of photo editing capabilities on the go. The app allows users to add text layers and "easily create and share professional multilayered images and designs in minutes." Photoshop Fix, on the other hand, is more tailored towards light touch-ups and refinements.



Photoshop Mix was last updated three years ago, while Photoshop Fix was updated two years with support for the iPhone X and newer screen ratio. Both apps will remain available for download on the App Store until June 21.

        <updated>2021-06-11T17:04:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times:
As the Justice Department investigated who was behind leaks of
classified information early in the Trump administration, it took
a highly unusual step: Prosecutors subpoenaed Apple for data from
the accounts of at least two Democrats on the House Intelligence
Committee, aides and family members. One was a minor.
All told, the records of at least a dozen people tied to the
committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018, including those of
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, then the panel’s top
Democrat and now its chairman, according to committee officials
and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric
Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he
had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed. […]
Moreover, just as it did in investigating news organizations,
the Justice Department secured a gag order on Apple that expired
this year, according to a person familiar with the inquiry, so
lawmakers did not know they were being investigated until Apple
informed them last month.
Adam Schiff:
Trump repeatedly demanded the DOJ go after his political enemies.
It’s clear his demands didn’t fall on deaf ears.
This baseless investigation, while now closed, is yet another
example of Trump’s corrupt weaponization of justice.
And how much he imperiled our democracy.

Apple Tower Theatre is the first retail store in downtown Los Angeles, and it's located in L.A.'s historic Broadway Theater District. This location was the city's retail hub for the first half of the twentieth century, and is now home to a dozen theater locations.

Another Eklund to the Flyers?
 William Eklund is clearly head and shoulders above the other first round European prospects.
Playing in the SHL full time this past season (he played 20 SHL games in 2019-20), Eklund outpaced 2020 first round picks Alexander Holtz (who is also his teammate, and in fact, linemate) and Lucas Raymond, and delivered a solid postseason performance. Many consider Eklund to be the most skilled forward in terms of raw ability in the draft, and given my personal propensity to favor European prospects from men’s leagues, I would have to agree.

Ceramics will have their revenge
 FromSoftware’s Elden Ring finally came out of hiding on Thursday, after two years of deafening silence about the new adventure from Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin. It looked spectacular, in a next-gen Dark Souls kind of way, with its gigantic lightning-chucking dragons, double-jumping horses, a spider made of fingers, a brand-new Tall Lady to obsess over, and, of course, those pots.
Oh, those pots.
Elden Ring’s first gameplay trailer barely hinted at the existence of anthropomorphic pots, but they’ve becoming a quiet sensation since they were revealed. It seems everyone — there are dozens of us! — loves the little pot with arms and legs, and the slightly larger pot with arms and legs. In case you blacked …]]></summary>

One team’s questionable player is another team’s gold?
 The Flyers are in a precarious position heading into the offseason. As a team in need of significant changes while working with limited cap space, producing trades, handling free agency, and running the expansion draft in a way that will regain the confidence of the less than magnanimous fanbase won’t be easy. The aforementioned salary squeeze will make adding multiple no-brainer plugs for the gaps on this roster nearly impossible, so Chucky Two-Trades would be wise to pursue players that are underrated by the rest of the league. Whether that be to simply restructure the team’s salary or to provide cheap depth that’ll free up room to add a star is up to him.
With that in mind, below are som…]]></summary>

Security breach was reportedly performed via EA’s Slack
 A group of hackers has said they’ve broken into The Sims 4 and FIFA publisher Electronic Arts’ internal systems, according to a report from Vice. Hackers reportedly stole FIFA 21 source code — for the game and its matchmaking components — as well as source code for EA’s Frostbite engine.
A total of 780 GB of data stolen was stolen, Vice reported, including “proprietary EA frameworks and software development kits.” Hackers provided Vice with documents reportedly stolen in the hack, with information on PlayStation VR and other development tools.
“We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,” an EA representative told Vice. “No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident, we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation.”
Hackers reportedly accessed EA’s internal systems through workplace chat platform Slack, which plenty of companies use for online communication. The hackers told Vice they obtained access to an EA Slack channel using “stolen cookies” sold online for $10. (Cookies can be used to access login details.)
The hackers said they contacted an EA IT support person via Slack for a “multifactor authentication token” — claiming they’d lost their phone — to login to EA’s network. The hackers provided Vice with screenshots of the steps taken in accessing the information; Vice later confirmed the details of the hack with EA.
Contents of the hack have not been released online, at least just yet. Vice reported that the hackers are looking to sell the data.
EA has not responded to Polygon’s request for more information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple revealed that newer Macs will be gaining support for Adaptive-Sync external displays with variable refresh rates in macOS Monterey.





Apple says Adaptive-Sync displays will be supported on any Mac with Apple silicon, like the M1 chip, as well as "many" recent Intel-based Macs. When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences > Displays.



Adaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.



Macs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.

How the 21-year-old forward rose above expectations in a year of disappointments for the Flyers.
 After spending most of his draft plus two season playing in the NHL during the 2019-20 campaign, Joel Farabee broke out in a big way offensively for the Flyers in his 2021 sophomore campaign. To put it simply, Farabee was one of the best goal scorers in the NHL this season, and he just turned 21 at the end of February. 
Farabee led the Flyers in goal-scoring with 20, tying him for 30th league wide, equal to players like Nathan MacKinnon and David Pastrnak. Even more impressive is that 16 of those goals occurred at even strength, tying him for 6th in the league with Alex DeBrincat, Brad Marchand, Kirill Kaprizov, and Kyle Connor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Tech Support series, Wired had Yo-Yo Ma answer some questions about the cello and music sent in by Twitter users. What I like about this is that no critic or professional interviewer would ask these questions (they are “bad” interview questions) and yet Ma answers them all generously and thoughtfully. It reminds me a little bit of when Vogue trained an AI program to interview Billie Eilish:
What I really loved hearing Billie say was that human interviewers often ask the same questions over and over, and she appreciated that the AI questions don’t have an agenda in the same way, they’re not trying to get anything from her.


Perhaps with interesting subjects who are game, having “good” interview questions maybe isn’t that important, particularly if they are repeated queried about the same topics in every interview.

Koch Media unveils new publishing label
 The next Payday game from Starbreeze Studios and a brand-new Painkiller are coming from a newly announced game publishing label called Prime Matter. Koch Media, which also owns publishing labels Deep Silver, Milestone, and Ravenscourt, announced Prime Matter on Thursday, revealing its first slate of games.
Koch Media calls Prime Matter a “premium label” that’s “dedicated to delivering brilliant immersive games.” That includes soon-to-be-released titles like Encased from Dark Crystal Games and King’s Bounty 2 by 1C Entertainment, both of which are due in the coming months. Then there are games that won’t be out for years, including Payday 3 and a new Painkiller game from Saber Interactive. 
In between, Prime Matter will publish Crossfire: Legion, a new real-time strategy game from Blackbird Interactive based on Smilegate’s Crossfire shooter series; GunGrave GORE, developer Iggymob’s anime-inspired third-person action shooter; and Kingdom Come Deliverance for Nintendo Switch. 
Prime Matter will also publish dark sci-fi action adventure Scars Above, futuristic FPS Codename Final Form, Lovecraftian horror action RPG Dolmen, Middle Ages-era action RPG The Last Oricru, story-driven fantasy adventure Echoes Of The End, and psychedelic horror adventure The Chant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Safari has been completely redesigned with easier-to-reach controls in mind. Foremost is a new, compact tab bar that floats at the bottom of the screen when you're not inputting a URL address. Safari on iOS has also inherited the Start Page from macOS Big Sur, and you can now create tab groups to allow you to easily access them across devices. Let's take a closer look at how it all fits together.





The Start Page


First seen in macOS Big Sur, Safari's redesigned Start Page is where your Bookmarks, Favorites, Frequently Visited sites, Siri Suggestions, iCloud Tabs, Reading List, and Privacy Report all live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, Apple is expanding the features built into the stock Reminders app, which received a major overhaul in 2019. With the new updates shipping this fall, users will be able to create "Smart Lists" that corral reminders based on different filters, such as their location, due date, flag, priority, and more.





With the new functionality, users can create powerful lists that show reminders based only on several filters. For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.



For date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location. Users can also select the flag filter to show only flagged reminders and the priority filter.



‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and ‌macOS Monterey‌ are all currently in beta testing for members of the Apple Developer Program, with public beta versions set to be released soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has begun testing a major redesign to the iCloud Mail experience on the web, bringing its webmail service more in line with recent design changes made in macOS Big Sur.





The new design, currently in beta, reported first by 9to5mac, features a cleaner overall design and feel than the current public experience of ‌iCloud‌ Mail for the web. The current, soon-to-be previous version features thin typography, lighter colors, and design elements from iOS 7. Additionally, the new design allows users to compose emails in a smaller window in the middle of the screen, compared to opening an entirely new window.



As the new design is in beta testing alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS Monterey, and tvOS 15, it will likely be made available for all ‌iCloud‌ web users later this fall. Users wanting to try the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design can check out the beta website for iCloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nashville Chatter Class has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database pointing towards several unreleased iPhone 13 models that Apple will be launching in the fall.





Versions of iPhone running iOS 14 are listed with the model numbers A2628, A2630, A2634, A2635, A2640, A2643, and A2645. None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.



The EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.



Apple's 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end "Pro" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.



Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. See our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple is introducing a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera's viewfinder or in a photo you've taken and let you perform several actions with it. 





For example, Live Text allows you to capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call, or look up a location name in Maps to get directions. It also incorporates optical character recognition, so you can search for a picture of a handwritten note in your photos and save it as text. 



Live Text's content awareness extends to everything from QR codes to emails that appear in pictures, and this on-device intelligence feeds into Siri suggestions, too. 





For instance, if you take a picture that shows an email address and then open the Mail app …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook has announced new features for its Messenger app, including a quick reply bar, QR codes, and new chat themes.





The new quick reply bar can be found in the Messenger media viewer, and aims to make it easier to chat about media posted by friends without needing to go back to the main chat thread.



Users can tap on a photo or video and send a response via the quick reply bar, which lives at the bottom of the screen, then swipe up to exit the fullscreen media viewer to return to the main chat thread.





Three new chat themes, which are available in both Messenger and Instagram in chat settings, let users add new twists to their chat thread backgrounds. The themes include Olivia Rodrdigo, World Oceans Day, and F9: Fast and Furious.



In addition, Facebook is adding QR codes and payment links for use with Facebook Pay, allowing users to make payments even if they're not on Facebook. 





To access a personal QR code and payment link, go to Messenger settings and tap "Facebook Pay." Users can share the payment link or allow friends to scan the QR code to send or request money.



The new features are rolling out now to Facebook Messenger, which is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

addressed them in a reply to John Siracusa on Twitter.
Thankfully, HBO has now issued a software update that reverts the
playback UI to the original tvOS version. I’ve verified this in
the 50.30.2 update and can confirm everything is back to normal
from skipping ahead to asking Siri ‘What did they say?’ and
everything in between.
You make a mistake, you fix it as fast as you can. Kudos, HBO Max tvOS team. 
Someone should send this to the new team behind the MLB app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At TED2020, Ethan Hawke gave a remote talk about the benefits of being creative. As someone who often struggles to find meaning in whatever it is I do here, this bit was especially good to hear:
Do you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?”
Or the inverse — something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance. We need it.

Kranz founded Canoo, a self-driving car startup that he left earlier this year. Prior to creating Canoo, Kranz helped to develop the i3 and i8 vehicles at BMW, where he was employed for 30 years.



According to Bloomberg, Kranz's hiring is a sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving vehicle that will rival Tesla. Kranz will report to Apple Car lead Doug Fields, who works under AI chief John Giannandrea.



Rumors about Apple's car project have picked up in recent months as Apple now appears to be looking for suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop the vehicle. There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai's Kia division, but it's not clear if that relationship has progressed.



Development on the ‌Apple Car‌ remains in the early stages, and Bloomberg suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.

Fight Deadites with three friends (and one frenemy)
 On Thursday at the Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at the gameplay of Evil Dead: The Game, an upcoming co-op shooter. Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.
One player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they’re tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It’ll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it’s controlled by a skilled player.
While moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It’ll also be necessary to actively manage your player character’s fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.
Evil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:
On the macOS Monterey features page, fine print indicates
that the following features require a Mac with the M1 chip,
including any MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac
model released since November 2020:
Portrait Mode blurred backgrounds in FaceTime videos
Live Text for copying and pasting, looking up, or translating
text within photos
An interactive 3D globe of Earth in the Maps app
More detailed maps in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles,
New York, and London in the Maps app
Text-to-speech in more languages, including Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian, and Finnish
On-device keyboard dictation that performs all processing
completely offline
Unlimited keyboard dictation (previously limited to 60 seconds
per instance)
Apple has not explained why any of these features are not
available on Intel-based Macs. For what it’s worth, Google Earth
has long offered an interactive 3D globe of the Earth on
Intel-based Macs both on the web and in an app.
I don’t think Apple has to explain. These features all clearly are built on code that uses features exclusive to Apple Silicon. E.g. for Portrait Mode in FaceTime, it uses the M1 imaging pipeline — the same thing that makes all FaceTime footage on the M1 MacBooks look so much better than on any Intel MacBook, even though the camera hardware is the same. The speech/dictation features on this list are surely using the Neural Engine, something Intel Macs don’t even have.

The trailer shows a tragic backdrop to a tranquil scene
 Planet of Lana is a beautiful new cinematic puzzle adventure game from the Swedish indie studio, Wishfully. It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.
The story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana’s sister. Their planet — which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature — has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.
What’s interesting though, is that this game expressly isn’t about war or conflict. “This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet –and the journey to keep it that way,” a description from the developers said. 
The world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. 
A release shared that the visual style “combines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.” The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, “allowing its incredible artwork to come to life.”
In the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There’s a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. 
However, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It’s a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. 
Planet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.]]></summary>

FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022
 Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.
The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.
Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses!
Check out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.


The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.
Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.”
FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.
Elden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good overview of one of this week’s biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:
Apple’s iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it
routes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address
from the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever
manages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is
generally just one server between you and the website you’re
visiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ↔︎ VPN
Server ↔︎ Website. Private Relay adds another server to the
mix, which ensures that no one in the chain — not even Apple — can see the whole picture: You ↔︎ Apple’s Ingress Server ↔︎
Content Provider’s Egress Server ↔︎ Website.
This is, as Apple calls it in their “Get Ready for iCloud Private
Relay” WWDC Session on the topic, “Privacy by Design.”
Apple made specific mention that while the “Ingress Proxy” servers
are run by Apple, the “Egress Proxy” (aka the server which
communicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by
Apple and is under the control of “a (trusted) content provider”.
This means that Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting,
and the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.
I’m using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn’t seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail’s new tracker privacy protection), even though I’ve got an Apple One family account. I “fixed” that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1 — just figured I’d mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.

Less Masquerade, more mass murdering
 Developer Sharkmob is creating a new game in the Vampire: the Masquerade universe, but it’s a far cry from the dialogue-heavy RPGs that are common to the franchise. Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.
We saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. 
There’s an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.
Bloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021. Players can sign up for a closed alpha test on the game’s official website.]]></summary>

‘We cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with’
 CD Projekt, the parent company of the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, announced Thursday that the data breach it suffered earlier this year is potentially more damaging than originally thought. The news was announced during the high-profile industry premieres showcased during the Summer Game Fest, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
In early February CD Project announced that it was targeted by a “cyber attack” and that data, including video game source code, had been stolen. At the time, the Polish company said that “certain data” was being ransomed by unknown parties. It did not confirm the type of data stolen.

 At Summer Game Fest on Thursday, actor Jeff Goldblum announced Frontier’s newest game, Jurassic World Evolution 2.

Goldblum had the honor of announcing the release, since he will play Dr. Ian Malcolm in the upcoming game, and has played Dr. Malcolm in the Jurassic Park film canon, and in games like The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

Plus, two new roles: the Sherriff and the Scientist
 Among Us’ next update got partially revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream on Thursday, and it includes a new map, new colors and cosmetics, new roles, and a Hide and Seek mode. There’s no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.
The new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We’ll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.
There are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.
Among Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It’s a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it’s still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.]]></summary>

Caught in between are the scavs, a lightly armed group of civilians fighting for survival.

The new trailer also teases another update for Verdansk
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting another new season, but there won’t be a whole new map this time. We got a preview of the season’s changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.
The largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. 
Meanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what’s next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn’t clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. 
Call of Duty: Warzone’s previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo. While this patch certainly seems to be smaller than that, it does seem like it will have plenty of new additions to the game for players to check out over the next few months. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone season 4 will start on June 17.]]></summary>

Tracking pixels are hidden graphics that you might not see in an email, but your email client loads them, allowing senders to gather data from you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I learned about bonsai trees as a kid, I’ve been fascinated with them. In my 20s, my girlfriend bought me a juniper bonsai for my birthday. I was really excited to see what I could do with it, but it was dead in a month and a half, forever dimming my enthusiasm for ever practicing bonsai myself. But I still love observing the process and seeing the results, so I’ve enjoyed watching Bucky Barnes’1 Bonsai Releaf videos. His latest video (above) documents the year-long transformation of a Japanese larch tree he purchased for £30 into something that looks like it’s been majestically clinging to a windswept cliff for hundreds of years.
Observation, healing, experimentation, growth, making irreversible choices — so many lovely little themes, lessons, and moments in this video. At one point, well into the process, he clips off most of a long branch and I exclaimed “Oh my God!” out loud. I guess I still need to work on letting go of attachments.

No, not that one.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced that following beta testing for a small group of users, it plans to launch its xCloud game streaming service on Apple devices via Safari "in the next few weeks."





Microsoft has been attempting to launch its game streaming service, which allows users to stream games from the cloud rather than store them locally on the device, on Apple's platforms for some time. Microsoft and Apple got into a heated public argument last year over App Store guidelines that rejected apps such as xCloud from being available on the ‌App Store‌. Apple eventually changed the policy, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. 



Microsoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on iPhone and iPad. Alongside xCloud on Safari, the streaming service will also launch on Edge and Chrome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One small but useful new feature introduced in iOS 15 is the ability for customers to request refunds for in-app purchases directly within an app, rather than having to use the Report a Problem page on Apple's website.





Apple has introduced a new StoreKit API that allows developers to implement a "Request a Refund" option within their apps. Users can tap on this option, select a specific in-app purchase, identify the issue that prompted the refund request, and tap the Request Refund button. Once the request is submitted, customers will receive an email from Apple with an update on the status of their refund within 48 hours.



When requesting a refund within an app, customers still have the option to visit the Report a Problem page on Apple's website to check the status of claims.



‌iOS 15‌ is available now in beta for developers, and will be publicly released in the fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On iOS and iPadOS 15, Apple is adding new functionality to WidgetKit, introduced last year, that will allow developers to classify information deemed as sensitive in their widgets, meaning that specific information will only become viewable on the lock screen when the user unlocks their device.





iOS 14 introduced completely redesigned ‌widgets‌ for the lock screen and Home Screen. While there are no major changes to WidgetKit this year, the new password-protected feature may be welcomed by apps that feature ‌widgets‌ with sensitive information, such as health and banking information. Widgets are accessible on the lock screen by swiping left to Today View.



Related to ‌widgets‌ on iOS 15 is new functionality for Smart Stacks. Smart Stacks allows users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to be shown depending on factors such as time of day, location, and more. 



On ‌iOS 15‌, the system can now automatically add widgets to Smart Stacks that it believes are relevant. The feature called Widget Suggestions is a new way for users to discover ‌widgets‌ they may not have known existed. Developers interested in learning more about the changes in ‌iOS 15‌ can check out this WWDC session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Apple acquired the weather app Dark Sky, and shortly after its purchase, Apple shut down the app for Android. Despite the revamped iOS 15 Weather app taking heavy inspiration from Dark Sky, the weather's app standalone iOS app, web app, and API will remain available until the end of next year, compared to the end of this year, as previously planned.





Dark Sky announced in an update to its blog that "support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022," and that the iOS and web app will also remain available until the end of next year. Dark Sky had originally planned to shut down its web app alongside the closure of its Android application; however, that was delayed indefinitely.



A number of popular third-party iOS weather apps have relied on the Dark Sky API over the years, and those apps will be able to continue functioning through next year without needing to migrate to a new provider.



The revamped Weather app on iOS 15 includes several features in which Apple is taking clear inspiration and value from its Dark Sky purchase. Alongside a fresh new design, ‌iOS 15‌ includes live weather notifications, graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple introduced a new MailKit framework for macOS Monterey that enables developers to create Mail app extensions that block content, perform message and composing actions, and help with security.





There will be four main categories of Mail app extensions, according to Apple:
Compose: Extensions that provide new workflows when composing emails


Actions: Extensions that apply custom rules to incoming emails, such as an email being color coded, moved to a separate inbox, marked as read, or flagged


Content Blocking: Extensions that serve as WebKit content blockers for emails based on specific criteria in an email's HTML code


Message Security: Extensions that sign, encrypt, and decrypt emails when sending and receiving mail, with signed and encrypted icons below emails
Xcode 13, available in beta, includes a template for developers looking to create Mail app extensions on the Mac. The extensions can be built into existing Mac apps and can also be distributed through the Mac App Store, according to a WWDC session about MailKit, which is available on macOS only and not iOS or iPadOS.



In the WWDC session, Apple indicated that older Mail app plug-ins will stop functioning in an unspecified future macOS release.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July.

The new reminder, first spotted by The Verge, is part of a wider assortment of changes and new features coming to ‌FaceTime‌ with the release of ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this fall. Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.



Apple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, including those on Android and Windows, brand-new SharePlay functionality, and more.

A winger, at long last!
 As the draft board rolls on, we’ve finally got our first winger entering the mix, would you look at that!
It was something of a strange season for Guenther, in truth—because of COVID restrictions and the WHL starting their season late, he didn’t really play a whole lot. He started with Sherwood Park of the AJHL on a loan, got in four games with them before returning to Edmonton, and then played 12 games with them. It wasn’t a whole lot of playing time to work with, but Guenther sure made the most of it, cruising with a cool 2 points per game pace in the WHL, and that’s a performance that’s certainly turned a number of heads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple says that starting at a future date, it will offer members of the Apple Developer Program access to beta versions of AirPods Pro firmware updates before they're released and shipped to the public.





Apple made the announcement for developers on the downloads page where beta versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS are available. According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. 

Pre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date. This will allow development of features on iOS and macOS for AirPods as well as enable new features, including Conversation Boost (beam forming) and Ambient Noise Reduction (noise suppressor).
Currently, Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, and AirPods Max, although there's no reliable way to manually update the devices. Instead, they're updated automatically when connected to power and nearby a paired iPhone or iPad with an internet connection. 



It remains unclear how Apple will provide beta versions for ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware. Presumably, Apple will provide a profile for developers to download that automatically installs and updates the ‌AirPods Pro‌ when there's a new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today launched a promotion in Canada that offers a $75 Apple Store gift card with the purchase of a new iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini through June 28. The offer does not apply to the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max.





The offer is valid in Canada at physical Apple Store locations, through Apple's online store, in the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE for iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini purchases made between June 10 and June 28. Purchases made with carrier financing are eligible, with full terms and conditions outlined on Apple's website.



Apple's online store went down earlier today in Canada, likely in relation to this promotion launching. The offer does not appear to be available in the United States or other countries at this time, nor does it apply to any other products.



Apple released the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in October 2020, and introduced a purple color option for the devices in late April.

Users have always been able to locate their ‌AirPods‌ through the ‌Find My‌ app within Bluetooth range. Now, with ‌iOS 15‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ can tap into the ‌Find My‌ network to relay their approximate location, even if they're out of Bluetooth range from the owner. ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will still need to be within close proximity to a ‌Find My‌ device, such as an iPhone, however. 



‌Find My‌ allows devices to crowdsource the location of other ‌Find My‌ devices, meaning even if they're relatively far away, ‌Find My‌ should be able to provide an approximate location.

Use the ‌Find My‌ network to get an approximate location of your missing ‌AirPods Pro‌ or ‌AirPods Max‌. This will help you get within Bluetooth range so you can play a sound and locate them.
Beats headphones, also owned by Apple, added support for ‌Find My‌ earlier this year. ‌Find My‌ also gained other new features in ‌iOS 15‌, including brand new separation alerts that notify users if a ‌Find My‌ compatible device is left behind, a brand new Find My widget for the Home Screen, and the ability for ‌Find My‌ to locate an ‌iPhone‌ even if its low on battery, or completely turned off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.





Trump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.



However, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. 



Biden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.



Going forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an "evidence-based approach" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those "in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary."



A separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains "very concerned" about the data risks of TikTok users.



Biden's order says collecting of data from Americans "threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information," and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that "pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. 





The original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. 





Another interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. 



Along with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. 





The prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 in 2015.



We haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‌iPod touch‌ in the works. The current seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Heath, for The Verge:
Facebook is taking a novel approach to its first smartwatch, which the company hasn’t confirmed publicly but currently plans to debut next summer. The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, The Verge has learned.
A camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission.
Sounds right. A tiny concealable camera to take surreptitious photos that upload to Facebook sounds exactly like something Mark Zuckerberg came up with himself.

It’s from Robin Dunbar’s recent book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our Most Important Relationships. You might recall the author’s name from his concept of Dunbar’s number:1 that on average people can maintain about 150 friendships with others, a limit that is determined by human brain size and function. The chart is a more detailed version of the concept: it shows, roughly, the number of people we can have meaningful relationships with at various levels of intimacy. Dunbar explains in this Atlantic interview:
The innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your romantic relationships. The next layer of five is your shoulders-to-cry-on friendships. They are the ones who will drop everything to support us when our wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:
From its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America’s pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation’s top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic’s collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (“If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,” Walensky said.)


The pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that’ll change for the better in the future.

A Clarke! (but not that one).
 We’re closing out the top-3 in our draft board, and we’ve got another defenseman on deck!
Coming in at third overall is Brandt Clarke, and it’s been a bit of a weird year for him. Clarke played his 2019-20 season with the Barrie Colts of the OHL, but because of the COVID restrictions in Ontario, the OHL didn’t play a season at all this year. So, to make sure he was still able to get some games in, Clarke shipped off to Slovakia for 26 games with Nove Zamky. Unconventional? Yes. But it was a very good season, all the same.

        <updated>2021-06-09T13:40:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world’s best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double — that’s three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what’s going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air — like absurdly and spectacularly high — and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing — it’s like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.
In reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: “How is that even humanly possible?” As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.

this week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy doing these quick hits on CNBC. I get on, I get a few questions, I answer as best I can, and I’m out. Two tidbits on my spot today:
It seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is a new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.


Another question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:
One of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam
Levine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he
was like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song
and he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do
with this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this
evolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with
this, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to
do this.
So we went after the labels and are going to the artists and
educating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because
we have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a
simple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through
this software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This
requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit
back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the
right things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s
worth it. […]
To me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for
music what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch
television that’s not in HD?
One of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take
an old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on
low-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things
were recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back
to a lot of the songs and be able to do this.
The article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Circa 1842, ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige released an 11-print series revealing the secrets of shadow puppetry performances. From the description of one of these woodblock prints held in the collection at The Minneapolis Institute of Art:
As comic entertainment, shadow performances were among the many diversions, including music and dance, offered at teahouse parties during the Edo period. In the eleven-print series Improvised Shadow Performances, Hiroshige depicted figures making shadows on shōji screens by contorting their bodies. The images demonstrate how to create ingenious shadows and could easily have been used as a how-to guide for clever shadow making.


You can find more of Hiroshige’s shadow prints at Ukiyo-e.org. (via colossal)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jasmine Whitaker, writing for Adobe:
Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Illustrator and InDesign
will run natively on Apple Silicon devices. While users have been
able to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,
today’s development means a considerable boost in speed and
performance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent
increase in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent
improvement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.
Specific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster. Just from porting to run natively on Apple Silicon.
And we’ve only seen Apple’s consumer Apple Silicon chips for Mac.

A little more Wolverines love around here. 
 We’re rolling right along with our draft board, and coming in at second overall is another member of the University of Michigan’s stellar freshman class, in Matthew Beniers.
If you caught any of this year’s World Juniors, this is probably a name that you’re familiar with. Beniers picked up three points in seven games with the United States on their way to scooping up a goal medal, and while all eyes were on many of the big names on that team—2019 draftees like Cam York, Alex Turcotte, and Trevor Zegras—Beniers stood out for his motor that was helping to drive success for the US’s depth lines. 
His international success was just the cherry on top of a really solid season with Michigan, which saw him sco…]]></summary>

There’s a lot of directions the Flyers could go, which do you want to see them go in?
 Sign Dougie Hamilton? Trade for Seth Jones? Bring in some grit to the forward core? Blow up the core? Stand pat?  These are all options that have been floated around this team since it became obvious they were out of playoff contention. This is a huge off-season for Chuck Fletcher and the Philadelphia Flyers, who need to decide what they want this team to look like.
We as the fans need to know before games begin later this year to kick off the 2021-22 season, what is the Flyers identity? Before COVID shut the NHL season down in March 2020, the Flyers had a clear idea of what the team was. They were outstanding defensively, out-worked teams in the corne…]]></summary>
