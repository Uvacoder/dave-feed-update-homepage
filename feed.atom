Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Montreal Canadiens

explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google’s official YouTube blog:
Today, we’re introducing a new feature that gives you access to
YouTube TV from within the YouTube app, making it easier to enjoy
all the content you love. Existing members can easily access
YouTube TV by clicking on “Go to YouTube TV” in the main YouTube
app. This update will be available to all YouTube TV members on
Roku over the next few days, and we will expand to as many devices

I find weather apps to be an evergreen playground for design ideas — and that’s more true than ever now with iOS 14 widgets. One of my very favorites in recent years is Hello Weather.

Roku is alleging that Google is using the YouTube TV negotiations
to push it to enforce hardware requirements for future Roku
products that could make Roku devices more expensive. This
allegation bears some extra weight because of Google’s own
Chromecast TV streaming device, which is currently selling for $20

Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza
cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to
minuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the
public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from
