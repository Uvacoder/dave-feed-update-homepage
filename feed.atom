Finally, no more uncertainty.
 After a long, arduous battle over the stipulations of his new contract this offseason, Travis Sanheim finally agreed to a new contract with the Flyers: two years at a $4.675 million AAV. This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.


Sanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.

      Sanheim’s three year player card.
  
The Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:
Barring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That's the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can't fit 23 without moving somebody out.
— Charlie O'Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021



With the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.]]></summary>

Bungie won’t separate Destiny 2’s two main modes, and it’s starting to create problems
 Since the launch of Destiny 2, Bungie has struggled to maintain the balance between its PvE and PvP communities. The two camps have argued for years about whether Destiny should just be a PvE game or if it truly has room for competitive offerings. In the process, every player has lost out. Every time Bungie tries to make a new addition to the cooperative game, it’s hamstrung by multiplayer balancing — and vice versa.
Bungie’s devotion to both sides of the Destiny coin, while admirable, has resulted in an identity crisis. The studio likely won’t ever separate its PvP Crucible from its PvE cooperative activities. But if anything is clear, it’s that current attempts toward harmony a…]]></summary>

Other news this week included a fresh round of betas for iOS 15 and most of the associated operating system updates, reducing the update interval to one week as Apple finalizes things ahead of an expected September public launch.

The first update to Inazuma hits in September 
 Genshin Impact’s giant update, The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia, is getting more content on Sept. 1. 
The 2.1 update, “Floating World Under the Moonlight,” will bring the main storyline in Inazuma to a close, and add new characters, additional boss fights, and two new islands to explore. And fishing is coming to Teyvat. (Everybody’s doing it!)
Genshin Impact developer Mihoyo released a trailer teasing some of the 2.1 content on Friday. It showed combat gameplay from new characters and a cinematic of Scaramouche laughing maniacally as the Traveler falls to the ground and blacks out — suggesting some sort of confrontation between the two. 
The update will bring new playable characters, including fan favorite Raiden Shogun (the Electro Archon also known as Baal) and Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy. Aloy will join the Genshin Impact cast in the 2.1 update as a free five-star archer, but comes first to those with PlayStation consoles via early access. Aloy and Shogun will be joined by Sangonomiya Kokomi, a five-star who wields the power of Hydro and is a catalyst, and Kujou Sara, a ranged attacker with Electro attacks.  
As for fishing, Mihoyo said in a news release that “players can soon go angling for a variety of fishes across the continent of Teyvat,” which can be used to produce fish meat of exchange for rewards.]]></summary>

The announcement was made Friday in a video update by 343 Industries
 Halo Infinite won’t launch with two of the franchise’s most desirable features. Developers at 343 Industries said Friday that campaign co-op and the multiplayer map-editing Forge mode won’t be available when the game arrives. Forge in particular will lag behind “about six months.” The announcement was made on YouTube.
“Unfortunately as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,” Staten said, “and we also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.”
343 announced one year ago that Halo Infinite would miss its original 2020 launch window, delaying the game into 2021. It still has no firm release date. On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.
Staten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.
“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”
Co-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning. Forge mode, which allows players to build their own multiplayer levels and game modes and share them online, was introduced with Halo 3 in 2007.]]></summary>

Philadelphia has locked up an RFA for a couple of seasons.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to work through their depth this summer and most recently, have brought back a familiar face to keep that dearth of mid-20’s forwards active.
Announced by the team on Friday, the Flyers have re-signed center Connor Bunnaman to a two-year deal that will have a two-way salary structure for the first season to a one-way deal in the second. Other than a league-minimum NHL salary of $750,000, further financial details have not been disclosed by the club.

Loads of new changes and decisions in a staple mode don’t seem like a lot, until they do
 Every year, Madden NFL seems to have a glaringly neglected mode. The great news — the best news — about Madden NFL 22: That mode is Madden Ultimate Team.
For once, MUT is the mode that goes begging. For once, Madden Ultimate Team is the mode that gets a maintenance-level update from last year. Good! Madden lifers have long resented MUT, for all its microtransactions and monetization, accusing it of sucking up what little oxygen a year’s development cycle leaves, while core features and gameplay are left gasping and semi-conscious. But for Madden NFL 22, EA Tiburon stood pat on MUT, and that alone is a message to the community, just as much as the Franchise m…]]></summary>

Play on a selection of rotating maps in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Rotating Maps
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock class item)
5 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock helmet)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

 Destiny 2’s upcoming Season of the Lost will see some major weapon changes. Players will not only get their hands on non-Exotic Stasis weapons for the first time, they’ll also see unlimited ammo for primary weapons and a host of potent Exotic changes.
In a blog post ahead of its Destiny Showcase on Tuesday, where players will learn all about season 15 and next year’s The Witch Queen expansion, Bungie detailed those Stasis weapons. Legendary Stasis weapons will go in either the Power slot — reserved for rocket launchers, drum-fed grenade launchers, swords, linear fusion rifles, and machine guns — or the kinetic slot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula sold for $787,484 at auction this month after garnering 46 bids.





The 196 page manual was addressed to Julian Brewer, the son of Michael Brewer. Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. "Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980," read Jobs' note.
Julian recalls, "I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests. To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything, let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care."
RR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also auctioned off other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices. A Steve Jobs' letter that said "I'm afraid I don't sign autographs" sold for $479,939, and a NeXTSTEP software package sold for $210,325.





A functional Apple-1 computer previously owned by Roger Wagner fetched $464,876, which is less than some prior Apple-1 computers have sold for. A signed 128K Macintosh Motherboard sold for $132,049, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for $94,949.





A copy of Macworld #1 that was signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold for $201,021, and a leather bomber jacket that was worn by Jobs in the 1983 "middle finger to IBM" photo sold for $66,466.

Bungie revealed that Season of the Lost will start this Tuesday
 The name and art for Destiny 2’s 15th season leaked Thursday night, and Bungie officially confirmed it on Friday morning. Season of the Lost, starring Mara Sov, will start on Tuesday, Aug. 24, immediately following Bungie’s Destiny Showcase. The developer will reveal the new season and the upcoming The Witch Queen expansion during the livestream.
Normally, a simple season name and the reveal of its main characters only serve to hype players up. But Season of the Lost’s name and Mara’s involvement bring a certain weight: Both details appear in a major, months-old leak. With Bungie’s confirmation, one of the biggest rumors in the series’ history just got a lot more credible.

Several of the internal documents related to internal discussions around the possibility of sideloading iPhone apps outside of the ‌App Store‌. Some of these discussions may have gone further than expected, since in 2008, software chief Scott Forstall asked Steve Jobs what text should appear to iOS users when they want to open a sideloaded app. Jobs agreed to the following alert: "Are you sure you want to open the application 'Monkey Ball' from the developer 'Sega'?"

Tim Cook likes to begin his days early; he's at his desk by 4am. "I do that because I can control the morning better than the evening and through the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter says it is rolling out a number of changes to the way direct messages work, including the ability to send a direct message to several people in different conversations. 





Going forward, Twitter says users will be able to share the same tweet in up to 20 separate direct message conversations, which should ensure "no more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a tweet to multiple people."



Twitter says this change is rolling out on iOS and web over the next few weeks, with the changes coming "soon" on Android.



Twitter is also tweaking DM timestamps for iOS users in order to reduce "timestamp clutter." Rather than having each message within a DM conversation stamped with the date and time, Messages will be grouped by day. 



In addition, the Twitter iOS app is gaining a couple of user interface tweaks, including a long-press gesture to access the "add reaction" buttons (previously only accessible via a double tap, and a new down-arrow button to return to the most recent message in a DM conversation after scrolling through.



Earlier this month, Twitter added support for Sign in With Apple, allowing new users to create an account using their Apple ID while hiding their true email address from the social network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has delayed its plan to return employees back to the office until at least January, due to concerns over an increase in COVID-19 cases and the possible emergence of new variants, Bloomberg reports. 





Apple had previously planned to return to in-person work by early September, but the company delayed that timeline until October. Now, due to continued concerns, that timeframe has been further pushed back until at least January. 



In a memo sent to staff, obtained by Bloomberg, the company's human resource and retail chief, Deirdre O’Brien, said that Apple is not planning to close its offices or retail stores that are currently open, but is encouraging employees to get vaccinated. Unlike other companies, Apple has yet to enforce a requirement for employees to be vaccinat…]]></summary>

Nightborne and Lightforged Draenei get a treat
 When World of Warcraft: Shadowlands launched, there was with a buffet of character customization options for humans, night elves, orcs, and undead. However, a few of the races — especially the game’s Allied Races, which don’t have their own starting zone and can only be unlocked in the end game — fell a little short. Blizzard stated that they would not be revisiting the issue during Shadowlands, but it looks like that’s about to change. On Thursday, a community manager shared the following information on the official Blizzard forums.
Our characters in game are a virtual representation of who we are in Azeroth and having more character customization options to design our characters helps us feel closer to…]]></summary>

The anniversary edition arrives Nov. 11
 Bethesda announced a new edition of the fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim on Thursday, during QuakeCon at Home 2021. Skyrim is about to turn 10, which is a very momentous anniversary indeed, and the new Anniversary Edition will have some nice bonuses for players. 
Skyrim’s Anniversary Edition will be available for players on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The Anniversary Edition contains the full game, all enhancements from the Special Edition, and the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions.
The game comes with a free next-gen console upgrade, over 500 Creation Club elements like quests, dungeons, bosses, and weapons.  Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.
It’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands. The Elder Scrolls 6 remains elusive, but fans will be able to tuck into Skyrim once again and enjoy all of their old quests — as well as a new spin, thanks to fishing.]]></summary>

Foxconn has been pursuing electric vehicles since 2014 when there was an "A-Fu Initiative" to build an electric vehicle prototype. That project ultimately folded because of the complexity of creating a car, but Foxconn is once again building up a vehicle supply chain with plans to get into EV manufacturing.

Plus, you can date weapons
 The sincerity with which developer Kitfox Games enters into Boyfriend Dungeon is contagious. It’d otherwise be easy to write the game off as a joke, a concept that’s wacky just to be wacky. I mean, it’s a dating simulator in which you date people that can turn into weapons, which can then be used to fight through monstrous dungeons. But it’s a concept that’s executed in earnest, with thoughtfulness and care grounding the otherwise implausible world. It was easy to just go with it. So yeah, the game is about dating people that you’ll also use as weapons to fight your insecurities. What of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the New Yorker, the novelist Donald Antrim wrote about wanting to die by suicide and being saved by electroconvulsive therapy: Finding a Way Back from Suicide.
I had survived, or thought that I’d survived, my parents’ drinking and shouting, our constant moving, the losses of places and friends, annihilation after annihilation. I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother. None of this had stopped my dying. Writing had not stopped my dying. The Twelve Steps had not stopped my dying. Therapy hadn’t stopped it, and my old friends couldn’t stop it; nor could Regan. No one could.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has temporarily shut down its retail store located in Charleston, South Carolina after more than 20 staff members were exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, reports Bloomberg.





According to the website for the store, it will be shuttered until Monday, August 23. According to Bloomberg, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.



Apple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.



Continuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple's store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then reinstated mask mandates at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.



Apple had also planned to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since pushed back those plans because of the prevalence of the delta variant.

Black Panther absorbs attacks 
 Marvel’s Avengers’ version of Black Panther is impervious to most attacks, and it makes him as kinetic to play as his MCU counterpart is to watch.
The first expansion for Marvel’s Avengers, War for Wakanda, hit the game earlier this week and added Black Panther to the list of playable heroes. With the roster up to nine Avengers, making the heroes stand out is key to the games’ success. But Black Panther has some defensive abilities that make him a blast to play. 
There are three different varieties of enemy attacks in Marvel’s Avengers: light attacks, strong attacks, and unblockable attacks. For strong attacks, players either need to time a parry to avoid damage or dodge out of the way. And as you might expect, un…]]></summary>

Plus a new Quake expansion pack
 Three Quake games — Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena — are now available through Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft announced the additions on Thursday alongside the start of QuakeCon 2021, shortly after id Software revealed and released a remastered version of the original Quake.
Quake’s enhanced version is available on Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Xbox Game Pass, while Quake 2 and Quake 3: Arena can be played on Windows PC through the subscription service “in their original form.” In other words, Quake 2 and Quake 3 haven’t been remastered. Players looking to enjoy Quake 2 in prettier form should check out the free Quake 2 RTX release, pictured above.
Bethesda Software’s remastered Quake, a new version of the 25-year-old game, has 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames. It’s also available on its own on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (and PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility), and Windows PC.
The three Quake games join a lineup that includes more than 30 Bethesda Softworks-published titles, many of which were added to Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda.]]></summary>

The original Colors is from 2010, but this animation is all new
 Sonic Colors: Ultimate is an upcoming remaster of the original Wii platformer, and Sega has released a cartoon for players who need a refresher on the game’s lore. “Rise of the Wisps” is a two-part animation, and the first part was released on Thursday. Directed by Tyson Hesse, the artist behind Sonic Mania Adventures, Rise of the Wisps tells the story of Sonic, Tails, and one Jade Wisp, who needs help taking down Dr. Eggman.
The animations and cartoons surrounding Sonic releases are some of the best hedgehog-related content in years. Even if you’re not a fan of the games themselves, it’s nice to see that Tails, Sonic and company are still up to their old hijinks. While the upcoming Part 2 of Rise of the Wisps will probably have much more action, Part 1 helps set the scene, and it includes some fun exchanges between Tails, the Jade Wisp, and Sonic.
The next mainline game in the Sonic series is currently planned for 2022, and is a 3D game, although details are otherwise light. Sonic Colors: Ultimate is set to release on Sept. 7 on the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

id Software classic gets 4K/60 fps support and new expansion from MachineGames
 Bethesda Softworks released a remastered version of the original Quake, the landmark first-person shooter id Software published 25 years ago, on Thursday. The new version of Quake includes 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a brand-new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames.
The remastered Quake is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One, and is playable through backward compatibility on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. On PC, Steam and Bethesda Launcher users who already own Quake will automatically receive the new version with a free download. 
In terms of visuals, players can expect improved lighting and models, dynamic shadows, motion blur, and anti-aliasing. The game’s score, produced by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor, is also included. Expansion packs Scourge of Armagon, Dissolution of Eternity, and Dimension of the Past (the new, MachineGames-created add-on), are now included as part of the standard Quake package. More details are available at Bethesda’s announcement.
The original Quake, which launched in the summer of 1996, was id’s successor to the Doom series. Although it, too, launched as a single-player FPS with a campaign, it became much more popular as a multiplayer arena shooter. It was followed by four sequels between 1997 and 2007.
Bethesda acquired id Software and its franchises in 2009, but the only Quake title published since then is 2017’s Quake Champions on Windows PC, which is now a free-to-play game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a bit obsessed recently with urban architecture that incorporates nature & greenery into the mix, especially since seeing the technique employed so creatively in Singapore last year, so this new book called Evergreen Architecture is tickling that fancy right now.
As more of the earth’s surface is swallowed up by the built environment, architects are increasingly advised to integrate urban flora and fauna into their designs. Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.
Embracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?

But maybe a good game isn’t the point
 Fortnite’s new Impostors event is simple: Ten players enter a station, but two of them are impostors. The innocent crew members need to complete a series of tasks around the map without getting murdered — or at least while catching the murderer as quickly as possible. Yes, there’s no way around it: It’s Among Us. 
Among Us’ gameplay loop is simple and lean; Fortnite’s Imposters clutters it up. Impostors is visually busy and crowded, and it’s not just because everyone has their fancy 3D model with custom skins and emotes attached. It’s hard to see myself playing it with family members, much less politicians using it as a public outreach tool. 
It’s a worse game, but that’s not the point. Actually watching streams or playing t…]]></summary>

Health regen is back
 Call of Duty: Vanguard will bring the series back to World War II. But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.
During a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.
“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”
Call of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division; Captain Wade Jackson, from the U.S.’s Scouting Squadron Six; and Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs of Australia’s 20th Battalion. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s preview.
At the same time that Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

Vanguard Zombies will tie into Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies mode
 Treyarch’s Call of Duty Zombies modes are usually limited to the games the studio develops itself, but that’s not the case this time around. During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.
Treyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. 
Treyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map. It’s unclear if the Zombies mode in Vanguard will continue Treyarch’s Black Ops storyline or be something entirely separate. 
Call of Duty: Vanguard will be released on Nov. 5. Activision and Treyarch hasn’t announced if the Zombies mode will arrive when the game launches or sometime after. 
At the same time Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nanoleaf today announced the addition of Thread Border Router technology to the Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements Controllers, with the functionality available through a firmware update in the Nanoleaf app.





With the Nanoleaf Border Router, Nanoleaf Essentials devices will be able to connect to the Thread network automatically when the Shapes or Elements Controller is connected to WiFi.



Nanoleaf is also partnering with Eero for similar capabilities. The Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 will function as Border Routers with the Nanoleaf Essentials line. Eero will expand compatibility with other products in the future.



Nanoleaf is one of the first companies bringing Thread Border Routers to the HomeKit network, making Thread technology available to other Thread-based smart home devices.



Thread technology is designed to improve the smart home networking and usage experience. Thread is a networking protocol designed for smart home products, and it offers improved connectivity, reliability, and range compared to the single connection points of Bluetooth and WiFi. Border Router technology connects a Thread network to another network like WiFi and is essential for the Thread system.



With Thread Border Router functionality built into the Nanoleaf Shapes Controller, Elements Controller, and Eero routers, there is no need for an extra hub because these devices serve as a bridge to connect the WiFi network and the Thread network together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple TV+ today shared the official trailer for highly-anticipated sci-fi series "Foundation" ahead of its premiere on September 24.






Based on the best-selling novels by Isaac Asimov, Apple says "Foundation" is an epic saga chronicling a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.
When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari's claims, the ruling Cleons – a long line of emperor clones – fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they're forced to reckon with the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.
"Foundation" stars Emmy Award nominees Jared Harris and Lee Pace, alongside Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch.



The first episode of "Foundation" will be released on Apple TV+ on September 24, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday. Series writer and showrunner David Goyer hopes to tell the story over the course of 80 episodes.



Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a free seven-day trial available, or a longer trial available with the purchase of select new Apple products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today highlighted that the Apple Card and Goldman Sachs has been ranked top for customer satisfaction in the midsized issuer credit card segment, according to J.D. Power.





The J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study showed that the ‌Apple Card‌ ranked highest with a score of 864.1, across all of the surveyed categories including interaction, credit card terms, communication, benefits and services, rewards, and key moments. Apple's vice president of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, said:
It is exciting to be recognized with this first J.D. Power win, just two years after introducing Apple Card in 2019 and the first time being included in this study. We designed Apple Card to help our customers lead healthier financial lives, so it's incredibly meaningful to see that our customers are valuing this. Being recognized as the leader in this category this year is an honor, and we look forward to continuing to deliver this product, service, and support with our award-winning issuer as Apple Card expands to more and more customers across the U.S.




The ‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a no-fee credit card designed for the iPhone and supported by Goldman Sachs, featuring Apple Wallet integration and Daily Cash rewards with up to three percent cashback. The card is only available in the United States.

        <updated>2021-08-19T12:28:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of an aluminum cutout allegedly based on the upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini have surfaced online. The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.





The images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn't very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.



One interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It's also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. 



Reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the back-to-school season kicks in, Apple plans to update its baseline iPad this fall with a new ninth-generation model tailored towards students, sporting a thinner design and an improved processor, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.





In September of last year, Apple updated the baseline iPad with the faster and more powerful A12 Bionic chip starting at $329, or $299 for education customers. The baseline update sits at the lower end of the ‌iPad‌ lineup and is tailored for customers needing an affordable ‌iPad‌ for day-to-day use.



For the 9th generation model, Apple is likely to continue with the current design featuring Touch ID and a Home Button. The updated model will feature a faster processor with improved performance and graphics and a thinner form factor.



The updated ‌iPad‌ joins a busy fall season for Apple, as the company is also expected to be preparing a more significant update to the iPad mini. The new iPad mini is rumored to feature a larger display with smaller bezels, improved performance, and an updated overall design. Apple is also preparing new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros for launch in the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this evening began offering refurbished versions of the 24-inch M1 iMac in its U.S. online store, one day after starting to sell refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs in the UK.





Apple has over a dozen ‌M1‌ iMacs available at the current time, and this is the first time the ‌M1‌ iMacs have been available through the refurbished store in the U.S. since the machines launched in April.



The entry-level model with 8-core GPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD is available for $1,099, which is a $200 discount from the regular price of $1,299.



Apple also has higher-end refurbished models available for purchase, up to an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU option with a 1TB SSD and 16GB RAM, which is available for $1,779. At full price, the machine would cost $2,099.



There are multiple color options and configurations available at the current time, though stock will fluctuate going forward based on the machines that people are sending Apple for repairs and returns.



Apple's refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌iMac‌, plus they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

Apple in iOS 15 beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari

Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled
on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and
the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control
panel that does away with trying to merge all page management
options into a single address bar view.
I was a little worried when beta 5 shipped last week and Safari’s interface was unchanged, but beta 6’s changes are very good.
The initial iOS Safari 15 design failed in two big ways. First and foremost, Apple tried to squeeze two horizontal bars’ worth of cont…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Americans are collectively almost $15 trillion in debt, most of it related to housing (i.e. mortgage debt). For the New Yorker, Margaret Talbot shares some images from Brittany Powell’s The Debt Project, a series of 99 portraits of Americans in debt.
Powell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan “We are the ninety-nine per cent”) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”


The Debt Project is also available in book form.

Netflix is rolling out support for Spatial Audio on the iPhone and
the iPad, based on reports shared by MacRumors readers
and on Reddit. A Netflix spokesperson also confirmed to
MacRumors that the rollout is underway.
When you’re watching a movie on an iPhone or iPad, spatial audio is a  game changer for degree of immersiveness. Henceforth when preloading a movie or two for a plane trip, I’ll favor titles with spatial audio support. It really helps make up for the small screen by having big immersive sound.
Not surprised that Netflix is adding support sooner rather than later — one thing Netflix gets right is they want viewers to be happy. Spatial audio makes me happy.

The robots sure are getting good at moving around — running, jumping, doing flips, casually vaulting over railings like an eighth grader trying to impress friends. It is eerie and weird and uncanny and all other such adjectives watching these machines smoothly caper around like humans. Even in the blooper reel they seem really toddler-esque.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jumbo the Elephant was one of the most famous animals in the world. Bought as a calf in Sudan by a European animal dealer in 1860, Jumbo found fame first at the London Zoo and later as the centerpiece of the Barnum & Bailey Circus in the US. Jumbo was so beloved in London that news of his sale to P.T. Barnum prompted 100,000 children to write to Queen Victoria, urging her to nix the deal. In the video above, Andrew McClellan recounts Jumbo’s too-short (and probably unhappy) life and the impact he had on society.
The word “jumbo” hadn’t been known or used in the English language before he came along and has since become the byword for anything humongous or supersized. So every time we use the word “jumbo jet” or “jumbotron”, we’re actually referring back to Jumbo the elephant.

Safari Redesign


Apple in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes introduced in earlier betas.





Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control panel that does away with trying to merge all page management options into a single address bar view.

The Imperium still stands, and man are they pissed
 Eve Online’s latest player-led war has come to an end, not with a bang but with a cavernous whimper. Those on the offense have turned tail, and the defenders are putting everything they have into running them down.
The massive coalition known as PAPI campaigned for 55 weeks in a quest to destroy The Imperium, led by Alex “The Mittani” Gianturco, before losing the will to fight. Along the way, Eve Online developer CCP Games told Polygon, combatants destroyed more than $3 million worth of in-game ships and virtual infrastructure in the conflict dubbed World War Bee 2.

I decided early-on that if I was going to shoot candids of New Yorkers, I didn’t want it to be with a wide lens, up-close in their faces. I started using a 200mm lens so that I could be half a city block away from the subject. It’s similar to the way paparazzi shoot, and all my subjects are celebrities to me, so it’s fitting in that respect.

        <updated>2021-08-17T20:10:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple's $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.





Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple's cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.



In addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple's upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that's "roughly the same" as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.



Other Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.



Apple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.

The jersey ads are coming; whose money will the Flyers end up taking? 
 It leaked earlier today that, despite Gary Bettman’s assurances to the contrary last year, the NHL will finally give in to the corporate gods whose money and influence rules us all and sell advertising space on NHL jerseys for the upcoming season. 
From ESPN’s report on the story: 
The league’s board of governors formally voted this month to approve jersey advertisements. The NHL had surveyed its teams and found the majority of them in favor of jersey ads. The ads will be featured in a 3-inch-by-3.5-inch rectangle, which is larger than the NBA’s 2.5-by-2.5-inch space for uniform ads.

This is, of course, the second foray into selling advertising space on the players’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update for the Siri Remote designed for the new Apple TV 4K and ‌Apple TV‌ HD models. The new firmware has an internal version number of 9M6772, while the prior firmware version was 9M6336. Note that this is not the firmware version that you see in the ‌Apple TV‌ Remote settings. 





There's no word on what's new with the ‌Apple TV‌ remote update, but it likely addresses minor bugs and performance issues. 



Apple has not detailed how to install a firmware update for the ‌Siri‌ Remote, but it's likely similar to AirPods, delivered silently and over the air while the ‌Apple TV‌ is asleep. Firmware updates are installed in the background and it may take some time for the ‌Siri‌ Remote update to be downloaded and installed.

A bug that caused a bug
 “Hey, you’re finally awake ...” and now being catapulted to the moon thanks to a very strong bee.
Former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday describing a notorious bug — an actual bug, at least in-game — that caused major problems during The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim’s development. Purkeypile described the introductory scene in Skyrim where the player wakes up in the back of a cart with other prisoners. It’s where the famous “You’re finally wake” meme originated — but it’s also remembered by the developer for a catastrophic collision. 
So, I have a story about the Skyrim Intro and how hard game development is.
That intro is famous now, but back then, it was just that one thing …]]></summary>

There's now a Tweetbot 6 widget that can be added to the Today View or the Home Screen, and it shows the Twitter timeline. A single tweet can be shown in the smallest widget view, but there are also larger options that show more tweets at a glance.



When using the Tweetbot 6 update on iOS devices, there's now support for Handoff, so you can resume what you were doing on one device on another device using the built-in Handoff feature. Handoff does not yet work on the Mac, but support will be added later.



Tweetbot 6 now supports Shortcuts so Tweetbot actions can be used in the shortcuts created on iOS devices, plus on the ‌iPad‌, multiple Tweetbot windows are now supported for multitasking purposes. There are also additional app icons to choose from.



Tweetbot 6 can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but a subscription costs $5.99 per year or $0.99 per month. [Direct Link]

"Carpool Karaoke" could be watched through the ‌Apple Music‌ app or the Apple TV app, but it has not previously been a part of ‌Apple TV+‌ and limited to ‌Apple TV+‌ subscribers.





Based on the "Carpool Karaoke" segment of the "The Late Late Show With James Corden," Apple's version of "Carpool Karaoke" has been available since 2017.



Filming on "Carpool Karaoke" has been on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic, according to Deadline, but efforts are underway to begin production once again.



"Carpool Karaoke: The Series" brings various actors, athletes, and musicians together to chat and sing popular songs with one another. The fourth season of the show featured pairings like Maya Rudolph and Haim, Keegan-Michael Key and Rob Gronkowski, and the "Shark Tank" sharks.



There's no word yet on which celebrities will be featured in the fifth season of the show.

 Axiom Verge 2 is a Metroidvania game for people who hate the term “Metroidvania.” Thomas Happ Games’ second outing has a purist’s view of the genre built by Metroid that feels like a refreshing change of pace in a sea of imitators. More importantly, while its meticulously paced exploration and upgrade loops are a little too close to its inspiration at times, it’s the way Axiom Verge 2 digs into the isolation at the heart of the Metroid series that makes it stand out.
Axiom Verge 2 strands you on the cold, mysterious world of Kiengir and cuts right to the chase. You don’t know what’s going on or what anyone else is doing here, but you’re bent on going back to Earth. So you …]]></summary>

No release date was given, but it is expected to arrive soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is on the way. On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.
In addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.
Senior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”


Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year. It has yet to release for current generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, where it is only playable in compatibility mode.


Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June. You can read the full 1.3 patch notes at the game’s official website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 15 introduced a new Safari experience that moves the URL bar and tab interface to the bottom of the iPhone, a decision that has been controversial with ‌iPhone‌ users.




Safari options in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6


Throughout the beta testing period, Apple has been tweaking the design of the Safari browser on the ‌iPhone‌ and in beta 6, there are further refinements. The bottom tab bar has been redesigned to appear below page content, and Apple has also added a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom.




The original design in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5


The addition of a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the Safari interface returns Safari to a more iOS 14-like experience, walking back many of the ‌iOS 15‌ changes.





With the bottom view option toggled on, Safari offers a dedicated toolbar with buttons at the bottom of the interface, which is also an improvement over the prior floating design.



Apple has also introduced new setting options to remove the website tinting and to enable a Tab Bar while in landscape mode. There was previously a "Show Color in Tab Bar" accessibility setting, which appears to be the same as the new "Allow Website Tinting" toggle.  



Apple previously added similar toggles in iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey to offer either a separate tab bar (which was the original default when the betas launched) or a merged tab bar, which is more similar to the previous design.

Apple will instead make SharePlay available in an update to ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey that's coming later this year. 



With SharePlay being removed temporarily, Apple is offering an alternative tool for developers to test SharePlay development features, and a SharePlay profile is available for developers to download. 
SharePlay has been disabled for use in iOS and iPadOS 15 developer beta 6 and will be disabled for use in its initial release this fall. SharePlay will be enabled for use again in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall. To continue your development, we have provided a SharePlay Development Profile which will enable successful creation and reception of GroupSessions via the Group Activities API.
With SharePlay, ‌FaceTime‌ users can share their screens with one another, watch movies and TV shows in sync together, listen to music and contribute to a group playlist, and more.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system.

A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

Right now, Apple has one 24-inch iMac available in a pink color, which was first spotted by 9to5Mac. The machine features an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD and it is priced at £1,059, a £190.00 savings over the standard £1,249 price.



Refurbished stock varies based on what people have sent in for repair and replacement, and additional ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ models will be available in the future. Those looking for a specific build or a specific color will need to keep an eye on the store to wait for their preferred version to pop up.



All of Apple's refurbished Macs are sold with the same one-year warranty that's offered with a new Mac, plus they come with all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C power adapter and cable. Apple's refurbished devices are subjected to a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging and cleaning process to make them identical to new devices.



Categories for refurbished 24-inch iMacs have also shown up in the United States, so we can expect to see the refurbished ‌iMac‌ models available in other countries in the near future.

So long, farewell, etc, etc. 
 The time has come, folks. Lengthy, tumultuous, and often divisive, the Robert Hagg saga has come to an end in Philadelphia. As part of the return for Buffalo in the trade that brought Rasmus Ristolainen to the Flyers, this awful and messy 2020-21 season was Hagg’s last with them, and in a lot of ways it was a solid individual final showing, and serves as a positive endnote and send-off.

The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled "Hydration measurement with a watch" and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



"Traditional techniques for tracking hydration are generally invasive, expensive, or unreliable," according to Apple. This refers to existing ways of determining hydration such as single-use tests of fluid samples.



Apple's hydration sensor takes the form of non-invasive electrodes that are placed against the skin, which it describes as a "reliable and elegant" solution. The sensor works by measuring the electrical properties of the Apple Watch wearer's sweat. The patent explains:

Eat your heart out, Garo Yepremian
 Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, Rick Felice’s empty-the-garage mashup of sporting goods and athletes, at last launches on Xbox One on Aug. 27. This version, teased as far back as GDC 2017, brings along a new Season Mode that supports local cooperative play with up to three players.
“Now you and your friends can create a team, build a fan base, win trophies, and discover secrets, multiple endings, and 100 achievements along the way,” Felice said. An update for the Windows PC version is coming soon; it will support cloud saves, remote play, and the 100 new achievements, too.

This is Epic Games’ second crack at a hidden role mode
 Fortnite has another new Among Us-style mode and this time its a lot closer to its inspiration. Epic revealed the new mode on Tuesday, as part of Fortnite’s latest patch.
The new limited time mode is called Impostors, and it features 10 players — eight Agents and two Impostors — in each match. All 10 players are aboard The Bridge on the island (also like Among Us). The Agents are trying to complete tasks that will help them arrive at their destination safely; Impostors try to eliminate the Agents without having their identity discovered. Whenever things seem a little too suspicious, or when player’s body is found, all the remaining players convene to discuss who the Impostor might be.

Now, Mastercard is set to be the first payments network to phase out the magnetic stripe.



Starting in 2024, Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to feature a magnetic stripe in most markets, including Europe.

On August 1, select models of the Series 6 Edition with titanium were unavailable for delivery and/or pick-up. Now, all titanium models are unavailable for delivery or pick-up and can't even be added to Apple's online store bag.



The unavailability comes just weeks ahead of when we expect Apple to announce the Apple Watch Series 7 with a new design. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has speculated that the spotty lack of availability for the Apple Watch Edition earlier this month could entail Apple deciding to discontinue the higher-end lineup with the Series 7.



We've contacted Apple for comment and will let MacRumors' readers know if we hear back.

The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which also filed suit against Activision Blizzard in July, released a statement Monday (PDF) that said Riot has delayed informing its employees of their rights for two months.
Riot was ordered to send a notice to its employees on June 4 — to issue a memo that “advise[d] workers of their right to speak freely with the government about unlawful workplace practices” without fear of retaliation, regardless o…]]></summary>

Horror game’s next chapter may summon Pinhead
 Horror game Dead by Daylight’s next chapter will apparently bring the Hellraiser film franchise into the fold, based on a series of teases from developer Behaviour Interactive. That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.
Behaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.
That’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.
Behaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.
Dead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at In Focus, Alan Taylor is highlighting the work of Bob Wick, a photographer for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management who recently retired after 33 years of service.
In a recent interview, Bob reflected on his career. “It has been extremely fulfilling to see my photos used in BLM, across the Department, and non-profits and getting to showcase the beauty of public lands and the resources we see,” he said. “When you see things on paper in words, it’s one thing, but when you see the image of the lands that you’re affecting with that resource decision, it’s a more powerful way to communicate the message.” 
Bob added, “I like bringing joy to people with photos. A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today told retail staff in the United States and Europe that it is planning to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes starting on August 30, reports Bloomberg.





Classes are set to resume at most U.S. locations, but Apple's plan to roll out in-person classes could be delayed at some Apple Store locations in areas where there is a surge in COVID-19 cases. 



With Today at Apple sessions slated to return, Apple today began accepting signups for in-store sessions on its website. Apple has not held in-person classes at its retail stores since March 2020, but the company has been offering virtual classes and the occasional outdoor class.





Apple retail stores have been reopened since earlier this year, but Apple recently reinstated a mask mandate that requires customers visiting most retail stores in the United States to wear a mask. Apple had dropped mask mandates for vaccinated customers in June, but brought them back in areas heavily impacted by the Delta variant of COVID-19.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new version of its iCloud for Windows app, with the 12.5 update adding a new ‌iCloud‌ Keychain password manager app for Windows users.





With the new password management option, those who are running Windows can access their ‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords and can add, edit, copy and paste, delete, and look up usernames or passwords. Apple in January released an updated version of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows that hinted at the new password app, but Apple did not implement it until now.



New ‌iCloud‌ password extensions for Microsoft Edge and Windows Chrome work in tandem with the password feature, letting ‌iCloud‌ passwords be autofilled on a Windows machine just like in Safari. Usernames and passwords created for websites are automatically added to the Passwords app.





‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords on Windows are stored in an encrypted database and are transferred to the browser extension using an encrypted channel, with passwords not stored in clear text.



‌iCloud‌ for Windows Passwords is part of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows 12.5, and Windows users can download it from the Microsoft Store. The ‌iCloud‌ for Windows app is designed to let Windows users access their ‌iCloud‌ files, photos, emails, and more from Windows devices.

In the video above from 2019, Benedict Cumberbatch reads Vonnegut’s prescient letter. His main message is an environmental one: that if we don’t get our shit together, Nature will have its way with us.
The sort of leaders we need now are not those who promise ultimate victory over Nature through perseverance in living as we do right now, but those with the courage and intelligence to present to the world what appears to be Nature’s stern but reasonable surrender terms:
1. Reduce and stabilize your population.

 Activision released a new teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard, officially announcing the next game in the series after a series of leaks. Players will get a first look at this year’s Call of Duty game on Aug. 19, during a special event inside Call of Duty: Warzone called the Battle of Verdansk.
The first trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard opens with a montage of battlefields that centers on World War II. There’s a sniper’s nest that appears to be in or near Russia, a desert battlefield, a German forest, and a beach littered with destroyed aircraft.

Patch 1.3 is expected soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is expected to launch soon. On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.
First, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. 


Second, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.


Finally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.
“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”
Monday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way. CD Projekt promises more details on Aug. 17 during a live Twitch stream.
Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.]]></summary>

Diana Prince will join Batman and Superman in the battle royale 
 Fortnite is getting a little more heroic with the addition of a Wonder Woman outfit in an upcoming update. 
Diana Prince’s outfit will come with a battle armor variant as well as her iconic regular costume. Of course, the outfit won’t be the only cosmetic for the Amazonian hero. She’ll also be released alongside the Athena’s Battleaxe gathering tool, the DC Trinity loading screen, where she poses with Batman and Superman, the Golden Eagle Wings glider, and the Diana’s Mantle back bling. 
The new skin will make Diana Prince the latest member of the Justice League to join Fortnite. Many other heroes have found a place on the Fortnite island in the last several years, including several others from DC, like Beast Boy and Raven, as well as Marvel heroes like Black Widow, and the rest of the Avengers. 
Fortnite’s Wonder Woman skin will be released on Aug. 19. To celebrate the release of the new outfit, Epic will also host the Wonder Woman Cup tournament and give players a few challenges to complete, all related to the Amazonian warrior.]]></summary>

It’s impossible not to like our new #89.
 The summer of 2021, across nearly all sports worldwide, has brought about massive amounts of change for both athletes and teams. Some clubs have come back with completely different rosters, while others (such as Cleveland’s baseball team) with an entirely different name. This theme of change was really cemented when arguably the most popular athlete in the world, Lionel Messi, swapped Barcelona, a city he’s called home for over twenty years, for Paris in a move that shocked most of the world. 
But that’s enough about other sports, this is a hockey blog!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In The Hidden Melodies of Subways Around the World, the NY Times takes a look at an often overlooked aspect of transit design: the door closing sounds on the subway. My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: 
In Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”
In Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)


You can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The popular VPN service NordVPN has rolled out an update to add native support for Apple silicon Macs.





As of version 6.6.1, NordVPN natively supports Apple silicon Macs, such as the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and 24-inch iMac, which each sport the M1 chip.



Although the update started to roll out on August 3, a blog post by Nord has today announced that the 6.6.1 update is now fully available via the App Store and the NordVPN website, where the app is available for download.



While the VPN app previously ran on Apple silicon Macs via Rosetta 2, which translates apps made for Intel Macs so that they work on Macs with the ‌M1‌ chip, the new native version of the app is able to run more efficiently without the need for Rosetta 2. The new version of the app is universal, meaning that it can run on both Intel and Apple silicon architectures.



The update comes ahead of the widely-anticipated launch of new Apple silicon Macs, such as 14 and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pro models. NordVPN version 6.6.1 is now available via the ‌App Store‌ and the NordVPN website.

Arc System Works’ second DLC fighter is almost here
 Jack-O’ Valentine is coming to Guilty Gear Strive at the end of August, developer Arc System Works announced Sunday. Jack-O’ will be the second playable fighter included as part of the fighting game’s first season pass, following alien-coffin-wielding military man Goldlewis Dickinson’s release in July.
Guilty Gear fans are already quite familiar with Jack-O’. She was added as a playable character in 2016’s Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator, and in Strive, she’ll fight using her jack-o’-lantern-themed ball and chain, and a trio of summonable minions. You can see her in action in the trailer above.


Jack-O’ is coming to Guilty Gear Strive on Aug. 27 for players who own the game’s $29.99 season pass. Everyone else can download her starting Aug. 30, for $6.99. She’s one of five characters planned for Guilty Gear Strive’s first season pass. One more DLC fighter is planned for release in 2021, with two more coming in 2022.
Guilty Gear fans can also look forward to Baiken from Arc System Works’ fighting game series coming to SNK’s Samurai Shodown as part of season pass 3.


Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.]]></summary>

The veteran goalie was, again, pressed into more action than him or the Flyers would have liked — and the results backed it up.
 Just about nothing went right for the Flyers in terms of goaltending in 2020-21, but Brian Elliott provided dependable veteran presence despite albeit less-than-stellar results. 
And in a massive — and unexpected — surprise, Elliott ended up logging the most games and starts of any Flyers goalie last season. The 36-year-old was pressed into more duty than expected as Carter Hart struggled mightily in his third season of NHL action. 
Hart’s numbers weren’t pretty, and playing behind a Flyers defense that couldn’t keep it together for large stretches of the season didn’t help either. Those results took a toll on …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple must pay $300 million in damages to Optis Wireless Technology for infringing a handful of patents related to 4G LTE technology, a Texas jury has ruled (via Reuters).





In August 2020, a jury found that Apple had infringed five Optis wireless patents and awarded $506 million in damages, but a Texas judge vacated that award in April and ordered a new trial to focus on damages only.



US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury was unable to determine if the amount was awarded on the FRAND terms (a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis) usually required in standard essential patent cases.



PanOptis and its sister companies, Optis Wireless Technology, Optis Cellular Technology, Unwired Planet, and Unwired Planet International, are non-practicing entities that hold patents and generate revenue through patent litigation, otherwise known as patent trolls.



In a statement, Apple said: "Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate. We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire."

Like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple's upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are expected to feature mini-LED displays. In his latest investor note, seen by MacRumors, Kuo says this will stoke strategic supplier investment in the technology, which will allow Apple to diversify supply risk and bring down production costs.

We believe that MacBooks, not iPads, mainly drive Mini LED panel shipments. MacBook shipments have not grown much in the past few years. However, we expect MacBook shipments to grow significantly by 20% YoY, or more in 2021 and 2022, due to th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is planning to hold multiple events this fall, which will collectively include the launch of new iPhones, Apple Watches, updated AirPods, revamped iPad mini, and the redesigned MacBook Pros, according to respected Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman. 





In his latest weekly Power On newsletter, Gurman says that much like last year, Apple will hold multiple events this coming fall, with the first likely being in September for the iPhone 13. Last year, due to the global health crisis and production constraints, the iPhone 12 lineup was not announced until October. The 2020 September event, rather than focusing on new iPhones, showcased new Apple Watches, iPads, and services.

Shortly after Warnermedia removed its HBO Max offering from ‌Apple TV‌ Channels in May, an update to its subsequently released tvOS app essentially broke several features of the service.



In June, HBO Max dropped the native tvOS video player in favor of a custom video player, which introduced issues with fast-forwarding and rewinding video in the app.



Recognizing its mistake, HBO quickly reinstated the native tvOS video player UI. However, problems with playback control remained, while users have continued to report other issues to do with subtitles and audio description.

A bit of housekeeping is complete. 
 We’re deep into August and things are pretty quiet on the hockey news front, at least for the Flyers, but they still have a few loose ends that needed (or might need) tying up, and they knocked out one of those today. 
The Flyers announced this afternoon that they’ve signed their 2021 second round pick Samu Tuomaala to a three-year entry level contract. Tuomaala spent the 2020-21 season with Kärpät’s U20 team, where he put up 31 points (15 goals and 16 assists) in 30 regular season games, and four points (1G, 4A) in five playoff games. He also represented Finland in the U18 World Championship, and he recorded 11 points (5G, 6A) in seven games, leading his team in scoring. 
In short: he’s good, gang! Here’s what Flyers’ AGM Brent Flahr and Director of European Scouting Joakim Grundberg had to say about him. 
“He’s a guy we targeted. We kind of thought he would probably go at the end of the first or somewhere in the 20s and he fell. A real talented winger. Great skater. Real dynamic speed. Loves to shoot the puck. Talented kid. He’s going to take a little time to get stronger and put on a little weight. A talented kid that has real good offensive upside.” - Flahr
“Obviously very excited getting him. He was rated as a first round talent. We were able to get him in the middle of the second round, so we’re really excited about that. To us, he has elite speed and high skill. Very good shot. High-offensive upside. There’s things he’s got to work on like his overall game and obviously getting stronger. We’re really excited. We see a lot of upside there.” - Grundberg
Now, it may still be a little while before we see Tuomaala make the jump over to North America. He’s slated to join Kärpät (Liiga) next season, and this ELC can slide to allow that to happen. But he’s locked in with the Flyers all the same, and it’s a bit of housekeeping taken care of.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maia Spoto, Chalkbeat Chicago:
School-based teachers and staff, central office, regular vendors and network employees who aren’t fully vaccinated or can’t provide documentation of an exemption by the deadline will be ineligible to work for the district until they submit proof of inoculation or exemption.
Until the Oct. 15 cutoff, staff who aren’t vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test at least once a week, the district said. As of August, 68 percent of district employees have been fully vaccinated, according to self-reported district data. Among teachers, that rate is higher, with 82 percent reporting that they are fully vaccinated.
More like this, please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More on the thinking behind Glass:
Om: Tom, tell us a bit about yourself and what prompted you to
start Glass.
Tom Watson: I’ve been designing digital products for over 20
years now. I was an early Product Designer at Facebook (2009-2013)
and Pinterest (2013-2018). I saw the tradeoffs firsthand around
having to design for engagement versus people using the product.
That experience made me want to build something different. […]
We intentionally didn’t raise venture capital. We didn’t want to
make the compromises that I saw earlier in my career. With no
outside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo
advertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several
other things we feel would compromise the product and community
we’re trying to build.
Om: Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional
photographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?
TW: It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be
anything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone
with tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe
great photography can come from anywhere and anyone. We hope to
build a community for all levels of photographers to learn, grow,
and generally nerd out about photography.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glass is a new photo sharing app/community:
We want you to adore Glass, not become addicted to it. We’ve
created a distraction-free app focused on one thing — your
photos. […] All the social network features you’d expect with
none of the dark patterns driving engagement. Build relationships
with and learn from other photographers while enjoying a
chronological feed and no public counts. […]
Glass is subscription-based, which means we won’t sell your data
or pollute your feed with ads. We don’t answer to outside
investors or advertisers, just members of our community.
$4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly $29.99 yearly (at launch)
keeps Glass rolling.
Is it just like OG Instagram? No. Glass is doing its own thing in a bunch of subtle ways. But it’s certainly a lot more like Instagram circa 2010 than Instagram is today. In spirit, it feels a lot like the early days of Flickr. I’ve been beta testing Glass for a few months and it’s an absolutely lovely, exquisitely-designed app. It’s downright serene scrolling through my Glass timeline, something that I haven’t been able to say about Instagram in many years.
Currently iOS only — in fact, I believe the only way to sign in is through Sign In With Apple. There’s a wait list to get in now that they’re out of beta; if Glass intrigues you, I encourage you to sign up now.

The developers sneaked in a reference to the game 
 A new victory scene from Call of Duty: Warzone’s recently launched season hints at 2021’s Call of Duty game, according to footage posted online on Friday. This year’s entry in the franchise, which is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games, will be called Call of Duty: Vanguard and send players back to World War II, according to images of the game that leaked earlier this week.
The victory scene is new for season 5 of Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which went live on Friday. The cutscene shows the winning team being extracted from the battlefield — that is until, a red-haired woman in a Soviet World War II uniform shoots the last player with an old-school wooden sniper rifle. The soldier’s attire and weapon seem to support the aforementioned leaks, which suggested that 2021’s Call of Duty game will take place in WWII. 
What’s more is that the character herself resembles a person depicted in leaked images of Vanguard — further seeming to confirm prior information, and that the victory scene is a reference to the upcoming game. 
The leaks also contained details on Vanguard’s Ultimate Edition and information about three bundles for the game. However, they didn’t mention a release date for Vanguard. 
Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer.]]></summary>

Unfortunately, communal benefit is harder to define, harder to quantify, and harder to describe than individual protection, because “it’s not the way Americans are used to thinking about things,” Neil Lewis, a behavioral scientist and communications expert at Cornell, told me. That’s in part because communal risk isn’t characteristic of the health perils people in wealthy countries are accustomed to facing: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer. Maybe that’s part of why we gravitate toward individual-focused comparisons. Slipping into a pandemic-compatible, population-based frame of mind is a big shift. In the age of COVID-19, “there’s been a lot of focus on the individual,” Lewis told me. That’s pretty at odds “with how infection works.”


As someone who has struggled with analogizing the virus & vaccines, I was nodding my head a lot while reading this. Something I’ve noticed in recent years that Wu didn’t get into is that readers desire precision in metaphors and analogies, even though metaphor is — by definition! — not supposed to be taken literally. People seem much more interested in taking analogies apart, identifying what doesn’t work, and discarding them rather than — more generously and constructively IMO — using them as the author intended to better understand the subject matter. The perfect metaphor doesn’t exist because then it wouldn’t be a metaphor.

The young prospect that made a huge impact last season is staying off the ice for a while.
 This is going to be a significant year for Philadelphia Flyers prospects, but one of them is going to be sitting on the sidelines for potentially quite a while.
Announced by the team on Friday, 2020 fourth-round pick Zayde Wisdom has undergone successful shoulder surgery this summer and is out indefinitely.
Injury update: 2020 NHL Draft pick (4th round, 94th overall) Zayde Wisdom had successful shoulder surgery today in Philadelphia. Wisdom appeared in 28 games last season with the @LVPhantoms (AHL), recording 18 points (7g-11a). He is out indefinitely. pic.twitter.com/rkXfsnxCv1

Get four weapons in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Endless Vale
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — Igneous Hammer, Solar hand cannon
7 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
Flawless — Shayura’s Wrath (Adept), Void submachine gun
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQUO1DSwYN0"/>
        <updated>2021-08-13T17:41:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clarifying interview, with at least one bit of news: Federighi says the heretofore unspecified “threshold” for CSAM fingerprint matches that must be reached before an iCloud account is flagged (or even can be flagged, thanks to how the shared-key cryptography is implemented) is “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images”. Right around the 3:00 mark:
“And if, and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order
of 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does
Apple know anything about your account and know anything about
those images.”
There’s also a WSJ news story (News+ link), co-bylined by Stern and Tim Higgins, in which Federighi emphasizes that the database of CSAM fingerprints is auditable:
Beyond creating a system that isn’t scanning through all of a
user’s photos in the cloud, Mr. Federighi pointed to another
benefit of placing the matching process on the phone directly.
“Because it’s on the [phone], security researchers are constantly
able to introspect what’s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,”
he said. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the
scope of this in some way — in a way that we had committed to not
doing — there’s verifiability, they can spot that that’s
happening.”
Critics have said the database of images could be corrupted, such
as political material being inserted. Apple has pushed back
against that idea. During the interview, Mr. Federighi said the
database of images is constructed through the intersection of
images from multiple child-safety organizations — not just the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He added that
at least two “are in distinct jurisdictions.” Such groups and an
independent auditor will be able to verify that the database
consists only of images provided by those entities, he said.

Another game can be added to the list, as Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls from well-known Japanese company Konami is set to launch exclusively on Apple Arcade, across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Mobile gaming enthusiasts may remember that the game had soft launched on the App Store in Canada back in 2019, but it was removed less than a year later. No specific release date has been announced for its Apple Arcade return.



The side-scrolling action game will feature a lineup of iconic characters from the popular gothic video game series, including Alucard, Simon Belmont, Charlotte, Shanoa, Maria, and more to come. Players will be tasked with blasting their way through Dracula's army using a variety of attacks, weapons, and unique character moves.



The original trailer for the game from 2019 can be watched below.






In addition, a trio of Apple Arcade games have recently been updated, with a new mini-game and new quests added to The Oregon Trail, five new songs added to Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat, and 200 new levels added in Simon's Cat - Story Time.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically. A free one-month trial is available for first-time subscribers.

"Matter," announced last year and formerly known as "Project CHIP," is a unified IP-based connectivity that aims to make a standard universal protocol for developers to build Internet of Things devices. The Alliance had previously sought to roll out the standard in the latter portion of this year, but it's now been delayed until 2022. 



The group says that "Matter" is complete in regards to its feature set. However, according to the blog post, it still needs to continue working on the program in which developers can apply for certification and finish the SDK for developers to use.



Several smart home accessory makers have signed onto using Matter as a standard protocol, including Amazon, ASSA ABLOY, Comcast, Espressif Systems, Eve Systems, Google, Grundfos Holding A/S, Huawei, Infineon Technologies, LEEDARSON, Legrand, Nanoleaf, and others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an issue of his newsletter, The Convivial Society, L.M. Sacasas posed 41 questions that we should ask ourselves about technologies to help us “draw out the moral or ethical implications of our tools”. Here are a few of the questions:
3. How will the use of this technology affect my experience of time?


Sacasas recently joined Ezra Klein on his podcast to talk through some of the answers to these questions for certain technologies.
EZRA KLEIN: I’m gonna group the next set together. So what was required of other human beings, of other creatures, of the earth, so that I might be able to use this technology? When you ask that, when you think of that, what comes to mind?
MICHAEL SACASAS: So I recently wrote a piece, and its premise was that sometimes we think of the internet, of digital life, as being immaterial, existing somewhere out in the ether, in the cloud, with these metaphors that kind of suggest that it doesn’t really have a material footprint. But the reality of course — I think as most of us are becoming very aware — is that it very much has a material reality that may begin in a mine where rare earth metals are being extracted in inhumane working conditions at great cost to the local environment.
But that’s very far removed from my comfortable experience of the tablet on my couch in the living room. And so with regards to the earth, the digital realm depends upon material resources that need to be collected. It depends on the energy grid. It leaves a footprint on the environment.
And so we tend not to think about that by the time that it gets to us and looks so shiny and clean and new, and connects us to this world that isn’t physically necessarily located anywhere in our experience. And so I think it is important for us to think about the labor, the extraction cost on the environment, that go into providing us with the kind of world that we find so amusing and interesting and comfortable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LG's first-ever OLED monitor has officially come to market, with the company's new 32-inch UltraFine Display OLED Pro Monitor now available to order through B&H Photo Video. Pricing is set at $3,999 in the United States.





Designed for creative professionals, LG says the monitor's 4K OLED panel provides exceptional color accuracy. However, the technology comes at a steep price compared to LG's standard UltraFine 4K monitor with LCD technology, which is available for $699.95 through Apple's online store in the United States.



Key tech specs of the monitor include HDR10, 99% coverage of the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a 60Hz refresh rate, 250 nits peak brightness, pixel dimming technology, a 1ms response time, and a 178º viewing angle. The monitor can be connected to a compatible Mac with a single USB-C cable, with 90W pass-through charging for any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.






Other connectivity on the rear of the monitor includes one HDMI port, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, three USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.



The monitor is currently out of stock on LG's website, but can be ordered from B&H Photo Video.

The former second overall selection has had his fair share of troubles in Philadelphia, but it was never really a fit, especially last season.
 Nolan Patrick’s entire existence as a member of the Philadelphia Flyers has been a weird one. With overcorrection and hope that he would be worthy of his second overall status, or just plain hatred towards him for suffering through multiple injuries and not being the answer for an aging core of forwards—even at just 22 years old he was seen as washed up.
Well, now we don’t really have to worry about him anymore, as he was eventually shipped off to the Vegas Golden Knights after being a part of the package for top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis. Who knew that his draft pedigree could carry him that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many effects of human-driven climate change is that, on average, the bodies of animals are getting smaller — birds, fish, deer, frogs, rodents, insects. And these changes could have large and unpredictable consequences.
“That’s the problem with human-driven climate change. It’s the rate of change that’s just orders of magnitude faster than what the natural world has had to deal with in the past. Size is really important to survival, and you can’t just change that indefinitely without consequence. For one thing, I don’t think it’s feasible that species are going to be able to continue to get smaller and maintain things like a migration from one hemisphere to another.”
And since smaller bodies can hold fewer eggs, they result in fewer offspring, and a lower population size in the long run. For amphibians who need to keep their skin wet in order to breathe, shrinking can mean higher chances of drying out in a drought because their bodies absorb and hold smaller quantities of water.
But the more concerning consequences have to do with how this could destabilize relationships between species. Because shrinking plays out at different rates for different species, predators might have to eat more and more of shrinking prey, for example, throwing a finely-tuned ecosystem off balance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eve Spectrum bills itself as the first crowd-developed monitor, and it was in the works for quite some time ahead of launch. The Eve Spectrum is now shipping out and available, so we thought we'd test it out to see if it's worth picking up.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


There are three versions of the 27-inch Spectrum display. For $459, you can get a Spectrum QHD with a 144Hz refresh rate, while a 240Hz version is available for $609. A 4K version is also available with a 144Hz refresh rate, and this top-of-the-line version costs $799. The Spectrum stand for those who aren't using a VESA mount is an additional $99.



MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera has been testing the 4K 144Hz version, and he found the design to be minimal, clean, and subtle, and for video editing work, it performed well.



Colors were accurate and natural and viewing angles were solid, but there is some light bleed with blacks and contrast doesn't quite measure up to some other displays at this price point.



Gameplay was smooth thanks to the high refresh rate, and the high contrast and peak brightness made games look great. There were times, however, that the video feed would die, and it's unclear if the issue was a cable or a port.



The Eve Spectrum comes equipped with a single DisplayPort port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, along with an audio port. There's no Thunderbolt support, but with a 100W USB-C port, it can charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro.



There are few gaming monitors with these specs and HDMI 2.1, so for those who need these features, the Spectrum may be worth checking out. Make sure to watch the full video up above to see it in action.

Federighi admitted that Apple had handled last week's announcement of the two new features poorly, relating to detecting explicit content in Messages for children and CSAM content stored in iCloud Photos libraries, and acknowledged the widespread confusion around the tools:

The legislation would establish a common charging port for all mobile phones and other relevant devices in all European Union countries. The move is expected to primarily affect Apple, since many popular Android devices already feature USB-C ports.



In 2018, the European Commission tried to reach a final resolution on the issue but it failed to come into law. At the time, Apple warned that forcing a common charging port on the industry would stifle innovation and create electronic waste as consumers were forced to switch to new cables.





	
The EU Wants All Phones to Work With Interoperable Chargers, Here’s What That Means for Apple's Lightning Port






A European Commission impact assessment study conducted in 2019 found that half of all charging cables sold with mobile phones had a USB micro-B connector, 29 percent had a USB-C connector, and 21 percent had a Lightning connector. The study suggested five options for a common charger, with various options that cover ports on devices and ports on power adapters.



Last year, the debate was reignited as the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of a common charger, citing less environmental waste and user convenience as the main benefits.



The executive branch of the European Union is currently drafting the legislation, according to sources speaking to Reuters, which is expected to be presented next month.

According to Reuters, an unspecified number of Apple employees have taken to internal Slack channels to raise concerns over CSAM detection. Specifically, employees are concerned that governments could force Apple to use the technology for censorship by finding content other than CSAM. Some employees are worried that Apple is damaging its industry-leading privacy reputation.

Eight students had sued the university, saying the requirement
violated their constitutional rights to “bodily integrity,
autonomy and medical choice.” But they conceded that exemptions to
the requirement — for religious, ethical and medical reasons — “virtually guaranteed” that anyone who sought an exemption would
be granted one.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who oversees the federal appeals court
in question, turned down the student’s request for emergency
relief without comment. She acted on her own, without referring
the application to the full court, which was an indication that
the application was not on solid legal footing.

Run a radio station, play D&D, and try out a dating app
 Life is Strange: Wavelengths is a prequel to the upcoming Life is Strange: True Colors, and it has a super cozy vibe. Wavelengths is a DLC addition to True Colors, and it doesn’t seem to touch at all on the main mystery of Gabe Chen. Instead, we’re in the shoes of Steph, a young DJ who’s looking to make a mark in the world. Steph’s story plays out over four seasons, and we get to find out more about her and her life before we head into the main plot.
True Colors stars Alex Chen, a young woman who moves to a new city and ends up investigating the death of her brother. Alex is accompanied on her investigation by a supporting cast, which includes Steph, who also showed up in Before the Storm. Wavelengths gives us a little more background on who Steph is, and that may influence the choices players make throughout the story of True Colors.
The soundtrack includes songs from Girl in Red, Alt-J, Portugal, The Man, Foals, Hayley Kiyoko, and Maribou State. As Steph becomes more comfortable as a DJ, the player gets to see other aspects of her life. This includes running a D&D game with a friend, using the D20 to give callers advice on the radio, and swiping left or right on profiles during Pride month. 
The entire DLC looks incredibly cozy, and it’ll be interesting to see how it adds to the main story. True Colors is set to be released on Sept. 10; Wavelengths will release soon after on Sept. 30.]]></summary>

Well, this one is seven and a half minutes long and I still wish it had gone on for longer. Ok sure, you get the point after awhile, but each successive animation is just as inventive than the last that it kept me hooked.

No, my spectral charge is ALSO named Bort
 League of Legends is in an interesting spot right now when it comes to lore, as its big world-spanning event has come to a close. Now that the Sentinels of Light have put down the Ruined King and saved the world, things should be pretty peaceful, right? Well, the event left a lot of loose threads hanging, like the fate of characters like Karma, Shyvana, or Thresh. On Thursday, Riot released a new cinematic that answers at least a few of those questions.
The cinematic stars Thresh, who is a spectral warden from the Shadow Isles. In the Sentinels of Light event, he gathered up all of the power from Viego’s scary invasion and used it to craft himself a different form. With this new, mostly human form, Thresh is free to wander the world. This cinematic is an immediate follow-up that shows us what he’s doing with his freedom, and it’s nothing good! He’s back to shackling and torturing souls inside his scary lantern, but at least he’s appointing middle management to help out. In this case, that’s an unfortunate tavern keep called Bort with a crab claw for an arm.
This cinematic also shows Thresh in a different light than his in-game splash art. Instead of having his sick abs out for everyone to admire, he appears much more sinister and skeletal in this one. Even when he’s just in the tavern, pretending to be a normal guy, you can tell there’s something off there. It’s a great rendition of the character, and it’ll be intriguing to see where his story leads.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charles Gaba:
One thing I’ve been noting is that the R-squared (coefficient of
determination) for the graphs at both the state & county levels
seems to have been inching up higher over the past month or two
… that is, the outlier counties seem to be gradually moving
closer to the graph’s trend line.
Furthermore, the slope of the trend line seemed to be moving
upwards as well over time. Both of these mean that not only is
there a clear correlation between a county’s 2020 partisan lean
and how quickly their residents are getting vaccinated, that
correlation is only increasing over time.
I decided to check to see whether this was an anomaly (just a
temporary thing) or not by going back to the county-level
vaccination data all the way back to February 1st, 2021. At that
point supplies of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were
ramping up, but getting vaccinated was still limited mostly to
senior citizens 65 and older in the United States.
The whole series of charts is telling, but the last one — the animated one that shows how the partisan divide is increasing over time — is startling. The vaccinated aren’t going to forget this.

Early on, the McIlvaines spoke to a therapist who warned them that each member of their family would grieve differently. Imagine that you’re all at the top of a mountain, she told them, but you all have broken bones, so you can’t help each other. You each have to find your own way down.
It was a helpful metaphor, one that may have saved the McIlvaines’ marriage. But when I mentioned it to Roxane Cohen Silver, a psychology professor at UC Irvine who’s spent a lifetime studying the effects of sudden, traumatic loss, she immediately spotted a problem with it: “That suggests everyone will make it down…]]></summary>

Another chance to meet Clyde, Tommy, and CJ
 Rockstar Games may be releasing remasters of three classic Grand Theft Auto Games, according to a report from Kotaku. This remains unconfirmed, but the remastered version of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are rumored to arrive on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and mobile devices.
Kotaku’s report suggests that the games will be “a mix of new and old graphics,” akin to a “heavily-modded version of a classic GTA title.” The UI of the games will be updated for clarity as well, though it’ll remain the classic visual style. Gameplay is expected to remain as close as possible to the original iterations.
These three titles are part of the “3D universe” of Rockstar Games, which include the PS2 era of Grand Theft Auto before the series moved into high definition with Grand Theft Auto 4. While these games aren’t quite as fleshed out or involved as Rockstar’s modern titles, they still remain classics. Lines from San Andreas, like CJ’s iconic “Ah, shit, here we go again,” remain a popular part of the zeitgeist.
Kotaku says Rockstar Dundee, a Scottish studio, is heading up development on these remastered titles. It’s unclear when they might be released, especially due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it seems as though it will likely be in one bundle.
Rockstar also reportedly has plans for a Red Dead Redemption remaster.
We’ve reached out to Rockstar for comment, and will update this story should it respond with additional information.]]></summary>

Oil replaces coal in a sequel just as brutal as the original
 Oil is coming to the apocalyptic world of Frostpunk in 11 bit studios’ reveal trailer for Frostpunk 2. The sequel takes place 30 years after the story in the original game, and will see players lead another society through the newly imposed ice age. Societies that were once built on coal will now be built on oil, and leaders will need quiet any rebellions that question their rule.
The original Frostpunk launched to critical acclaim in 2018 on PC; 11 bit studios eventually ported the game to consoles and added numerous expansion packs. In Frostpunk, players build a circular city centered around an engine. The world is frozen over, and citizens need to gather coal to increase the engine’s output or r…]]></summary>

Michael K. Williams returns as ‘Irish’ from Battlefield 4
 Battlefield 2042 won’t feature a traditional narrative single-player campaign, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carry over storytelling elements from previous games — or that it won’t tell stories of its own. In a newly released short film titled “Exodus,” developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts set up the story of Battlefield 2042 and confirm the return of a beloved character: Battlefield 4’s Kimble “Irish” Graves, once again played by Michael K. Williams.
The nine-minute film appears to confirm a canonical ending for 2013’s Battlefield 4: that Irish, not Huang “Hannah” Shuyi, survives the events of that game’s campaign. As such, Irish will be a playable “No-Pat” Specialist in Battlefield 2042. 
“Exodus” also introduces a new character to Battlefield lore named Oz. He clashes with Irish over the future of the No-Pats — 2042’s nickname for the non-patriated soldiers who fight in the upcoming game’s global conflict. EA said in a news released that the story of Battlefield 2042 will “continue to evolve over time” and will be told through future playable specialists — not unlike how EA’s Apex Legends or Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch handle their storytelling.
Irish is the fifth confirmed specialist coming in Battlefield 2042, following Casper, Mackay, Boris, and Falck, who were revealed in June. Battlefield 2042 is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple will likely unveil its next-generation iPhones next month, and ahead of time, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce has outlined its expectations for the devices.





TrendForce said its latest investigations indicate that some of the notable hardware upgrades for the iPhone 13 models will include a faster and more power efficient 5nm+ chip that will presumably be named the A15 Bionic, support for mmWave 5G in additional countries outside the United States, and space-saving internal circuitry that will likely allow for larger batteries inside the devices. All of these features have been rumored previously.



As for pricing, TrendForce believes the iPhone 13 series will be priced similarly as the iPhone 12 series, assuming that Apple is able to effectively control manufacturing costs, due to the lack of many significant hardware upgrades. While the iPhone 12 series was announced in October last year, likely due to pandemic-related delays, the research firm said Apple will return to a September release for the iPhone 13 series this year.



TrendForce said iPhone shipments will likely maintain a growth trajectory in the third quarter of 2021 following the launch of the iPhone 13 series.

Vanguard will take players back to World War II
 Call of Duty fans appear to be heading back to World War II later this year with the next entry in the franchise, which is called Call of Duty: Vanguard, according to leaked images posted online.
Charlie Intel reports that the new season 5 update for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War contained some hidden files showcasing pre-order details for 2021’s Call of Duty title. Data miners pulled the images and started sharing them online. Activision has met some of these posts with copyright takedown notices, forcing them to be removed.
The images themselves seem legitimate, suggesting that Call of Duty: Vanguard will be the game’s official title and that it will be set during WWII.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has teamed up with singer Billie Eilish on a new short film to promote Apple Music's recently launched Spatial Audio feature.






The 90-second video, created by Apple Music in close collaboration with Eilish, mashes up the songs "Getting Older" and "GOLDWING" from the artist's latest album "Happier Than Ever." Eilish is seen singing in front of a vanity mirror, and as the song transitions, her reflections start to multiply in additional mirrors surrounding her, which Apple said is a metaphor meant to represent what it's like to listen to Spatial Audio.



Apple said Spatial Audio takes the listening experience of the new album to new heights, bringing dimensionality to Eilish's vocal performance.



Based on Dolby Atmos, Spatial Audio provides a surround sound experience, making songs sound like they are coming from all around you. Thousands of Apple Music songs have been made available in Spatial Audio since the feature rolled out in June, including Lady Gaga's "Rain on Me" and Kanye West's "Black Skinhead," and Eilish's new "Happier Than Ever" album can also be listened to in the immersive audio format.

Like a flaming bag of dog poop passing in the night.
 A while back, I joked on Flyperbole that Flyers fans should erect a wall memorializing all of the awful defenseman the team has employed during the Claude Giroux era. Today, we take a look at an easy inductee for that unfortunate club in Erik Gustafsson, who was so terrible that the Flyers chose to healthy scratch him on occasion for the likes of Nate Prosser.



What exactly happened with Gustafsson this year that warranted frequent utterances of expletives from the mouths of fans? Let’s dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, has said it will begin construction of all-electric vehicle plants in the United States and Thailand this year, with hopes of them being operational by 2023, according to a report from Nikkei Asia.





From the report: 

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics producer, on Thursday said it will build electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Thailand next year, as the key iPhone assembler accelerates efforts to catch the rising EV wave to offset the slowing smartphone industry.



Foxconn has already ruled out Mexico as a location but is in negotiations with three states in the U.S. to build its first EV manufacturing plant in North America, Nikkei Asia has learned. Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.
At first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.



Apple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the Apple Car. One report vaguely referenced Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌Apple Car‌'s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers. Apple is reportedly committed to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ is produced in the United States, but Foxconn does not produce batteries.

In a paper highlighted on the Apple Machine Learning Research website and spotted by MyHealthyApple, researchers found that "wearable headphones" are able to pick up audible inhalations and exhalations during exertion using the device's on-board microphones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoom has introduced a new feature called Focus Mode that's designed to prevent students from distracting each other during virtual classrooms. 





When enabled, Focus Mode allows the teacher or lecturer taking the class to see all the students, while each student can only see the teacher. 



The setting can be activated at any time by the teleconferencing host, so for example it could be turned on for lecture periods to reduce distractions from students' video feeds and then turned off for group discussion.



Focus Mode is available on the free desktop Zoom client, therefore lending itself to other uses, like business meetings, family gatherings and so on. 





Zoom announced the new feature in a blog post offering other back-to-school tips to get children prepared for virtual or hybrid learning. Version 5.7.5 of Zoom for Mac is available to download from the Zoom website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly changing up the way it produces camera modules for its iPhone, now opting to individually produce each of the camera lenses separately, rather than procure them together and have them pre-assembled, according to a report from The Elec.





The report notes that up to last year, Apple's ‌iPhone‌ camera lenses were produced by its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film. The lenses were "pre-assembled." Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.

Up to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O'Film that are pre-assembled.



But it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.
Foxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System. The new system will check whether the wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras' lenses, including their optical axis and image sensors, are correctly aligned on higher-end ‌iPhone‌ models. An incorrect alignment could result in drastically reduced image quality.



The new changes are being done to "save costs," but it remains unclear if those savings would be presented to customers. It's also unclear whether the new production methodology and Foxconn's role in camera assembly will be in practice for the upcoming iPhone 13. Given that the new iPhones are already in production, that's unlikely to be the case.

Panzarino: One of the bigger queries about this system is
that Apple has said that it will just refuse action if it is asked
by a government or other agency to compromise by adding things
that are not CSAM to the database to check for them on-device.
There are some examples where Apple has had to comply with local
law at the highest levels if it wants to operate there, China
being an example. So how do we trust that Apple is going to hew to
this rejection of interference if pressured or asked by a
government to compromise the system?

The biggest change in this patch is the assault rifle balance update, which touches several different weapons in the category. The weapon with the most changes is the XM4 rifle, which has several attachments adjusted to help give each attachment a more unique role.

Welcome to Bandle City
 The world of Legends of Runeterra is about to get a whole lot cuter. On Wednesday, Riot Games released an animated trailer revealing the next set of champions and locations from League of Legends to come to the franchise’s card game. Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards. This includes 9 new champions, including some from outside Bandle City like the Piltover sheriff Caitlyn.
The new expansion will also have new keywords that reflect the whimsical nature of the Yordles. In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.
It also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her. However, the bulk of the Bandlewood expansion should focus on yordles and their mischief. Beyond the Bandlewood is set to release on Aug. 25.]]></summary>

Install the 5G Preferred Over Wi-Fi profile ("profile") on devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 Beta 4 or greater to greatly increase the likelihood of seeing 5G preferred over Wi-Fi connections and to ensure your networking path logic is optimized for situations where 5G will be preferred. For more information, see https://developer.apple.com/5g/.
Apple says that developers who want to prioritize 5G usage on their devices can do so by running the fourth beta of ‌iOS 15‌/‌iPadOS 15‌ or later and downloading the 5G Preferred Over WiFi Profile.



In iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple has already added a new feature that causes 5G devices to automatically prioritize 5G when it provides an improved connection over WiFi, so this developer tool should boost that capability even further.

New publisher Motorsport Games calls this a from-scratch product, built with two new engines
 Stock car racing is coming back to consoles and PC this fall and, appropriately enough, there’s a new engine under the hood.
NASCAR 21: Ignition, made in Unreal 4, will launch Oct. 28 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. It’s the second NASCAR title published by new label Motorsport Games, a subsidiary of the global media company Motorsport Network, best known for its Motorsport.com website.

The fifth beta comes two weeks after Apple released the fourth macOS Monterey beta, and it is available to both developers and public beta testers. 





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. Public beta testers can install the proper profile from Apple's public beta testing website. 



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.

The next big sensation might be here
 Hell Let Loose looks generic at first glance — it’s a World War II shooter with tanks, guns, and explosions. If you’re not paying attention and you click on a random stream of the game, it looks like a scene you’ve seen a hundred times before. But developer Black Matter expertly threads the genre needle between goofy, Looney Tunes multiplayer chaos and hardcore military sim precision, resulting in one of the best online shooters around right now.
Hell Let Loose is very clever with its simple premise. It's a 50 vs. 50 battle, and the map is divided into sections. Players win by taking over the sections and out-maneuvering the enemy. There are traditional classes, like Scout, Medic, Engineer, Officer, or Tank Commande…]]></summary>

1. Joyous Exploration. This is the prototype of curiosity — the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.
2. Deprivation Sensitivity. This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.
3. Stress Tolerance. This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.


They also identified four types of curious people: The Fascinated, Problem Solvers, Empathizers, and Avoiders. (via the art of noticing)

This is incredibly serious business
 The latest Dead by Daylight patch looks pretty normal at first glance — there’s a buff to K-Pop killer the Trickster, and a host of bug fixes. But if you look a little closer, you’ll see a suspicious note that reads, “Fixed an issue that caused The Executioner’s rear to be too flat.”
The Executioner is Pyramid Head, the iconic Silent Hill villain. When he joined the fray back in June of 2020, fans celebrated his enormous ass. Dead by Daylight is all about being chased by a host of nefarious Killers, and some people like it when those Killers have a big butt. When developer Behaviour tweaked the Killer’s blood-stained smock, fans raised a fuss about how it looked. Had the developers dared to touch that perfect behind…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has begun selling a new third-party accessory for its MagSafe ecosystem, a folding stand from OtterBox priced at $39.95. The hinged stand includes a recessed area to house a user-provided ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and a slot for routing the cable through the stand and out the back.





The folding design is convenient for travel and lets you set your desired angle for nightstand viewing, video calls, and more in either portrait or landscape orientation. When folded completely back into a horizontal position, it can serve as a traditional Qi charger for non-MagSafe devices such as AirPods or other smartphones.



At $39.95 for the stand and an additional $39.00 for Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, it's not an inexpensive charging solution, but the removable charger setup does offer flexibility to only use the stand when needed.

Taking the train toward adventure
 Eastward, a charming adventure title from Shanghai developer Pixpil, will come to Nintendo Switch this September. The release was announced at Wednesday’s Nintendo Indie World showcase. Eastward was originally announced in 2018 and is planned for Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac.
The game takes place in a fantasy world where society is on the brink of collapse and the population is declining. The player assumes the role of protagonists John and Sam, and uses their unique abilities to explore cozy towns, mysterious lairs, and toxic wastes. The world is plagued by a toxic miasma, and humanity has fled underground. John and Sam — a miner and a mysterious young girl with a frying pan and kinetic powers, respectively — decide to see what has happened to the world outside of the underground sanctuaries and set out on a road trip across the rails. 
Eastward is published by Chucklefish, who also published Stardew Valley and Risk of Rain, as well as developed Starbound and Wargroove. Eastward seems to fit perfectly within that portfolio, and fans will be able to crack into the strange world this September.]]></summary>

A slightly more tactical twist on the run-and-gun franchise
 Metal Slug Tactics is coming to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo announced that the latest game in the Metal Slug franchise is on its way to the platform during its August Nintendo Indie World event. 
Metal Slug is known for its run-and-gun shooting, but the latest entry switches things up a bit with turn-based tactical gameplay. Metal Slug Tactics is all about approaching fights strategically and placing your troops in the correct positions for special bonuses. The game also adds roguelike elements to help keep each run fresh. 
But not everything about Metal Slug Tactics is new. The game still keeps the pixel-art graphics fans are used to from the Metal Slug franchise, along with some of its characters like Marco, Tarma, Fio, and Eri. Of course, since it’s a Metal Slug game, there are still plenty of guns and explosions too.
Metal Slug Tactics is set to come to Nintendo Switch and PC sometime in 2022.]]></summary>

Tom Happ’s sequel to his 2015 Metroidvania available in eShop
 And just like that, Axiom Verge 2 arrives today for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC.
Tom Happ’s long-anticipated sequel to his acclaimed 2015 Metroidvania will be available Wednesday in the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Store, and Epic Games Store. Axiom Verge 2 was shown during Wednesday’s Indie World showcase with a new trailer (above). 
In the first Axiom Verge, the player character is a researcher named Trace, who awakens from a laboratory accident on an alien world. As Trace, the player explores a glitched-out landscape, repairing code to continue their progress through each level.
Axiom Verge 2 was announced during an Indie World presentation in 2019, and originally scheduled to launch in the fall of 2020. However, it was delayed twice, most recently in May, and given a launch window for the third quarter of this year.
Happ is still largely the project’s sole developer; it took him five years to deliver the first Axiom Verge. That was a PlayStation 4 game when it launched in 2015, and was later ported to Wii U in 2016 and then the Switch in 2017.
A documentary about the first game’s creation was published in 2017; Happ made it free to watch via IGN back in May.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-08-11T16:10:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular to-do app Things reached version 3.14 today and gained several additional note-related features: Bullet Lists, Markdown support, Find in Text, and Things Cloud "Fractus."





Things has supported bullet lists before now, but you can now nest lists by inserting spaces in front of a bullet, and character lines now line up with the text of the previous line, thanks to the use of a fixed-width font.



When editing bullet lists, Things will now make the process a little easier by automatically stripping out "double bullets" during copy-paste.



Meanwhile, there's a new Find in Text option that augments the existing search by searching specific notes. The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. 



In addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.





Lastly, Things Cloud "Fractus" is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. 



With Things Cloud "Fractus", however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. 



Things 3.14 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $49.99 and from the iOS App Store. The iPad version is priced at $19.99 [Direct Link] while the iPhone version (which includes Apple Watch support) is priced at $9.99. [Direct Link] A 15-day trial of Things for Mac is available on the Cultured Code website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The YouTube channel In Depth Cine has been looking at how directors like Spike Lee, Alfonso Cuarón, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson shoot films at three different budget levels, from the on-a-shoestring films early in their careers to later blockbusters, to see the similarities and differences in their approaches. For instance, Wes Anderson made Bottle Rocket for $5 million, Rushmore for $10 million, and Grand Budapest Hotel for $25 million:

Steven Spielberg shot Duel for $450,000, Raiders of the Lost Ark for $20 million, and Saving Private Ryan for $70 million:

Christopher Nolan did Following for $6,000, Memento for $9 million, and Inception for $160 million:

You can find the full playlist of 3 Budget Levels videos here. (This list really needs some female directors — Ava DuVernay, Sofia Coppola, and Kathryn Bigelow would be easy to do, for starters. And Chloé Zhao, after The Eternals gets released.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest hurdles for customers looking to switch between Android and iOS is their inability to transfer their WhatsApp chats between the two different ecosystems. Now, that's coming to an end, as WhatsApp has officially announced that it will easily allow users to transfer their chats between Android and iOS.





As reported first by Engadget, WhatsApp used airtime during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event to announce the new feature. WhatsApp tested the feature for the past few weeks and said it was difficult to implement due to "end-to-end encryption," requiring added assistance to make it work. 



The feature will first arrive on Android devices, specifically Samsung smartphones, allowing users to initially transfer chats from iOS to Samsung smartphones. The transfer will include the chat itself, photos, videos, and voice memos, and should be available to Samsung users in the "coming weeks." WhatsApp has not said when the feature will arrive for a wider range of WhatsApp devices and on iOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlueJeans Telehealth has today announced that it will integrate with Apple's Health app to give more contextual information to healthcare providers.





BlueJeans Telehealth is a HIPAA-ready virtual care system that provides a way for healthcare providers to meet with their patients via a video call, integrating with the workflows of clinical teams to replicate the experience of onsite encounters.



The BlueJeans Telehealth app will now allow patients to share specific categories of health data from Apple's Health app, including heart rate, ECGs, step count, mobility data, sleep, and falls, with their healthcare provider during telehealth appointments, via HealthKit. 



Patients can specifically control which encrypted health data they wish to share while supplying healthcare providers with additional information to give more informed advice.



Health data can be selected within the pre-visit patient landing experience or through the televisit tile during the session. Once synced, the healthcare provider will be able to see, expand, and interact with the Apple Health app data, allowing them to observe trends and highlight data on-screen for the patient.

Viewers are encouraged to get involved simply with an iPhone and the Clips app, but may also wish to take advantage of a selfie stick or tripod.



The session covers how to make a simple loop video, match your movement, add an unexpected feature, finalizing looped videos, top takeaways, and export videos.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌iPhone‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the third Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with the first exploring how to draw yourself as a "Peanuts" character in the Pages app using an ‌iPad‌ and ‌Apple Pencil‌ and the second explaining how to shoot and edit "otherworldly" photos with Night Mode.

The former third-round pick finished up his final season in Philadelphia trending up, but not enough to prevent him from being dealt away as part of a defensive overhaul. 
 After the Flyers failed to quality for the 2020-21 Stanley Cup playoffs, GM Chuck Fletcher set out to overhaul a underperforming defensive group — one that had included Shayne Gostisbehere for the better part six-plus seasons. 
The 28-year-old, who narrowly lost out on the Calder Trophy back in a breakout 2015-16 season, was no longer in Fletcher’s plans moving forward on defense and was dealt to the Arizona Coyotes for the low price of second and seventh-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple announced earlier this year that, with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the Find My Network will be able to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the AirPods to a specific Apple ID, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌'s speaker holes to remove the linked account.





First spotted by 9to5Mac, iOS 15 developer beta five code has confirmed that, to work with Apple's ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else's ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner's ‌Apple ID‌.



To remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.



For ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.



Support for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.



Previously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device's location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mozilla has announced the public release of Firefox 91, featuring an enhanced version of its Total Cookie Protection for individual websites.





When you browse the web on your devices, websites will often leave cookies on your system so that they can remember you and what your preferences are.



Some cookies are genuinely useful, as they allow sites to save your personal information (such as your login credentials) so that you don't have to keep entering it every time you visit. However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. 





To combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can't track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.



With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.



Firefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.





For Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -> Privacy & Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using "Clear cookies and site data" in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.



In addition, there's a new "Forget About This Site" option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.



Firefox 91 is available now from the Mozilla website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Corellium, the security research company that provides security researchers with a replica of the iOS operating system, allowing them to locate possible security exploits within Apple's mobile operating system, The Washington Post reports.





Apple filed a lawsuit against Corellium in 2019, claiming the security company was infringing upon its copyrights of iOS and iPhone. Last year, a judge dismissed Apple's claim that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant's copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. 



While Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.



Citing court documents, The Washington Post reports that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple's grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.



Likely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year launched a program that would give security researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching security vulnerabilities and exploits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week began selling refurbished 8th-generation iPad models through its online store in the United States for the first time since the device was released last year. As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.





Apple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.



Introduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.



Refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.



Apple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week. While certified refurbished iPads represent a decent opportunity for savings straight from Apple, better deals are sometimes available from resellers like Amazon and Best Buy. Be sure to monitor our Apple Deals roundup for the latest discounts on Apple products.

A modder added the popular traversal tool to another open-world game
 No, that’s not Link floating across the land of Skyrim. It’s the Dragonborn. 
Thanks to a new mod that adds Link’s paraglider from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Skyrim, you can now float across the land just like the hero of time would. The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. 
The “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. 
In the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.
Similar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. 
The mod doesn't add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.
Cognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.
The power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.


I particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:
Daily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.


For more information on how caffeine enabled the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, check out Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses.

Players who pre-ordered get in Aug. 13, general public can play Aug. 20
 Diablo 2: Resurrected’s multiplayer beta begins this weekend, Blizzard announced on Tuesday. Players who pre-ordered the remaster of the 2000 dungeon crawler will get in on an early access weekend starting Friday afternoon, with the public open beta following the next weekend.
The early access period starts Friday, Aug. 13 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and is available to those with a pre-order for Diablo 2: Resurrected or the Diablo Prime Evil Collection (a special edition with some extra in-game stuff for $20 more).
The open beta starts Friday, Aug. 20 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT. This beta and the early access beta include all platforms except Nintendo Switch. Players may try out cross-progression support on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions.
Blizzard says both betas will allow players to try out five classes: Paladin, Druid, Barbarian, Amazon, and Sorceress. The multiplayer component will support up to eight players in PvP or PvE play.
Both beta periods will be limited to the game’s Act I: The Sightless Eye and Act II: The Secret of the Vizjerei. But there will be no level cap, so players can try out a variety of builds for as long as they want to progress in these two acts.
Blizzard’s official blog post has more details. Diablo 2: Resurrected launches Sept. 23.
Blizzard first announced Diablo 2: Resurrected at BlizzConline earlier this year. At the time, executive producer Rod Ferguson stressed that Resurrected is a remaster, not a remake. 
In a technical alpha held in April, we found Diablo 2 was just as faithful a re-release as Blizzard had promised, and that its controller support made all the difference for newer players.]]></summary>

Most importantly, buying an Apple TV no longer gives users a
content advantage. We are in the age of streaming services like
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, and business models have
shifted so that every service is available on every device — phones, tablets, TV sets, streaming sticks and game consoles.
Apple, known for its closed ecosystem, is even embracing the shift
by offering many services on smart TVs and boxes made by
competitors. […] That made the Apple TV a mostly pointless
accessory, and consumers seem to agree: 2020 data from Strategy
Analytics found that the Apple TV holds 2% of the streaming
device market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the FT, Tim Harford writes about things that could have been invented far sooner than they actually were.
Consider the bicycle. It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.
Anton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.
Steven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.

A refresher on Apple's new child safety features from our previous coverage:
First, an optional Communication Safety feature in the Messages app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac can warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos. When the feature is enabled, Apple said the Messages app will use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments, and if a photo is determined to be sexually explicit, the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned.

A promising cyberpunk shooter without the confidence to see things through
 There’s no denying it: The Ascent has style. It’s drenched in neon and thrumming with decay. What’s not coated in chrome is swallowed by rust, and though it draws on the usual cyberpunk influences — Neo-Tokyo, Midgar, dystopian Los Angeles, to name a few — I can’t help getting lost in its singular energy. 
Of course, style can go only so far. To quote William Gibson, “When you want to know how things really work, study them when they’re coming apart.” The Ascent frequently comes apart. It’s a collision of genres that, even at its best, can’t decide what it wants to be.

The new patch also lets players customize their crosshairs in even more detail
 Valorant’s first patch in nearly three weeks has arrived, and the biggest change is a bug fix that’s technically a huge nerf to Viper’s Ultimate. The patch also includes more customizable crosshairs, and the ability to shoot through more parts of maps than before. 
At the beginning of Valorant’s latest season, Riot released a patch that allowed Viper to place her Viper’s Pit Ultimate ability wherever her crosshair was pointing, rather than at her feet, like it was previously. This turned out to be a massive buff to the Agent, since she could place the ability in hard-to-reach places and throw it out while safe behind cover. The only problem was, Riot didn’t intend for this to happen. …]]></summary>

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there's a new "For All of You" recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

Homage to PC gaming warhorse of the 1990s comes with 25 titles, can sideload more
 The latest throwback mini console is an homage to a home computer — the Commodore Amiga 500, reborn as The A500 Mini from Retro Games Ltd, the same company behind 2018’s C64 Mini. The collector’s item/conversation piece will cost $139.99 when it goes on sale in early 2022, the 35th anniversary of the PC’s launch.
Classic gaming fans will find 25 Amiga staples in the A500’s onboard library of games — among them Interplay’s 1991 hit Another World, the 1993 point-and-click adventure Simon the Sorcerer, steampunk run-and-gunner The Chaos Engine (which was later ported to home consoles of the day), and Team 17’s 1995 hit Worms (as Worms: The Director’s Cut), which launched a franc…]]></summary>

Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and
it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a person in
sharp focus while blurring the background in what is known as a
bokeh effect. For the new iPhones, Apple plans to add this same
technique to video with a feature internally dubbed Cinematic
Video. Like with still photos, the iPhone’s depth sensor will
create the effect and allow users to change the amount of blur
after recording. […]

When asked why Apple is only choosing to implement child safety features that scan for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Neuenschwander explained that Apple has "now got the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy," giving the company "a new ability to identify accounts which are starting collections of known CSAM."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first part of a multi-video series on how the human immune system works, Kurzgesagt describes how the system’s first lines of defense work when your body is invaded by microorganisms.
The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know, after the human brain, and yet, most of us never learn how it works. Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. 
It is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.


Kurzgesagt founder Philipp Dettmer is publishing a companion book to the series, Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive; it’s out in late September.
I have read a lot about the human immune system over the past 18 months, but this video was still helpful in understanding how it all fits together. For more information, consult their extensive list of sources or watch their earlier video on what the SARS-CoV-2 virus does to a human body.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 iPhones and Macs may feature chips built on the 3nm process, as Apple's leading chip supplier, TSMC, is planning to begin mass production for 3nm chips destined for Apple in the second half of next year, according to a preview of an upcoming report by DigiTimes. 





The paywalled preview of the full report, which will be published tomorrow, reads: 

TSMC is on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022 for Apple's devices, either iPhones or Mac computers, according to industry sources.
Earlier in June, TSMC was reportedly beefing up capacity to begin production of 3nm chips, but DigiTimes at the time refrained from mentioning Apple as a potential initial beneficiary of the new process. Today's preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.



Apple has already reportedly booked TSMC's entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. 



The A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year's iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. 



The full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple's plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We'll be sure to let MacRumors' readers know if the new report shares anything of significance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple plans to launch a new MacBook Air with a mini-LED display and several color options around mid 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors. These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.




A colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser


Kuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an "all-new design" with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. 



Kuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.



Chinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. 



Apple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve South today announced a new addition to its PlugBug charger lineup with the launch of the PlugBug Slim, a new 20W USB-C charger that's useful for travel with its thin design.





Priced at $24.99, Twelve South describes the PlugBug Slim as a space-saving charger that's 0.67 inches thick (17mm), so it better blends into the wall and fits into tight spaces where furniture might be close to an outlet.



The prongs of the PlugBug Slim are designed to fold down so that it can be tucked into a pocket or slipped into a bag or purse when on the go, and there's a small light at the bottom to let you know when your device is charging.





The PlugBug Slim is a GaN charger, and while there are many GaN charging options on the market now with compact designs, there are fewer that have focused on a slimmer profile for small spaces. At 20W, the PlugBug Slim works with the iPhone models and offers fast charging, charges up the iPad, and supports the HomePod mini.



Twelve South's PlugBug Slim can be purchased from the Twelve South website for $24.99.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



This has been the most popular discount price on the AirPods Pro for 2021. We have seen the AirPods Pro dip below $189.99 in the past, but those were mainly for sales around the holidays and they've been extremely rare since then.




$59 OFF
AirPods Pro for $189.99





For the lower-cost model, only Amazon has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for $113.99, down from $159.00. This new sale price beats the previous popular deal on the AirPods by about $6, and it's the best deal online right now.




$45 OFF
AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $113.99





Lastly, the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is marked down to $129.98 at Walmart, from $199.00, which is an all-time low on this model of the AirPods. It is being matched at Amazon, but due to stock shortages you won't see a shipping date in August at that retailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two popular Japanese prepaid money cards will be gaining support for Apple Pay later this year, allowing the cards to be added to the Wallet app for contactless payments using an iPhone or Apple Watch where accepted, it was announced today. 





The cards set to gain Apple Pay support include Seven & I's Nanaco card and AEON's WAON card, as noted by Ata Distance. The blog, which focuses on mobile payment and transit cards in Japan, believes it will likely become possible to add the cards to the Wallet app shortly after the public release of iOS 15, which is expected in September.





As part of its Apple Pay announcement, Seven & I said it has issued around 74 million Nanaco cards that are accepted at around 800,000 retail locations in Japan, including 7-Eleven and Ito-Yokado stores. Likewise, AEON said it has issued over 87 million WAON cards that are accepted at more than 840,000 retail locations across the island country.  



Apple Pay continues to expand to more issuers around the world, including ING in Belgium and FNB in South Africa earlier this month.

 The Flyers had a letdown season in 2020-21, but perhaps no single player had a more brutal year in terms of on-ice performance than Phil Myers. Coming off of a promising 2019-20 campaign where he flashed talent befitting a second pair defender, the 24-year-old right hander hugely underwhelmed and at points didn’t even look like an NHL player. Now traded to the Nashville Predators in a package including Nolan Patrick for Ryan Ellis, Myers is no longer a player that Flyers fans really need to invest their attention in. That said, it’s important to investigate what led to his eventual departure from Broad Street. Let’s dig in.

In an extensive Twitter thread, Stamos said that there are "no easy answers" in the debate around child protection versus personal privacy.



Stamos expressed his frustration with the way in which Apple handled the announcement of the new features and criticized the company for not engaging in wider industry discussions around the safety and privacy aspects of end-to-end encryption in recent years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple display supplier Samsung is in the early stages of preparing its production line for OLED displays that are expected to be used in future models of the MacBook Pro, according to new information shared today by The Elec.





The report says that Samsung Display has begun early development of a new production process for OLED displays. This new production capacity will be used by Apple for future OLED MacBooks, according to the report. 



DigiTimes has reported that Apple is tentatively scheduled to release a 16 to 17-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022. Apple is also reportedly planning a 10.9-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro with OLED displays for the same year. 



Apple just this year released a new ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display and is expected to be just weeks away from launching updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with similar display technology. DigiTimes said that Apple would allow ‌iPad‌ and MacBook models with OLED and mini-LED displays, which are considerably different technologies, to coexist within their respective product lineups. 



Apple currently uses OLED displays in its flagship iPhones, Apple Watch models, and the Touch Bar in the current MacBook Pros. The company has yet to expand OLED technology to other products.

It's worth noting from the off that the versions of Windows that Parallels 17 can run on an M1 Mac are currently limited to the Insider Previews for Windows 10 and Windows 11, due to their compatibility with ARM-based hardware. However, Parallels has promised that when Windows 11 is officially released to the public, the virtualization software will be able to run it.



With that caveat, for both ‌M1‌ and Intel systems, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38% faster compared to the previous version, and benefits from a sixfold increase in OpenGL graphics processing …]]></summary>

macOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.
This is the primary reason Retrobatch isn't sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I've considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can't bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.
Every year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Arcade recently surpassed over 200 games available on the subscription-based gaming service, and Apple today previewed two additional titles coming soon. Apple did not provide a specific release date for either game.




Zookeeper World


"Zookeeper World" from Kiterestu is a new installment in the "Zookeeper" action puzzle game series that will be available exclusively on Apple Arcade. Players will face a variety of challenging match-3 puzzles and collect coins while placing animals, equipment, and plants to increase the zoo's charm to attract more visitors. Players will be able to expand and customize their zoo, upgrade their animals to be unique, and more.



"Zen Pinball Party" from Zen Studios is a pinball game that will feature table designs inspired by DreamWorks Animation and Hasbro brands. Players will challenge their friends and family for the highest score on tables featuring Trolls, Kung-Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, MY LITTLE PONY, Theatre of Magic, Attack from Mars, and more.






In addition, Apple Arcade roleplaying game "Fantasian" from Mistwalker will be receiving a "Part 2" update on Friday. Apple says the latter half of the saga will feature a more quest-driven style of gameplay that can take anywhere between 40 to 60 hours for players to experience. The game was written by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.




Fantasian


Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

Campaign versus mode not part of Turtle Rock’s L4D spiritual successor
 Turtle Rock Studios’ Back 4 Blood is wrapping up its early access preview on Monday — an open beta will follow on Aug. 12 — which has given players a sneak peek at the studio’s Left 4 Dead successor. As part of that early access preview, Back 4 Blood players learned something new about the co-op zombie shooter: The game won’t feature a campaign versus mode, as previous Left 4 Dead games have. 
Campaign versus was one of the multiplayer bedrocks of Left 4 Dead, so its exclusion from Back 4 Blood is surprising and, for many prospective players, disappointing. In campaign versus mode, two teams of four players (one side as the survivors, one side a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2020 Summer Olympics are over, but it’s never too late to find inspiration in the athletes who competed. For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.
“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”


Armanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:
Those distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”

Bungie has slid its way into a new controversy 
 Bungie revealed a host of new changes coming to Destiny 2 last Thursday, and naturally, fans are pissed. But Destiny players aren’t mad that their favorite gun is getting nerfed or about the bevy of changes coming to various subclasses. No, Destiny players are mad about sliding changes. 
Sliding is a way of life in Destiny 2. While useful in PvE for moving quickly and dodging bullets, it’s most commonly seen in The Crucible, Destiny’s PvP mode. Sliding helps players move fast while lowering their profile, making it harder for enemy Guardians to track their movements. When paired with a shotgun, sliding becomes a powerful tool to surprise someone with a blast from the ground.

Upgrade planned for PC, but not for PS4 or Nintendo Switch versions
 Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice has been optimized for Xbox Series X and Series S. The upgrade is free for anyone who has the game, which includes subscribers to Xbox Game Pass. 
The upgrade is only for the new Xbox consoles. Hellblade studio Ninja Theory says an update for PC “is currently in development,” but there are no plans to offer it for any other platforms. Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Windows PC. Microsoft acquired Ninja Theory in June of 2018.
The optimized Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice gives players three visual fidelity settings — performance, resolution, and enriched, with the latter offering ray tracing on both Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Enriched mode supports dynamic resolutions up to 4K on Series X, and full HS on Series S, at 30 frames per second for both consoles.
Performance mode on Series X offers dynamic resolutions to 1080p at 120 Hz frame rates; it’s full HD and 60 fps on Series S. Resolution mode on Series X prioritizes dynamic resolutions to 4K, at 60 fps; Series S gets dynamic resolution support to 1440p at 30 fps.
“Also being added: Texture resolution bump, Chapter select, increased particle quality, increased draw distance, higher levels of detail,” the game’s official website says.
Ninja Theory said QLOC, the company behind Hellblade’s port to Nintendo Switch in 2019, handled the optimized version upgrade, freeing the studio to continue working on Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. In June, the studio indicated the sequel was still early in development, likely the reason why it wasn’t shown at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase for E3 2021 that month. Senua’s Saga was announced at The Game Awards in December 2019.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Check out Italian photographer Paolo Pettigiani’s photos of the evaporation ponds of Camargue, France. While these ponds are industrially harvested for their salt, the pink color of the water is naturally occurring in the salt marshes of the area, caused by halophile dunaliella salina algae. The area is also an important bird habitat and is one of the few places in Europe that flamingos live, which might seem like a coincidence until you learn that flamingos gain their pink color from eating the algae and shrimp that also feed on the algae.

The 12-inch form factor was considerably popular, as customers enjoyed its thin and light design. Apple updated the MacBook in 2016 and 2017 but discontinued it in 2019 following the launch of the redesigned MacBook Air with Retina Display.

Philadelphia got one restricted free agent locked up.
 Even after an already hectic offseason for Philadelphia Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher, he had two more things to do and with the team electing for salary arbitration with restricted free agent defenseman Travis Sanheim, it was really just one thing left to do. And on Monday, they did it.
Announced by the team, the Flyers have re-signed goaltender Carter Hart to a three-year contract with a cap hit of $3.979-million, a nod to his No. 79 jersey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple and Netflix are among the bidders for an "Oscar bait" film starring Jennifer Lawrence as the late Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers, according to Variety. Bidding for the film has reportedly surpassed $80 million and could climb higher.





Mengers was a prominent Hollywood "superagent" from the 1960s through the 1980s, representing some big names in acting like Barbra Streisand and Burt Reynolds. She was known for her outsized personality while trying to secure the best deal possible for her A-list clients. The film adaptation of her life is directed by Paolo Sorrentino, who won an Academy Award for Italian film "The Great Beauty" in 2014.  



Lawrence is best known for playing Katniss Everdeen in the "The Hunger Games" film series and Mystique in the "X-Men" film series, as well as starring in films like "Winter's Bone" and "American Hustle." Lawrence is also set to star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the upcoming Netflix film "Don't Look Up," which will tell the story of two low-level astronomers who must go on a media tour to warn mankind of an approaching comet that will destroy Earth.



Apple TV+ is in the midst of securing several star-studded original films, with the streaming service set to gain slavery thriller "Emancipation" starring Will Smith and the high-profile Western crime drama film "Killers of the Flower Moon" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Brendan Fraser, and several other big names.

Analyzing the 10th and final season in Philadelphia for the high production Czech winger.
 Following a disappointing 2020-21 season that saw the Flyers miss out on the Stanley Cup playoffs, we knew the team was headed for change — and part of that change involved roster staple Jake Voracek. 
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher ended Voracek’s 727-game career in Orange and Black by sending the soon-to-be 32-year-old to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for winger Cam Atkinson. It’s a homecoming of sorts for Voracek, who was drafted seventh overall by the BJ’s back in 2007 before being sent to Philadelphia — along with a pick that became Sean Couturier — for Jeff Carter in 2011. 



The trade put an end to a tremendous 10-year run for Voracek and…]]></summary>

Microsoft promises game updates, but not much else
 Microsoft is heading (virtually) to this year’s Gamescom, the annual video game expo normally held in Germany every summer, in the form of a livestream on Aug. 24. That’s one day before Gamescom 2021 officially begins on Aug. 25. This year’s expo will be entirely digital, just like last year.
The Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream can be viewed on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and Twitter on Aug. 24 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT/7 p.m. CEST.
The Xbox team promises “in-depth updates from some of our previously announced Xbox Game Studios titles alongside some of our third-party partners,” during its Gamescom 2021 stream. Expect Microsoft to focus on games scheduled for release this holiday season, like Halo Infinite, and titles coming to Xbox Game Pass.
Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing, reemphasized on Twitter that the stream is “focused on game updates coming this year.” Greenberg said viewers shouldn’t expect new reveals or major surprises, but teased “a fun stream.” (You can probably expect those new reveals and major surprises to show up during Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stream hosted by Geoff Keighley coming on Aug. 25 at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m PDT.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, version 14 feels like the biggest major release of BBEdit in many years. For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.
For everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:
You know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled
documents open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some
notes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s
amazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose
your carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,
but we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and
easier: Notes.
Notes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you
don’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you
don’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.
Notes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format
involved. […]
There are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits
your workflow and style.
Notes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).
See also:
Jason Snell, who wrote a nifty AppleScript that lets him drag an image into a Markdown file in BBEdit 14, and have it (a) upload that file to his server in the background, and (b) insert the Markdown syntax to reference that just-uploaded file.

Although it’s a great Ace Attorney game, it doesn’t stick the landing
 The Ace Attorney series has always been concerned with the definition of justice. For the last 20 years, the games’ lawyer protagonists have defended wrongfully accused clients while attempting to tackle the corruption and unfairness of what is ultimately a broken legal system. They have questioned and explored what a fair outcome within those constraints looks like, and the moral responsibility of an individual working with them.


The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, recently localized after five years as a Japanese-exclusive title, is a spinoff that takes place in England and Japan during the Victorian and Meiji era. (Though packaged as one game, it includes two games, The Great Ace Attorney: Ad…]]></summary>

Giant Ariana Grande saves the world
 Ariana Grande has come to Fortnite as a massive, glass-ceiling-shattering god. During Friday’s Rift Tour event, players got to play along in several minigames and experience new settings, all while a virtual version of the pop star performed some of her most famous songs. 
The in-game event started by dropping players onto a massive rainbow-colored slide, where they can pick up powers to make them go faster. As players slid and started to speed up, “Come and Go” by Marshmello ft. Juice Wrld played, kicking off the concert. From there, everyone got transported to a giant stuffed bear, where they could bounce around. Next, a giant crystal monster appeared and players are transported into an airplane to shoot him down, all while …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of three new games this morning, Apple's $4.99 per month Apple Arcade service now offers more than 200 games for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users to play.





The milestone was first highlighted by CNET, and it comes alongside the launch of Super Leap Day, Super Stickman Golf 3+, and Monster Hunter Stories+, all of which can be downloaded and played starting today.



‌Apple Arcade‌ first launched in September 2019, so it has taken just under two years for Apple to provide customers with 200 titles to choose from.



With ‌Apple Arcade‌, all of the games are free and there are no in-app purchase options or ads. The service is priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, and with that subscription price, all members of the family can access games. Apple also offers a one-month free trial for anyone, a three-month free trial for those who purchase an Apple device, and there are also often promotions for longer trial periods.



Apple has been working with both indie developers and big name gaming companies on ‌Apple Arcade‌ titles since it launched, and in April of this year, Apple began re-releasing classic titles like Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Mini Metro, Threes, and more.



‌Apple Arcade‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.



New titles are added to ‌Apple Arcade‌ on a regular basis, and in the near future, the service will be gaining "MasterChef: Let's Cook," "Layton's Mystery Journey+," "Asphalt Airborne 8+," "Baldo The Guardian Owls," "Tetris Beat," and "Wurdweb."

When you absolutely, positively must play every class or job in the game
 I’ve never been able to just jump into a game and just choose the play style or class that sounds the most fun. I always second-guess myself and get an itch to try something different. All class-based games present this kind of problem for me. MMOs typically require players to start over each time they want to try a different play style, adding restrictions that only further increase my analysis paralysis. But Final Fantasy 14 feels like it’s built for fiddly, indecisive players like me. 
In World of Warcraft, I’m known as an “altoholic,” a dismissive reference to a far more serious affliction. Altoholics like myself play multiple characters, sinking hours into different play styles. It’s …]]></summary>

 Another sponsor has pulled its endorsement from Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League.

The move is Kellogg’s response to allegations of gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment at Overwatch publisher and developer Blizzard Entertainment.
“We find these allegations troubling and inconsistent with our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said in a statement to Polygon. “While Activision Blizzard has announced plans to address the challenging issues it faces, we will not be moving forward with any new programs this year, but will continue to review …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today scored a victory in an ongoing patent dispute with Personalized Media Communications (PMC), with the judge overseeing the case tossing out the $308.5 million verdict that Personalized Media Communications won in March, reports Bloomberg.





Apple was a victim of PMC's plan to milk the tech industry for high royalties on old ideas, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said when delivering the verdict. The judge decided that PMC's patent for digital rights management is unenforceable because the company delayed its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to get more money.



PMC filed hundreds patent applications in the 1980s and 1990s, but no patents were awarded until 2010. The company took advantage of a loophole that allowed for an indefinite application process and then a patent valid for 17 years. This was addressed in 1995, but didn't apply to the patents used against Apple because they were filed earlier.



PMC delayed receiving its patents until after the technology in the patent had already been adopted, letting it make more money from tech companies.



Internal documentation from PMC suggested the company had thought that Apple would be a "natural candidate" to target with delayed patents, along with Intel, IBM, and Microsoft.



PMC won a $308.5 million verdict against Apple in March after a jury said that Apple infringed on DRM patents with its FairPlay technology that is used to distribute encrypted content through iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music.

How to easily get to Inazuma, in just six or seven mind-numbing hours
 Genshin Impact players have found a way to bust into the game’s newest location long before they’re supposed to. Players have tried fruitlessly to wiggle their way into the game’s newest region, Inazuma, by building massive ice bridges across vast stretches of open water, only to be foiled by developer Mihoyo’s explicit attempts to prevent that.
One truly dedicated player, however, discovered a method that combines clever manipulation of their internet connection with a character’s surprisingly useful ice attack.
Reddit user dezeadmf, known in-game as Meow, has made the long trek from Liyue Harbor, located near the southeastern part of Genshin Impact’s starting map, to Inazuma’s entry port, Ritou,…]]></summary>

Get three weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Bannerfall
3 wins — Exile’s Curse, Arc fusion rifle
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, Warlock class item)
7 wins — Igneous Hammer, Solar hand cannon
Flawless — The Messenger (Adept), Kinetic pulse rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spotify this week confirmed that its plans to add AirPlay 2 support to its iOS app have been placed on indefinite hiatus.





In an online discussion forum post, a Spotify representative said the streaming music service had been working on supporting AirPlay 2, but the company has paused the efforts "for now" due to "audio driver compatibility issues." The representative described AirPlay 2 support as a "bigger project that we won't be able to complete in the foreseeable future."



AirPlay 2 launched as part of iOS 11.4 in May 2018 with several enhancements to the original AirPlay wireless audio protocol, including multi-room audio, Siri voice control, and improved buffering. An app can support AirPlay 2 by implementing AVFoundation framework APIs, with a four-step process outlined on Apple's developer website.



Spotify has also yet to add native support for the HomePod (or its HomePod mini successor), despite Apple opening up the speaker to third-party music services last year. This is despite Spotify filing a complaint against Apple with the European Commission in March 2019 that accused the iPhone maker of "locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as Siri, HomePod, and Apple Watch." 



We've reached out to Spotify for comment and we'll provide an update if we hear back.

The Early Access game offers tons of tools for causing chaos
 One of my favorite parts of social sabotage games like Werewolf and Among Us is successfully fooling folks as the hidden agent. In many games, these moments are quick and brutal — a poor, unsuspecting victim finds themselves alone in a room with an impostor for just a minute, and things immediately go wrong. The creators of Dread Hunger, however, make you do things the slow way. It makes the game much tougher, tenser, and overall better.
In Dread Hunger, you set off on a 18th-century ship that breaks down in the Canadian Arctic and play as one of eight crewmates. Each has a certain role on the ship, like chaplain or cook. The characters are on a journey of discovery, but tw…]]></summary>

There are still some quality players without contracts...
 So the Flyers have had quite the busy off-season, huh?


Chuck Fletcher has certainly succeeded in re-tooling a roster that disappointed in 2020-21, and with the busiest periods of the offseason now finished, barring another trade most of the Flyers’ major business appears to be complete. They still need to sign two key restricted free agents in Carter Hart and Travis Sanheim, and with just over $8.0 million in cap space to spend, most of that room will be spent on those two players. 
Yet, if the Flyers do find themselves with leftover room, could they take a look at the remaining free agents on the market? Well it may be unlikely (especially if the Flyers are dead set on Nate …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple suppliers manufacturing the iPhone 13 models are struggling to hire enough workers ahead of the expected launch of new devices in September, according to the South China Morning Post.





In an attempt to attract workers to meet demand for the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, Apple suppliers in China are significantly raising their starter bonuses. Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, which is estimated to manufacture around 80 percent of the world's iPhones, has raised its new hires bonus to a record high of 10,200 yuan (U.S. $1,578).



Likewise, Lens Technology has doubled its bonus 5,000 yuan in February to 10,000 yuan in May, while Luxshare Precision's factory in Guangdong has doubled its internal referral bonus from 2,500 yuan in April to 5,000 yuan in May, with a top-up bonus of 3,800 yuan for returning workers who previously left the company.



Over the past three years, Apple has added more new suppliers from mainland China to its vendor list than any other country, but simultaneously the growth of China's labor force has peaked as factory jobs have started to lose their appeal and more workers move out of industrial labor, leading to companies having to lure in workers with more attractive pay packages.



The current aggressive hiring spree seeks to combat increasingly ramped-up production for the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first physical Apple retail store in India, promised by Apple CEO Tim Cook last year to open in 2021, has been delayed due to the worldwide health crisis, the company has confirmed to The Indian Express.





Last year, during an earnings call, Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ stated that his company plans to open its first official Apple Store in India by 2021. Clearly, due to the unforeseen and unpredictable challenges presented by the global health crisis, Apple has delayed its store opening in Mumbai.



In September, Apple tailored to its strong Indian customer base by opening an online store. This gave customers a direct way to purchase products from the company itself rather than from authorized retailers. 



In the past, Cook and other Apple executives have remarked on India's importance, including in the latest quarterly earnings call, stating that Apple had grown double-digits in India, along with a few other countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it is now allowing traders to use bank cards linked to Apple Pay to purchase crypto assets on the platform.




"Today, we're introducing new and seamless ways to enable crypto buys with linked debit cards to Apple Pay and Google Pay, and instant cashouts up to $100,000 per transaction available 24/7," said a Coinbase blog post on Thursday.



"If you already have a Visa or Mastercard debit card linked in your Apple Wallet, Apple Pay will automatically appear as a payment method when you're buying crypto with Coinbase on an Apple Pay-supported iOS device or Safari web browser."
In addition, Coinbase said it is also making it easier and faster for users to access their money by offering instant washouts via Real Time Payments (RTP), allowing customers in the U.S. with linked bank accounts to instantly and securely cash out up to $100,000 per transaction.



In June, Coinbase debit cards gained ‌Apple Pay‌ support, allowing it to be added to the Wallet app on iPhone. The Coinbase Card automatically converts the cryptocurrency that a user wishes to spend to U.S. dollars, and transfers the funds to their Coinbase Card for ‌Apple Pay‌ purchases and ATM withdrawals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple TV+ show "Physical," starring Rose Byrne, has been renewed for a second season, reports Deadline. The dark comedy, whose season one finale airs Friday, sees Byrne take the role of Sheila, a distressed housewife in the 1980s who transforms into an aerobics video star while her husband runs for political office.




"We couldn't be more proud to showcase Annie Weisman's singular take on this darkly funny, heartbreaking and bold story," said Michelle Lee, Director of Domestic Programming at Apple TV+. "And then we got to watch Rose Byrne inhabit this incredible, multi-layered character, giving us an unforgettable tour de force performance. We have been thrilled to see audiences around the world fall in love and feel seen by this show and we can't wait for everyone to experience the next chapter in Sheila's journey towards personal empowerment."
"Physical" was created by Annie Weisman, who has worked on shows like "About a Boy," "Suburgatory," "I Feel Bad," and "Desperate Housewives." The show is directed by "I, Tonya" director Craig Gillepsie, as well as Liza Johnson and Stephanie Laing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Cash, Apple's peer-to-peer payments service that works with Apple Pay and iMessage, received a couple of small updates on Thursday. 





It's now possible to use Instant Transfer with both Mastercard and Visa debit cards. Previously only the latter card could be used, so the addition of Mastercard means Instant Transfer is more accessible to users who want to quickly transfer money from an Apple Cash balance to a bank account without having to wait for the transaction to be processed.



Apple says that beginning August 26, 2021, the cost of making an Instant Transfer will change to 1.5% (previously 1%) of the transfer amount, with a minimum fee of $0.25 and a maximum fee of $15. 



If users don't want to use Instant Transfer, they can also transfer money to their bank account using ACH and receive it within one to three business days with no fee. 



To make an Instant Transfer, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Cash card, then tap the three-dotted icon. Tap Transfer to Bank, enter an amount, and select Instant Transfer.



Currently only available in the United States, Apple Cash can be used to make and receive payments in Messages, or you can get Siri to send money to a friend or family member. 


How to Set up an Apple Cash Card on iPhone and iPad


When someone sends you money, it goes on your virtual Apple Cash card, which is stored securely in the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can use the money on it to send to someone, make purchases using ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ in stores, within apps, and on the web.

CNN head Jeff Zucker said that the network has fired three
employees for going into the office without being vaccinated
against Covid-19, and that parent WarnerMedia may ultimately
require proof of the shots. […]
“In the past week, we have been made aware of three employees who
were coming to the office unvaccinated,” Zucker wrote in an email
to staff. “All three have been terminated. Let me be clear — we
have a zero-tolerance policy on this. You need to be vaccinated to
come to the office. And you need to be vaccinated to work in the
field, with other employees, regardless of whether you enter an
office or not. Period. We expect that in the weeks ahead, showing
proof of vaccination may become a formal part of the WarnerMedia
Passcard process. Regardless, our expectations remain in place.”

They follow T-Mobile in the midst of a troubled time for Blizzard
 The Overwatch League faces further turmoil, according to a new report. Coca-Cola and State Farm are re-considering their partnerships with the League in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the state of California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of widespread sexual harassment and discrimination.
As reported by the Washington Post, two of the Overwatch League’s major sponsors are “re-assessing” their relationship with the League. State Farm and Coca Cola are two of the League’s seven sponsors listed on their website, along with IBM, Xfinity, Cheez-It, Pringles, and TeamSpeak.
Brand deals are one of the ways to measure success for a competitive ecosystem like the Overwatch League. The League lost T-Mobile as a sponsor on Tuesday, and it appears as though others may soon follow.
In a statement to the Post, a representative of State Farm said that the insurance provider was “reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League” and the company has requested that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.” A spokesperson for Coca-Cola shared a similar sentiment, saying that the company is “aware of the allegations” and are working to “take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.”
J. Allen Brack, the head of Blizzard Entertainment, stepped down from his position on Tuesday, with Jen ONeal and Mike Ybarra taking his place as co-leaders. Jesse Meschuk, SVP and senior people officer at Activision-Blizzard, also reportedly left the company this week. Activision-Blizzard employees have been organizing in the face of the company’s response to the lawsuit, including 2,600 signatures on an open letter from past and present employees, and a staged a walkout at Blizzard’s California office and online.
Polygon has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment and will update this post should we receive new information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 will see the introduction of a new method for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on iPhones and iPads in the United States. 





User devices will download an unreadable database of known CSAM image hashes and will do an on-device comparison to the user's own photos, flagging them for known CSAM material before they're uploaded to iCloud Photos. Apple says that this is a highly accurate method for detecting CSAM and protecting children.



CSAM image scanning is not an optional feature and it happens automatically, but Apple has confirmed to MacRumors that it cannot detect known CSAM images if the ‌iCloud Photos‌ feature is turned off.

Prior to when Apple detailed its plans, news of the CSAM initiative leaked, and security researchers have already begun expressing concerns about how Apple's new image scanning protocol could be used in the future, as noted by Financial Times.

Here’s everything coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War in season 5
 Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War’s fifth season is almost among us, and it’s coming with a new roadmap so players can plan ahead. The roadmap features a wide variety of content like a new Gulag for Warzone, new maps and modes for multiplayer, new weapons, and a host of updates for Zombies.
The star of season 5 looks to be the new Double Agent mode, which gives off serious Among Us vibes. Players will need to complete their various tasks while the secretly selected, titular double agents will need to sabotage the match. The investigator player will need to put the clues together to help the rest of the operatives survive.

Multiplayer also sees the return of the Demolition game mode. Season 5 will feature five maps as part of its multiplayer update, including some players have seen before: Echelon, Slums, Showroom, Drive-In, and Zoo. 
Warzone will get some new features as well. Players can play the new Clash game mode, which features Quad squads battling it out deathmatch-style. New points of interest, including Broadcast Stations, will appear around the map as well, and the Gulag is getting a makeover. Warzone will also see two new perks with Tempered and Combat Scout.
The Zombies mode will see a major update with season 5. Players will get their hands on a grapple gun, a tank, and a new region called Collateral. Players can also check out a new game mode called Transport. The update includes a new perk, Death Perception, and a new field upgrade called Tesla Storm.
Finally, season 5 will add five new weapons: the EM2 assault rifle, the TEC-9 SMG, a new handgun called the Marshall, a cane, and a new scorestreak that comes in the shape of a flamethrower. As always, season 5 will add a variety of operators, a new battle pass, and a mid-season event. 
Season 5 starts Aug. 12.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[File this under Things I Definitely Want to Do Sometime: riding electric-assist railbikes through a California redwood forest. Check out how fun this looks:

From the LA Times:
To pedal the rails at Fort Bragg, you book a trip, show up at the station, settle into a vehicle, don a helmet and seat belt, pedal through four downtown intersections (train signals halt traffic) and pass a cemetery.
Then suddenly you’re in the woods, hearing only birdsong and the gentle hum of wheels on tracks. There’s no need to exert yourself pedaling: The railbikes, which weigh about 250 pounds each, are outfitted like e-bikes with quiet electric motors that can push you along at 10 mph even if you don’t pedal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced a new Apple Music for Artists feature called Shareable Milestones, which is designed to allow ‌Apple Music‌ artists to share key milestones and successes with their fans on social media.





The ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists feature generates automatic milestones for artists of all sizes, which artists can highlight on social media networks. Milestones include new highs and all-time bests across Plays and Shazams, and inclusion in ‌Apple Music‌'s curated playlists.



Artists will see images celebrating their milestones on their iOS overview page for ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists, and can tap the share icon to open up the share sheet. Users will also see relevant milestones on the song and country detail pages. Milestones can be shared to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook and Instagram stories.



Sharing milestones is a feature that's limited to artists at the current time and the images can only be accessed through the ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists iOS app.



Though limited to ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists at the current time, this is perhaps a feature that Apple could roll out to all ‌Apple Music‌ users in the future, allowing them to share metrics that are normally only available through the year-end Apple Music Replay and Recap features.



Apple Music for Artists is available to all artists who use ‌Apple Music‌. It provides artists and their teams with sales and streaming data for songs, albums, playlists, and more.

Double Agent will let you help your friends or betray them
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is getting an additional game mode for its new season. The mode is called Double Agent and it’s based on some Among Us-style deception, as shown in the trailer released on Thursday. 
Double Agent will feature 10 players, who are each assigned a random role. The most important players are the double agents, who are tasked with either eliminating their fellow players or planting and detonating bombs across the map. Most players will play as Operatives, who have to discover the double agents and keep themselves alive. Finally, there’s the Investigator, who will get special clues to help them determine the double agents and can put out Wanted Orders on players they suspect have betrayed their allies. 
The mode will feature a variety of extra features, including weapons that players can collect throughout the early stages of a match, and certain extra tools for the double agents, to help give them a leg up on their targets. The mode will also heavily use voice chat to help players identify who among them seems the most suspicious. 
Double Agent will be part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s season 5 update, which is set to be released on Aug. 12.]]></summary>

Golf through a literal bitcoin mine 
 If you thought watching Jeff Bezos thanking Amazon workers for making his edge-of-space trip possible was grim, wait until you hear the premise for the upcoming game Golf Club: Wasteland.
Developed by Demagog Studio, Golf Club: Wasteland takes players on an odyssey through a future where humans have been wiped off the face of the Earth, and the planet has become a golf course for the ultra-rich. 
In it, you’ll play as a rich person who now lives on Mars but has returned to Earth for a round of golf. The 2D side-scroller has you putting and driving through various scenes like abandoned factories and what looks to be a literal bitcoin mine. As you go through Golf Club: Wasteland, “You’ll piece together the fall of humanity at the hands of consumerism, Silicon Valley culture, and ecological disaster,” according to the game’s description. 
The main character does it all while wearing an orange spacesuit that protects them from the elements, since, y’know, after ecological collapse, Earth is no longer habitable to humans. 
Overall, the entire premise seems like a nightmare scenario for the majority of us, but hey! Could make for a fun game. Originally scheduled to launch in August, Golf Club: Wasteland is now coming on Sept. 3 to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Juliette Kayyem, assistant secretary for homeland security under President Obama, writing for The Atlantic:
The White House has rejected a nationwide vaccine mandate—a sweeping suggestion that the Biden administration could not easily enact if it wanted to—but a no-fly list for unvaccinated adults is an obvious step that the federal government should take. It will help limit the risk of transmission at destinations where unvaccinated people travel—and, by setting norms that restrict certain privileges to vaccinated people, will also help raise the stagnant vaccination rates that are keeping both the economy and society from fully recovering.
Flying is not a right, and the case for restricting it to vaccinated people is straightforward: The federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety. And although air-filtration systems and mask requirements make transmission of the coronavirus unlikely during any given passenger flight, infected people can spread it when they leave the airport and take off their mask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has published three new support documents with further details about the Mac Pro's new AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series MPX graphics modules, which became available earlier this week. The support documents walk through the many different display setups that can be used with the GPUs and how to use AMD's Infinity Fabric Link technology for increased performance and faster data transfer between the modules.





One notable detail from the support documents is that the Infinity Fabric Link bridges for the new Radeon Pro W6000 series modules are not compatible with previous-generation Radeon Pro MPX modules, according to Apple.
Use the Radeon Pro W6800X MPX Module with your Mac Pro


Use the Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module with your Mac Pro


Use the Radeon Pro W6900X MPX Module with your Mac Pro
Three new modules are available for the latest Mac Pro as built-to-order upgrade options on Apple's online store, including the Radeon Pro W6800X, Radeon Pro W6800X Duo, and Radeon Pro W6900X. The modules can also be purchased on a standalone basis for customers who already own the latest Mac Pro, with prices ranging from $2,800 to $6,000.



Apple said the new graphics options provide up to 84% faster performance when running the Octane X rendering app and up to 23% faster performance when using the video editing and color correction app DaVinci Resolve on the Mac Pro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has featured a number of apps with disproportionately expensive subscriptions on the App Store, arousing the ire of some developers.





The ‌App Store‌ feature on the Australian ‌App Store‌, first highlighted by Beau Nouvelle on Twitter, is called "Slime relaxations" and reportedly features apps that are non-functional and seek to charge disproportionately costly in-app purchase subscriptions.




Apple promoting these slime apps again.
A few of them have $10+ weekly subscriptions.
One of them doesn’t even do anything.https://t.co/d0dKLCkiVF
— Beau Nouvelle (@BeauNouvelle) August 4, 2021
 




One of the apps, called "Jelly: Slime Simulator, ASMR," features a $13 per week subscription to get past its paywall, amounting to $676 per year. Apple's App Store Review Guidelines state (with emphasis our own):
If we can't understand how your app works or your in-app purchases aren't immediately obvious, it will delay your review and may trigger a rejection. And while pricing is up to you, we won't distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs. We'll reject expensive apps that try to cheat users with irrationally high prices.




The fact that such apps have passed the ‌App Store‌ review process to be awarded a special feature from Apple on the ‌App Store‌ has induced outrage in some developers, such as Simeon Saëns of Two Lives Left, who took a closer look at one of the apps.



Given that at least some of these apps charge $13 per week, it is difficult to not see them as breaking ‌App Store‌ guidelines, so it is particularly surprising that they were actively featured by Apple on the ‌App Store‌.

In subsequent tweets, Musk revealed that Isaacson had been shadowing him "for several days so far," and said he thought all the author's biographies were good, but he "particularly liked" Isaacson's biography of Benjamin Franklin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple TV+ today released a "first look" featurette of "Mr. Corman," a dark comedy series created by, directed by, and starring Joseph Gordon Levitt.






"Mr. Corman" follows the days and nights of Josh Corman (played by Gordon-Levitt), an artist at heart but not by trade. A career in music hasn't panned out, and he teaches fifth grade at a public school in the San Fernando Valley. His ex-fiancé Megan has moved out, and his high school buddy Victor has moved in. He knows he has a lot to be thankful for, but finds himself struggling with anxiety, loneliness, and self-confidence issues.



The three-minute featurette sees the cast and crew discuss the show, and includes behind-the-scenes footage offering viewers a sense of Gordon-Levitt's creative production process.



"Darkly funny, oddly beautiful and deeply heartfelt, this relatable dramedy speaks for our contemporary generation of 30-somethings: rich with good intentions, poor with student loans, and yearning to become real grown-ups sometime before they die," said Apple, in a press release for the upcoming show.



The first two episodes of the 10-episode first season will debut on August 6, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IMDb has released standalone iPhone and iPad apps for its free, ad-supported TV streaming service, meaning users looking to access its video offerings no longer need go searching for it in the standard IMDb app.





IMDb TV offers viewers free access to a range of popular shows and movies, such as "Mad Men," "Malcolm in the Middle," "Wolf of Wall Street," and "How to Train Your Dragon." It also features originals from Amazon Studios, and the company says IMDb TV has half as many ads as traditional terrestrial TV.



The Amazon-owned subsidiary originally launched the free service as Freedive in January 2019, before renaming it IMDb TV. After first rolling out to Roku, IMDb TV apps were released in March for LG smart TVs, PlayStation 4, NVIDIA Shield, and TiVo Streak 4K. The IMDb TV app is also available on Amazon's Fire TV and as a free channel on the Prime Video app. 



The launch of iOS and Android apps completes the platform rollout, and should allow the service to expand its U.S. mobile audience. A report last year suggested the company is planning to make the free service available globally, with Mexico and the U.K. possibly becoming the first regions to gain access, with more European countries and Latin America following suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week began highlighting exclusive offers that are available for Apple Card holders, with the offerings presented right in the Wallet app when accessing the ‌Apple Card‌.





As noted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is offering ‌Apple Card‌ users free access to Apple News+ and unlimited coffee with any order from Panera bread.




Looks like Apple is planning some sort of “Offers” feature for the Apple Card. I just saw a free News+ offer (sponsored by Panera Bread) in my Wallet app on iOS 15 on two devices. Link to sign up is broken and the message is now gone: https://t.co/zb8EVfTYBY
— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) August 5, 2021
 


This feature is still in the process of rolling out, and tapping on the "Learn More" button leads to a broken link so the full terms of the ‌Apple News‌+ deal are unknown.



Apple has offered special promotions for ‌Apple Card‌ users before, usually in the form of extra cash back from select merchants or discounted prices on digital goods.



Extra cash back deals are also shown right in the ‌Apple Card‌ interface like the ‌Apple News‌+ offer, but this appears to be the first time that Apple has advertised one of its own services to ‌Apple Card‌ holders directly in the Wallet app.



It's not unusual for credit card companies to offer discounts and deals to their customers on various products, but Apple is in the unique position of having credit card customers and services to promote to its credit card users.

 Fullbright co-founder Steve Gaynor, known for his work on Gone Home and Tacoma, has stepped down from his role as creative lead on Open Roads following multiple allegations of mistreating Fullbright employees, particularly women.
Development on Open Roads, which was announced in December 2020 and expected to star Keri Russell (The Americans) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart), is behind schedule. Fifteen employees have left the studio since development on Open Roads began in 2019; around six staff members remain.

Assistant game director Joe Blackburn revealed a Trials of Osiris revamp and the potential return of Rift
 Destiny 2’s PvP community has been up in arms for months. Between rampant cheating in the pinnacle Trials of Osiris game mode and their frustration at a lack of new maps, players focused on the Crucible have felt ignored for quite some time. But ahead of Bungie’s Destiny 2 showcase on Aug. 24 — which will show off season 15 and next year’s Witch Queen expansion — assistant game director Joe Blackburn took to Twitter to announce some planned PvP improvements. 
First, Blackburn revealed that Trials of Osiris is getting a revamp in season 15, which starts later this month. He didn’t go into detail on what this revamp will improve, but promised players will get more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple in July began providing developers with access to a beta version of the AirPods Pro firmware to test new features ahead of their release. Last Friday, Apple released a second version of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware (4A362b), but it went under the radar until today when it was shared on Reddit.





According to Apple's developer website, the second ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware update adds support for Conversation Boost, a feature that was missing from the first beta.



Conversation Boost is an iOS 15 feature that uses the beamforming microphones in the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to boost the volume level of conversations, which is ideal for those with mild to moderate hearing challenges.



The initial ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware beta added support for FaceTime Spatial Audio and Ambient Noise Reduction, two other ‌AirPods Pro‌ features that are coming in the ‌iOS 15‌ update.



Only registered developers are able to install the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware, and the installation process is rather complicated and requires Xcode. We have a walkthrough on installing the profile for the beta, but as with all over-the-air firmware updates, it takes some time for new software to be seeded to users.

Free update for PC players; launching Aug. 12 on Switch and Xbox Game Pass, too
 Art of Rally, the gorgeous, chill, and, most importantly, fun racing game that launched on PC last fall, will join the Xbox Game Pass library on Aug. 12, and launch for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on the same day.
That’s not all; developer Funselektor has a new content update planned for the game the same day, taking racers to Kenya, the game’s sixth locale (joining Finland, Norway, Japan, Germany, and the Italian island of Sardinia). This update will roll out free to those who already own Art of Rally on PC, and be included in the new console versions at their launch on Aug. 12.
Funselektor said back in May that it expects a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5 release this summer also, but it does not yet have a launch date to share.
The Kenya Update adds four new cars, two new songs, six more stages with locations referencing Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, a free-roaming map set in the Kenya environment, and even local wildlife. Zebras, giraffes, and elephants will highlight the wide-open savanna.
Art of Rally launched Sept. 23, 2020 on Windows PC and MacOs via Steam. It’s a semi-top down (mostly isometric, though the camera can be changed) approach to rally/road racing, and Funselektor has created an homage to the great FIA competition groups of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including the gloriously reckless Group B of 1982 to 1987. Art of Rally’s cars are all fictitious, but they’re very well done homages to the recognizable chassis of their times. (My favorite is the German-engineered Das Whip.)]]></summary>

"Argylle" is based on the upcoming spy novel of the same name from author Ellie Conway. It follows the world's greatest spy in a globe-trotting adventure, and shooting is set to start later this year.



The upcoming film has a star-studded cast, with Henry Cavill set to star. It will also feature singer Dua Lipa along with John Cena, Bryce Dallas Howard, Samuel L. Jackson, Sam Rockwell, Catherine O'Hara, and Bryan Cranston.



Matthew Vaughn is known for directing films that include "Kingsman," "Kick-Ass," and "Stardust." In a statement, he said he was thrilled to work with Apple.

I'm thrilled to team with Apple and bring the most compelling spy thriller I've ever read to the only streaming service that can create a franchise of this scale and quality for global audiences to experience.


Apple has been working to secure the rights to multiple high-profile films to attract customers to Apple TV+. The company has also inked deals for "Killers of the Flower Moon" with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, "Emancipation" with Will Smith, "Bride" with Scarlet Johansson, "Snow Blind" with Jake Gyllenhaal, "Sharper" with Julianne Moore, and "Kitbag" with Joaquin Phoenix.

But practically, how big is the biggest, heaviest black hole in the universe? (A: More massive than the entire Milky Way.)
The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like planets or stars they have no physical size limit, and can literally grow endlessly. Although in reality specific things need to happen to create different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single things in the universe. So how do black holes grow and how large is the largest of them all?


Videos about space are where Kurzgesagt really shines. I’ve seen all their videos about black holes and related objects, and I always pick up something I never knew whenever a new one comes out. This time around, it was quasistars and the surprisingly small mass of supermassive black holes located at galactic centers compared to the galaxies themselves.

World colonization will be pushed back to a later date
 Amazon Game Studios has delayed its upcoming MMO, New World, to fall 2021. The game was previously scheduled to launch at the end of August, but the new release date is Sept. 28, 2021. 
This is the most recent of multiple delays for the game. “We know that this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer,” the developers said. “But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.” The team cited feedback from the closed beta as a factor in pushing back the game. 
You can read the full statement on New World’s Twitter page here.

— New World (@playnewworld) August 4, 2021



The aforementioned delays started in April, where the studio cited problems created by the coronavirus lockdowns. In July 2020, the studio announced that the game would be delayed to spring 2021. Then, in February 2021, the studio delayed it once more to August, 2021. The original target date was May, 2020. 
New World is an MMO where you’re tasked with colonizing a fictional landmass in the Atlantic. The game features 50-on-50 fights where entire groups clash to take the land. Amazon previously hosted a preview event with thousands of players to gather feedback. Then, it became a chaotic attempt to simulate mid-1600s war. 
New World is one of three PC games announced by Amazon Game Studios at TwitchCon 2016. However, delays and cancellations have impacted all three titles. Their multiplayer brawler Breakaway was canceled during development. Their other title, Crucible launched in May 2020, only for the studio to un-release the game and bring it back into a closed beta. The team later ceased development of Crucible in October.]]></summary>

In a review of Angie Schmitt’s 2020 book Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America for the New York Review of Books, Peter Baker explores why America is increasingly hostile to pedestrians. Part of the reason is the rise of SUVs (and one would assume, trucks) in the US:
In the 1980s SUVs were a rarity. It was only in 2015 that they started outselling sedans. In 2018 they accounted for just under half of new vehicle sales, more than any other category of car.…]]></summary>

"Come From Away" tells the story of several thousand people who have been stranded in Gander, Newfoundland after flights into the United States were grounded after the attacks that took place on September 11, 2001.
"Come From Away" tells the story of 7,000 people stranded in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland after all flights into the US are grounded on September 11, 2001. As the people of Newfoundland graciously welcome the "come from aways" into their community in the aftermath, the passengers and locals alike process what's happened while finding love, laughter and new hope in the unlikely and lasting bonds that they forge.
Directed by Christopher Ashley, who directed the original Broadway production, "Come From Away" has an ensemble cast led by members of the Broadway show.



Apple says the live performance of "Come From Away" was filmed in May at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in New York City for an audience of 9/11 survivors and front-line workers.

Automatic song ID has been a dream for decades, but analyzing sound has always been extremely difficult. The breakthrough came when researchers, including Merlin lead researcher Grant Van Horn, began treating the sounds as images and applying new and powerful image classification algorithms like the ones that power Merlin’s Photo ID feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook has fallen to eighth place on a list of the highest-paid CEOs and executives in the United States last year despite earning more than the previous year, according to Bloomberg.





Cook was paid $265 million in 2020, mainly comprising stock awards and a bonus as in previous years, making him the eighth highest-paid executive in the United States. Last year, Cook was paid compensation of $133.7 million, but ranked second after Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was paid $595.3 million.



Cook has overseen Apple's rise to become the most profitable company in the world this year with revenue of $274.515 billion and profit of $57.411 billion, according to the Fortune Global 500 rankings.



In 2020, Cook was surpassed in terms of pay by the COO of Oak Street Health, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, the CEO of Opendoor Technologies, and the Co-CEOs of GoodRX Holdings. Elon Musk again overwhelmingly topped the list with compensation amounting to $6.658 billion.



Last month, it was alleged that Musk demanded to become the CEO of Apple as part of early discussions around a potential Apple acquisition of Tesla, though Musk denies this.



Apple's Senior Vice President of Retail and People Deirdre O'Brien and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams also made the list in 93rd and 96th place, with pay of $45 million each. This makes O'Brien and Adams the fourth and fifth-highest paid women executives in the United States.

Since 2017, Amazon has been the dominant company in the smart speaker market, with over two-thirds of smart speakers in U.S. homes being Amazon devices. Google holds about a one-quarter share of smart speaker devices, while Apple and Facebook have the small remaining share.



Josh Lowitz, CIRP partner and co-founder, said that while the installed base of smart speakers added over 25 million units over the past year, reaching a total of 126 million units, Apple still "failed to make meaningful inroads."

The 45th fighter for SF5 may be a peek at SF6
 Capcom revealed Street Fighter 5’s final character, the roster’s 45th fighter, on Tuesday: It’s Luke, a brand-new fighter “that specializes in moving fast and hitting hard.” More importantly, Luke’s reveal was pitched by Capcom as a peek at the future of the Street Fighter series, so don’t be surprised when he shows up as a central character in Street Fighter 6.
Gameplay featuring Luke delivering a savage beatdown of Ryu was released on Tuesday, but we don’t know much about Luke’s background or his full move set. Capcom promises to reveal more details about Luke before his release in November.
Two other fighters are coming to Street Fighter 5 sooner: Oro from Street Fighter 3 and Akira Kazama from Capcom’s Rival Schools series will be released as paid DLC on Aug. 16. You can get an in-depth look at those new DLC fighters in Capcom’s Street Fighter 5 summer update video below.


Those three DLC characters are included in Street Fighter 5’s season 5 pass, and each one can be purchased separately for MSRP $5.99 or 100,000 Fight Money, SF5’s earnable in-game currency.
Luke “will help expand the world of Street Fighter and provide fans with a glimpse into the future,” Capcom teased in a news release. That’s likely a reference to the next Street Fighter, which is reportedly due sometime in 2022, based on details leaked from a ransomware attack on Capcom in 2020. That leak outed references to Street Fighter 6 arriving in the third quarter of 2022, followed by Super Street Fighter 6 and Ultra Street Fighter 6 in the years following. Capcom has not officially announced any of those projects, and plans may have changed since then.
The latest version of Capcom’s flagship fighting game series, Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.]]></summary>

Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania arrives Oct. 5 
 Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, the latest entry in Sega’s white-knuckle banana-grabbing platform game series, will include a variety of cameos, including Beat from the Jet Set Radio franchise.
Sega said Wednesday that Beat is just one of “several iconic guest characters” coming to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, and teased more reveals in the weeks to come. Beat is the cover star of the original Jet Set Radio and its sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, the stylish inline skating/graffiti games released for Sega Dreamcast and the original Xbox.
Jet Set Radio’s Beat will be a free, unlockable character, obtained through normal gameplay on all platforms, Sega said in a news release. In a nice little touch, when playing as Beat, the in-game bananas will change to yellow cans of spray paint.
Beat joins a familiar list of simians returning in Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania: AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, YanYan, and Doctor. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a modern, high-definition remake of the original three Super Monkey Ball games. It’s coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X on Oct. 5. The console versions will costs $39.99, while the PC version costs $29.99.]]></summary>

Most bands these days, though, hover somewhere between the points, calling themselves crossover, thrash, USDM, beatdown, metalcore, d-beat, or any other of the infinite permutations of the metal-punk marriage.

Meanwhile, Android maker Oppo continues to publicize new iterations of its under-screen camera technology, which it has yet to feature in a shipped phone. 




Prototype device featuring Oppo's USC


Oppo unveiled its first go at under-screen camera tech back in June 2019, and this is its third attempt at refining the system. According to the Chinese phone maker, the new version allows for a selfie camera to be placed under the display "without compromising the integrity of the screen."



In previous iterations, Oppo improved the camera quality at the expense of the display, by reducing the pixel density in the area of the screen that covers the camera…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of a class action lawsuit settlement, Zoom says it will pay $85 million to users for misleading them about offering end-to-end encryption on its videoconferencing service.





According to ArsTechnica, the company was accused of lying about its encryption description on its website and in a security white paper, as well as providing user data to Facebook and Google without users' permission.



Filed at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the proposed settlement will give Zoom users around $15 or $25 each, depending on whether they had a free or paid subscription between March 30, 2016 and July 30, 2021. Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.



In addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, "designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data," according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.



In April 2020, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by The Intercept revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.



TLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. 



For Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys. But that level of security was not what the service offered at the time.

Apple is set to produce between 90 million and 95 million iPhones through January, according to a previous Nikkei report, and China's Luxshare Precision Industry has won 3% of orders away from Taiwanese rivals Foxconn and Pegatron.

Luxshare will start building the iPhone 13 Pro -- as the premium model is expected to be called -- this month, according to sources, a major breakthrough for a company that has never produced iPhones on its own. Newcomers to the Apple supply chain normally start out making older iPhone models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[T-Mobile is planning to shut down Sprint's LTE network on June 30, 2022, T-Mobile confirmed to Light Reading. The shuttering of Sprint's LTE network is part of an effort to merge the two networks following T-Mobile's purchase of Sprint.





T-Mobile is building a 5G network that uses Sprint spectrum and towers, and it is aiming to shift Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network instead of the Sprint network.



In addition to shutting down the Sprint LTE network, T-Mobile plans to deactivate Sprint's 3G CDMA network on January 1, 2022.
To ensure all customers can enjoy a more advanced 4G and 5G network, we will be retiring older network technologies to free up resources and spectrum that will help us strengthen our entire network, move all customers to more advanced technologies and bridge the Digital Divide. An additional part of this effort involves moving Sprint's LTE spectrum to the T-Mobile network.
At the current time, T-Mobile has transitioned approximately 33 percent of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network. Before Sprint's LTE network is shuttered, customers will need to transition to T-Mobile by replacing their Sprint SIMs with a T-Mobile SIM and ensuring that Voice over LTE is enabled in the device settings for voice calls on applicable devices.



T-Mobile says that most Sprint LTE and 5G devices are compatible with T-Mobile's LTE and 5G networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a short downtime, Apple has updated its Apple.com website to add a dedicated "Store" section, which has a new look.





There's a new "Store" tab in the top navigation bar on the website, which goes to a dedicated online store portal where customers can select from a product carousel with cards that include Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and more. 



The design is similar to the design of the Apple Store app, and the main store page also features current deals and promotions, along with accessories and products that Apple is highlighting. Navigation is done through horizontal scrolling, which feels more natural on iOS devices than on the desktop.





Clicking into a product category like Mac presents all of the different options, along with access to comparisons and shopping specialists, accessories, and other information. 





Choosing to "Buy" a product through the store interface goes to the standard purchase pages that can also be accessed through any of the standard Mac, ‌iPad‌, ‌iPhone‌, or Watch categories.  



The Apple online store previously had a store tab, but it was removed in an earlier redesign. The return of the tab will make it easier for customers to get to the product they want to purchase without having to navigate through the various product pages for each device to find the "Buy" button.

The two will join Chun-Li and Ryu in the battle royale 
 Fortnite is getting two more characters from Street Fighter. Guile and Cammy are coming to Fortnite as unique outfits that players can buy from the in-game store, Epic Games announced Tuesday.
Guile will come with his signature costume as well as an alternate outfit that puts him in a black tank top and shorts. He’ll also get an emote and K.O. back bling. Meanwhile, Cammy comes with her classic costume and an alternate called Tactical Cammy. Cammy will also have a Borealis Backer back bling, and an emote. Buying the bundle with both characters will also unlock a loading screen with them teaming up for a fight, as well as some harvesting tools, and a jet glider.


This is the second Street Fighter duo to make their way to Epic’s battle royale game after Chun-Li and Ryu were released earlier this year. The new skins come after Epic released a teaser earlier on Tuesday, which featured a variety of Street Fighter characters on a character-select screen. The characters were on a giant map of the world with the Fortnite boss appearing to cross from the United States to the U.S.S.R., though apparently that didn’t matter much since Cammy is from the United Kingdom. 
Both skins will be released on Aug. 7, and will be available in the Fortnite in-game item shop.]]></summary>

Given that it's a Tuesday night/afternoon in the United States and we're not expecting any new products this week, it's likely that this is a temporary maintenance outage that is not related to a new product release. The Apple Store app is also down at the current time. 



We'll update this article when the online Apple Store is back up and functional, and we'll let MacRumors readers know if there are any notable changes. 



Update: The online Apple Store is back up. Apple has re-added a "Store" tab to its main site, but that appears to be the only change, suggesting the outage was mostly a behind-the-scenes maintenance update.

Priced at $40, the Mobile Gaming Clip attaches to an Xbox controller using a fitted clip and holds an iPhone with the magnetic mount.

The magnetic mount offers "strong magnetic alignment and attachment" to keep the ‌iPhone‌ in place during gameplay.



The clip is able to detach from the base to serve as a table top stand, and when not in use, it folds flat for easier storage and transportation.



The Mobile Gaming Clip for MagSafe can be purchased from the OtterBox website for $39.95. It is compatible with the Xbox Series X/S Controller, the Xbox One Controller, and the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Fraser, known for movies like "The Mummy," "Encino Man," and "No Sudden Move," has signed up to take on a role in Martin Scorsese's upcoming film "Killers of the Flower Moon," reports Deadline.





Set in 1920s Oklahoma, "Killers of the Flower Moon" depicts the serial murder of members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation in a string of brutal crimes known as the Reign of Terror.



The film is set to star Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, and more, with a full list of the cast available on the Apple TV+ press page for the movie. Fraser will play lawyer W.S. Hamilton, a character in the book the movie is based on.



There is no set release date for "Flowers of the Killer Moon" at this time, but production began in February 2021 and is set to last for several months. The movie is being filmed in the Osage and Washington counties in Oklahoma.



"Killers of the Flower Moon" will be one of the most high-profile films available on Apple TV+ when it launches, and it will join existing movies like "Greyhound" with Tom Hanks, "Cherry" with Tom Holland, and "Palmer" with Justin Timberlake.



Apple is working on a slew of movies to boost the content available on its streaming television platform. Upcoming movies include "Emancipation" with Will Smith, "Bride" with Scarlet Johansson, "Snow Blind" with Jake Gyllenhaal, and "Sharper" with Julianne Moore.



‌Apple TV+‌ is priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple offers a 7-day free trial for everyone and a longer three month trial period for those who purchase a new Apple device. There are also various promotions for free ‌Apple TV+‌ access. Sony, for example, offers a six month Apple TV+ trial for those who have purchased a PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today previewed two new games that will be released exclusively on its subscription-based gaming service Apple Arcade.



Listed as coming soon in Apple Arcade, the new titles include "MasterChef: Let's Cook" from Tilting Point and "Layton's Mystery Journey+" from Level-5. No specific release dates have been announced for either game at this time.





"MasterChef: Let's Cook" is an all-new game that will challenge players to prepare and serve food dishes in a fast-paced cooking competition inspired by the world-renowned TV show. Players will attempt to showcase their cooking abilities to become the number one chef as they are matched with other players around the world, according to Apple.



The game will also be updated with weekly in-app events based on specific themes and seasons such as Gourmet Burger Show and Spooky Show.





"Layton's Mystery Journey" is an existing game on the App Store that is now becoming available to Apple Arcade subscribers. Players will join Katrielle Layton in the heart of London as she becomes embroiled in a quizzical quest to search for her missing father, Professor Hershel Layton. Kat's bicycle-based journey will have players experiencing London's famous landmarks, from the Houses of Parliament to Tower Bridge.



Nickelodeon's "SpongeBob: Patty Pursuit" has also received an update on Apple Arcade with a new competitive daily mode inside of Plankton's Chum Bucket lab.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

The trailer also shows off some potential new additions for season 5
 Stitch’s plan is almost complete in the new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s newest season. We know that Stitch is working to achieve Perseus’ goal of a Great Russia, and after he destroyed the military base on Yamantau, it seems the next step in his convoluted plan involves a mind-control broadcast. Along with the new trailer, Treyarch also announced on Tuesday that season 5 will begin on Aug. 12. 
The new trailer features a few teases of the season to come, including a likely new Operator wearing an eye patch and uploading Stitch’s broadcast signal. The signal finishes uploading just as a squad of soldiers, led by Woods, arrives to stop the mysterious new character. But they’re moments too late, and the broadcast signal turns the soldiers against each other and Woods, starting a massive brawl.
During the chaos of the fight, it’s possible to pick out a few potential new weapons for the season, including TEC-9s, which seem like a perfect new pistol, and possibly a new rifle. On top of that, it’s even possible that this new broadcast signal could be teasing some kind of mind-control Killstreak, but we’ll have to wait for more information to find out. 
With season 5 on the way soon, Treyarch and Raven Software will probably tease new features over the next several days before everything is revealed early next week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:
Tensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.
Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.
Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone.
“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google really means it this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today began offering new high-end AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series graphics options for brand new Mac Pro configurations, and now the graphics modules are available for purchase on a standalone basis for customers who already own the computer.





Three new MPX modules are available for the latest Mac Pro, including the Radeon Pro W6800X for $2,800, the Radeon Pro W6800X Duo for $5,000, and the Radeon Pro W6900X for $6,000. Apple says customers can install up to two of the modules in a Mac Pro using Infinity Fabric Link technology for enhanced multi-GPU performance in applications like Final Cut Pro.



Announced in June, AMD said the Radeon Pro W6800 graphics module delivers up to 79% faster graphics performance than the previous-generation Radeon Pro W5700, although this was based on a test system powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X processor rather than an Intel processor. The W6800 also features 32GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory.



The current Intel-based Mac Pro was released in December 2019 in both tower and rack versions. Apple is reportedly working on a new Mac Pro powered by an Apple silicon chip with up to 32 high-performance cores and up to 128-core graphics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was 16 years old on the day the Berlin Wall fell. I remember coming home from school that day and watching the events unfold on television, completely shocked at how quickly it had all happened. Politics & protests had been pushing the Eastern Bloc countries toward more openness for years, but before watching this video, I’d never heard that the catalyst for that world-changing event was a short mistaken statement at the end of an otherwise boring press conference. From the BBC:
East German leaders had tried to calm mounting protests by loosening the borders, making travel easier for East Germans. They had not intended to open the border up completely.
The changes were meant to be fairly minor — but the way they were delivered had major consequences.
Notes about the new rules were handed to a spokesman, Günter Schabowski — who had no time to read them before his regular press conference. When he read the note aloud for the first time, reporters were stunned.
“Private travel outside the country can now be applied for without prerequisites,” he said. Surprised journalists clamoured for more details.
Shuffling through his notes, Mr Schabowski said that as far as he was aware, it was effective immediately.
In fact it had been planned to start the next day, with details on applying for a visa.
But the news was all over television — and East Germans flocked to the border in huge numbers.


How did the Berlin Wall fall? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.

Apple says that once the changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps for developers will be updated. Developers can change the price of apps and in-app purchases in ‌App Store‌ Connect at any time.

Steal a diamond and shake down saloons
 Red Dead Online’s Blood Money update is still fresh, but Rockstar is adding a few more missions for cowboys to explore. Blood Money introduced a new mission type called Opportunities, and a new one of these is on the way.
Players will get to chase down a precious yellow diamond, called Il Sovrano, which is currently in Rhodes. A group of “monied elite are meeting,” which makes this an excellent opportunity for a robbery. It’s up to you whether you go in nice and sneaky-like, or just pull out a shotgun and do things dirty. This Opportunity can be repeated on higher difficulties; completing it on Ruthless difficulty allows you to purchase a Duplessis Top Hat from Collector guide Madam Nazar.
There are also three new missions under a Saloons Contract. These require players to go to the local bars in Saint Denis and politely request some money. These missions can be acquired from open world contacts, and sometimes they can go peacefully, but other times cowboys might need to apply a little bit of violence.
Finally, a new game mode will launch on Aug. 10 called Call to Arms, in which players protect local townsfolk by fighting off waves of enemies. It will launch alongside a smaller season pass, the Quick Draw Pass, which grants players rewards as they level up.]]></summary>

New game from Soda Drinker Pro creator
 First, there was the ultimate soda drinking experience, Soda Drinker Pro. Now, creator Will Brierly has a new concept: Beach volleyball, but with naked old men. It’s Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League, created in collaboration with illustrator Rachel Olson and Aaron Bleyaert, the host of Conan O’Brien’s Clueless Gamer series.
Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is, essentially, what is says on the tin. You’ll play as Len, an older gentleman enrolled in a nude beach volleyball league specifically for older gentlemen. The game is, largely speaking, volleyball, played with a nude ref who sometimes makes bad calls. There’s a story underneath it all, though, told through dialogue that continues throughout the game. 
Brierly said he hopes it makes players want to hug their grandparents or anyone else they love. At the very least, the game has a very catchy song.
Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is available Tuesday as a bonus game in Humble Choice, the monthly games service from Humble Bundle. Humble Choice gives subscribers 12 PC games every month for $9. On Friday, it’ll be added to Humble Trove — the library of games available to Humble Choice subscribers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the new App Store features coming in iOS 15 is something called ‌App Store‌ events, which will see Apple highlighting timely events within apps and games.





Apple is now experimenting with ‌App Store‌ events on ‌iOS 15‌ devices, and in the Today view of the ‌App Store‌ on iPhone, users can now see a notice about a TikTok Summer Camp event that's set to take place today. The event is also being shown on iPadOS 15, as noted by 9to5Mac.



Listed as a card in the Today view, the first ‌App Store‌ event has a label with the time that it takes place and a link to download TikTok, which is the app that has the event going on. Tapping into it provides more information on just what the event is, and in this case, it is a Summer Camp session where creators and artists can share their expertise with fans.



According to Apple, ‌App Store‌ events will be used to tell customers about game competitions, new movie premieres, livestreams, and more. Events will be shown in the Today view, but can also be found in the Games and Apps tabs, in search results, and on the app product page.





‌App Store‌ events are limited to ‌iOS 15‌ devices, so the TikTok Summer Camp event does not show up on devices running iOS 14.7.1. Events will pick up as the launch of ‌iOS 15‌ approaches, and everyone will have access when ‌iOS 15‌ sees a public release.



Other new app-related features in ‌iOS 15‌ include an ‌App Store‌ widget that lets you see stories, collections, and events in the Today View or the Home Screen, and a privacy-focused feature that tells you which apps have accessed your location, camera, microphone, and contacts during the last seven days.

Master Chief? You mind telling me what you’re doing on Waze?
 Driving a car is OK, I guess, but it’s not a very “gamer” activity. Thankfully, Google’s navigation app Waze has a newly announced feature that will allow drivers to activate a Halo theme. Drivers can pick between either the Banished War Chief Escharum or my boy Master Chief, who will offer gruff navigation guidance and color commentary. 
This limited-time feature promotes the upcoming Halo Infinite, which is currently planned for a holiday 2021 release on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Not only will the tones of Master Chief or Escharum guide you along roads, but drivers can also change their in-app car icon to a Warthog or Ghost, and apply one of the two characters to their profile. You can also have Master Chief update you in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese.
You can hear a sample of Waze’s new Halo-themed content, including a warning about heavy traffic from Escharum, over at Xbox Wire.
Master Chief is one of the icons of the Xbox, which means he’s a common choice for cross promotion. He also reared his head in Sea of Thieves as a ship figurehead in the Spartan set,  and showed up in Fortnite.]]></summary>

Improved grip, trigger surfaces help you hang on through heavy action
 A new Xbox Wireless Controller is now available for pre-order, and it will ship on Aug. 31. The Aqua Shift Special Edition features a pearlescent blue color scheme, as well as an improved grip texture that wraps the controller’s triggers, bumper buttons, and back casing.
The launch model controller for the Xbox Series X has corrugated surfaces on the same parts, but they are part of the plastic casing. Microsoft’s announcement on Tuesday emphasized that the Aqua Shift’s grips are an additional, rubberized component, the first time a standard Xbox Wireless Controller has gotten this treatment.
“Aqua Shift is the first Special Edition Xbox Series X|S controller to feature rubberized side grips with a unique dual color swirl on every unit,” the statement said. “Textured grip on the triggers, bumpers, and back case makes sure you stay connected to the game no matter how intense things get.”
The controller is $69.99, $10 more than the MSRP for a standard Xbox Wireless Controller. It’s compatible with the Xbox One, as well as Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices, all of which can now stream games from the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate library.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared the trailer for the second season of anthology drama series "Truth Be Told," starring Octavia Spencer and Kate Hudson. The first episode premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday, August 20, with additional episodes to follow every Friday.






"Truth Be Told" descends into the world of true crime podcasts. In season two, Spencer reprises her role as podcaster Poppy Parnell as she dives into a new case that involves her childhood friend, media mogul Micah Keith, played by Hudson. As developments unfold in the case, their lifelong friendship is put to the ultimate test.



Based on the novel by Kathleen Barber, Apple says "Truth Be Told" provides a "unique glimpse into America's obsession with true crime podcasts" and "challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage."



Apple TV+ is Apple's subscription-based service for original TV shows and films, with pricing set at $4.99 per month after a seven-day free trial or a lengthier trial with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple device. Apple TV+ is available through the Apple TV app on devices like the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, newer PlayStation and Xbox consoles, select streaming players from Roku, Amazon, and Google, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of the MagSafe Mount Stand, a new MagSafe charging accessory that's designed to integrate with Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ Charger.





Like Nomad's prior MagSafe Mount accessory, the ‌MagSafe‌ Stand is a holder for the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger rather than a standalone charging option. It is an upright stand with a cutout for the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and a space to route the cord behind it.



The ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand is made from a dark gray aluminum material, and it is heavy enough to keep the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger well secured on a desk. An iPhone 12 used with the ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand can be oriented upright in either portrait or landscape mode, and the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger is held in place with microsuction.





Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ Charger is able to charge the ‌iPhone 12‌ models at 15W (though the iPhone 12 mini is limited to 12W) so long as the proper 20W+ power adapter is supplied. You will need to supply your own ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and power adapter with the ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand.



The ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand can be purchased from the Nomad website for $59.95.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google today announced new updates that are coming to the Google Maps app designed for the iPhone. The most notable new feature is dark mode, which Google Maps app users have long been wanting. Dark mode is an alternative to light mode and allows for a darker user interface to match other dark mode apps on iOS devices.





According to Google, dark mode is going to be rolling out "in the coming weeks," and once available to you, it can be enabled in the Settings section of Google Maps. Google says that dark mode in Google Maps will save battery and "give eyes a break."



Apple first introduced the Dark Mode feature with iOS 13, but it has taken Google some time to bring support to its apps. Google earlier this year began rolling out a true dark mode feature to Android users, and the iOS version of dark mode for Google Maps looks similar to the Android version.



Along with dark mode, Google today announced the launch of new Messages integration. With this feature, Google Maps users can share their real-time location with friends in an iMessage using the Google Maps button in the Messages app. Location is shared for one hour by default, but there is an option to extend access by up to three days or stop access at any time.





Google's blog post also highlights the recently introduced widgets feature, which allows ‌iPhone‌ users to add a Google Maps widget to the Home Screen or the Today View. Widgets can be used to check traffic conditions or find nearby places.





The Google Maps app can be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link]

Following the announcement that all Delta flight attendants would receive an iPhone 12 in April, the airline has now said that all pilots will be given an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ as part of their pilot electronic flight bags (EFB).



The ‌iPad Pro‌ will be used for a range of pre-flight management tasks and processes, where flight data and aircraft load information will be delivered directly to each pilot's EFB, which use custom-built apps. 5G connectivity, supplied by AT&T, will also be essential to how pilots use the device.



iPad Pro is extremely versatile in aviation, with its thin and light design, and bright, immersive display. The powerful new iPad Pro with 5G features the breakthrough Apple-designed M1 chip for a massive leap in performance, an all-new 12MP Ultra-Wide front camera, and advanced Liquid Retina display technologies with ultralow reflectivity for an unmatched viewing experience on the ground and in the air.




Delta follows JetBlue, which started rolling out the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ to pilots last month, but the airline has been equipping its staff with iPhones and iPads since it dropped Windows devices in 2017.

Viego? More like, Vieg-NO
 Riot Games has introduced a new event to the world of Runeterra, where the Ruined King Viego scours the world of League of Legends in search of his dead wife’s soul. To send him and his undead army back, an ancient order called the Sentinels of Light rise up. The group’s leaders, Senna and Lucian, gather up an unlikely band of champions to fight back.
That storyline culminated Tuesday in a new cinematic called Absolution. In Absolution, the Sentinels finally rock up on Viego’s doorstep to put his dastardly campaign to an end. Viego and his servants face off against the Sentinels, new champion Akshan uses his special death-undoing weapon to save the day, and Viego is chained in his kingdom of Camavor. It’s a neat ending to an ambitious event.
Players can still log into Wild Rift and the PC League of Legends client to see visual novel-style stories that expand on the events of the cinematic, the Sentinels and their relationships with one another, and the deep lore of characters, like upcoming champion Vex.]]></summary>

Mobile student IDs in the Wallet app will also be expanding to Canada this year, starting with the University of New Brunswick and Sheridan College.



"We're excited to work with more schools in the US and introduce mobile student IDs in Canada to provide a secure and convenient way to get around campus with iPhone and Apple Watch," said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay. "Students and faculty have embraced using their iPhone and Apple Watch as the best way to access buildings, purchase meals, and more."



Many colleges and universities already support student IDs in the Wallet app in the United States. At participating institutions, students can simply hold their ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch near a reader anywhere physical student ID cards are accepted — on and off campus. An optional Express Mode bypasses the need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, allowing for the quickest entry possible to buildings.

Run over zombies and zombie cows in Bugbear’s new update
 The spirit of classic, violent racing game series Carmageddon is coming to Wreckfest, Bugbear Entertainment’s demolition derby-themed racing game. A new update adds a new car, two new tracks, and streets filled with zombies (and zombie cows) to plow through. Wreckfest’s latest tournament borrows its visuals from the original Carmageddon, a pixelated mess by modern standards, which gives it a sense of charm.
Wreckfest players will be able to race through two vintage Carmageddon tracks (Bleak City and Death Canyon) and ride in the sawblade-adorned Eagle R car, which appeared in 2016’s Carmageddon: Max Damage.
The action is certainly less sadistic than the original Carmageddon, which awarded players bonus points for running over innocent pedestrians. Wreckfest’s version of vehicular homicide is more about cleaning up the streets of undead, with palatable splashes of green, pixelated blood splashing across the screen.
Wreckfest is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. We called its brand of destruction-filled racing some of the most fun we had in 2019. The Carmageddon series kicked off in 1997, with Stainless Games’ original game for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows PC. The developer followed that game with a series of sequels, including Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now, Carmageddon TDR 2000, and Carmageddon: Reincarnation.]]></summary>

The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled "Electronic devices with adjustable display windows" and was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It explains how a device's display could move as to show and hide the front-facing camera and other optical components.



Apple describes this mechanism as creating a "window region" in the display, through which a camera or other TrueDepth array components, such as a dot projector for Face ID, can work. Then, when these parts are not in use, the display would move back over the window region to hide the sensors underneath it. The summary of the patent reads:

The social network — started a month ago by members of former President Donald Trump’s inner circle — features reams of jihadi-related material, including graphic videos of beheadings, viral memes that promote violence against the West and even memes of a militant executing Trump in an orange jumpsuit similar to those used in Guantanamo Bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s the thing about humans: they will danceify every possible activity — and canoeing is no exception.
American Freestyle canoeing is the art of paddling a canoe on flat water with perfect control of its movements. The canoe is usually leaned over to the side to help the boat turn sharply and efficiently and paddle strokes are taken on either side of the canoe depending on the individual move. Balance, paddle placement and turn initiation are a few keys to this control. Since the movements seem dance-like, some practice this art timed to music, which is the ultimate in control.


The vest & bow tie, the choice of music (The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh), his control of the canoe — it’s all perfect.

*Anyhoo, the oft-overlooked former captain of the Flyers, Jason Smith, is BACK with the organization! You love to see it. Guys always come back. [LV Phantoms]
*Speaking of former Flyers, are you worried about how Carsen Twarynski is feeling out in Seattle? No? Me neither but Sam wrong an article about it anyway. [Inquirer]
*We gave Chuck’s offseason moves thus far some grades. All very fair. Wide range. Lots of opinions. [BSH]
*Meltzer takes stock of the team’s veteran presence, which is pretty sizeable at this point. [Flyers]
*Have you been thinking about placing a bet on the Flyers for next season? Well the odds are, as is the Flyers’ way, right about middle of the pack. [The Athletic]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For his video series for Eater, Daniel Geneen took a tour of the Lodge Cast Iron factory in South Pittsburg, Tennessee to see how cast iron skillets are made.
While all of this is happening, molds for pans are being made out of fine, pliable sand that’s compressed in massive machines. The ladles pour the molten metal into these molds. Once the metal is poured and cooled, the sand molds get placed into a shake-out machine that shakes the sand away from the pan, and then into an enormous drum to shake off the rest. The pans are finally put on a giant conveyor belt to be sorted and inspected. Any pans that are not up to muster get thrown back into the original scrap heap to be melted down again and remade into another pan.


In comparison, here’s how Borough Furnace makes their cast iron pans by hand in their much smaller workshop:

Very similar process, down to the sand molds, just on a much smaller and more hands-on scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reese Witherspoon's media company "Hello Sunshine" recently courted various buyers, and while Apple was one of parties interested in buying Hello Sunshine, the Cupertino company did not end up going through with the purchase.





Hello Sunshine was valued at around $900 million thanks to its involvement in popular series like The Morning Show," "Big Little Lies," and "Little Fires Everywhere," and it would have marked Apple's largest media purchase to date had a deal been established.



Instead, Hello Sunshine is being purchased by an upcoming media venture run by two former Disney executives backed by Blackstone Group. According to The Wall Street Journal, the purchase was made as part of a plan to build an independent entertainment company.



There is no word on how much was paid for Hello Sunshine, but Reese Witherspoon and current CEO Sarah Harden will join the board of the new company and will continue to operate it.



Though Apple did not purchase Hello Sunshine, the two companies will continue to work together. Hello Sunshine is responsible for "The Morning Show" and it is involved in multiple upcoming Apple TV+ projects including "Surface" starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, "The Last Thing He Told Me" with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series "My Kind of Country."



Recent rumors have suggested that Apple is exploring other purchase opportunities and has expressed interest in film studio A24. A24 has developed hit movies like "Hereditary," "Moonlight," "Lady Bird," and "Midsommar," plus it already has a content deal with Apple.



A24 and Apple have partnered on "Mr. Corman" and "On the Rocks" along with and upcoming films "Sharper," "The Sky is Everywhere," "The Tragedy of Macbeth," "Bride," and more.

Tony Moretti’s the man to know around Los Santos
 Living in Los Santos isn’t easy, especially when you’re an average civilian. In your average game of Grand Theft Auto Online, the world runs on Looney Tunes logic — people are running through the streets on flying motorcycles and calling orbital strikes down upon their enemies. 
On the game’s unofficial role-play servers, however, things are calmer, and there’s room for individual characters to thrive. Take, for example, a character named Tony Moretti, a former mafioso and made man who runs his own, very elaborate cab company business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple must face a patent infringement lawsuit over the heart rate technology in the Apple Watch, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled today.





Back in 2018, Apple was sued by Omni MedSci, with the company alleging that Apple used its patented technology in the Apple Watch. Apple reportedly met with Omni MedSci between 2014 to 2016 to discuss a possible partnership, but Apple is said to have ended discussions and used technology from four Omni patents anyway.



According to Reuters, Apple attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed.



Omni MedSci is owned by Mohammed Islam, who has been described as a "poster child for a patenting professional." He owns six companies and has collected more than 150 patents. In the past, he has used those patents to sue companies that include Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia, and Siemens.



Islam is employed by the University of Michigan, and Apple's argument for dismissal was that his patents were owned by the university, which the University of Michigan supported on behalf of Apple. The appeals court decided that was not the case, and that Islam's employment agreement did not automatically assign his patents to the university.



Omni MedSci has claimed that Apple willfully infringed on its patents. The company is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of the Apple Watch, along with damages. Omni MedSci's attorney told Reuters that the company is "pleased by not surprised" by the ruling.

Fight Rainbow doppelgangers in three-week Containment event
 Rainbow Six Siege is getting a new, limited-time event, and it’s a tie-in for the series’ next game, Rainbow Six Extraction.
Containment, as the PvP event is called, begins Aug. 3 and runs until Aug. 24. Monday’s announcement said Containment is “inspired by the upcoming game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction,” which was re-titled from Rainbow Six Quarantine during an E3 2021 reveal in June.
Containment will take place on a reworked version of the Consulate map. In-game, the building is overrun by the Chimera parasite, whose outbreak forms the narrative context of Extraction. It was also the basis of Operation Chimera, an expansion for Siege that launched in 2018, which introduced a cooperative event called Outbreak.
Containment’s new playlist is called Nest Destruction. Players will get a look at REACT, the faction that will be doing most of the cleanup in Extraction. In Nest Destruction, the Attackers are REACT agents (a news release in July said Rainbow operators Ash, Mira, and Thermite formed this squad). The Defenders are alien shapeshifters who look like REACT teammates, but can only use melee attacks. Attackers are there to destroy the nest, Defenders are there to destroy the Attackers.
Containment will offer 33 unique items, including uniforms and weapon skins, for operators IQ, Ace, Blackbeard, Amaru, Zero, Aruni, Jager, Kaid, Mira, and Warden. These items are available in Siege’s shop for 1680 R6 credits, or in Containment Packs that run 300 R6 credits or 12,500 renown.
Rainbow Six Extraction was originally expected to launch Sept. 16, but in mid-July, Ubisoft announced it was postponing that release until January 2022. Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions on Amazon Luna and Google Stadia.]]></summary>

Downloading the Twitter app presents an option to "Continue with Apple," which is available alongside the "Continue with Google" or "Create Account" options.




Sign on with ease and start scrolling your timeline. 
Now, when you log in or sign up to join the conversation on Twitter, you have the option to use:
▪️ Your Google Account on the app and on web
▪️ Or your Apple ID on iOS, and soon on web pic.twitter.com/Nf56H1ghmY
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) August 2, 2021
 


Using Sign in With Apple, Twitter users who wish to create a new account can do so with their Apple IDs, and can elect to hide their true email addresses from Twitter. Signing up is as simple as confirming an account with Face ID, though Twitter users will still need to provide a date of birth and other info.



Account names appear to be generated based on user name and can be changed afterward, but there are some limitations to be aware of. Since Sign in with Apple does not create a password, it can be difficult to change an account's email address, select a new profile name, or deactivate an account.



Twitter says that ‌Sign in with Apple‌ support will be coming soon to the web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple's Maps app benefits from a range of new features and improvements, including the ability to use augmented reality walking directions in big cities.





In a nod to Google Maps, the new AR mode can map walking directions onto the real world by using your iPhone's rear camera, making it easier to see where you need to go in built-up areas and reducing the need to look down at your smartphone as you move.



First, initiate a walking route, then simply raise your ‌iPhone‌ and scan the buildings around you when prompted. The step-by-step directions will appear in the AR mode automatically, which should make it easier to get where you need to go, especially in situations where the directions are tricky.





The AR feature is available from late 2021 in major supported cities including London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadephia, San Diego, San Francisco and Washington DC.



Note that to get augmented reality walking directions, your ‌iPhone‌ will need an A12 chip or later. The A12 was first used in the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ XS, XS Max, and XR, which came out in 2018, which means that iPhones released after 2018 are compatible with the AR feature.

Risking injury and incarceration, an environmental activist disrupts the clear-cutting of an ancient redwood grove by sitting on a tiny platform a hundred feet up in the tree canopy. Already three years into the tree-sit when filming begins, AMONG GIANTS blends vérité cinematography with intimate personal reflection to create a vivid picture of life in the trees and the unwavering dedication of the activists.


The activists’ tree-sit was successful — 1000 acres of the redwood forest were transferred to a public trust to create the McKay Community Forest. (via the morning news)

Welcome to Emergence
 It’s once again time for a new Apex Legends season. While Respawn Entertainment has already teased the season’s new features over the past few weeks, we didn’t get the actual patch notes until Monday, and they show plenty of balance changes to switch things up.
Several Legends got changes in this patch, including Caustic, Horizon, and Fuse, along with some quality-of-life tweaks given to Revenant. Caustic’s adjustments mostly deal with making his gas canisters a little stronger, dealing more damage and giving them a slightly shorter cooldown. 
The other Legend with big changes in season 10 is Fuse, whose Knuckle Cluster Tactical explosion now lasts twice as long. Fuse’s Ultimate ability also now reveals enemies tra…]]></summary>

343 Industries version of a firing range makes trying new weapons extremely easy
 Picking up a weapon in Halo isn’t always as simple as point and shoot. While it’s not the  Ratchet & Clank series, Halo is known for unconventional weapons like the Spartan Laser or the long-standing needler. With all the weapons spawning around the map and not in the player’s hands, it can create a bit of a learning curve. But Halo Infinite’s new weapon drills solve that problem.
Over the last weekend, I spent several hours checking out Halo Infinite in its first technical test. When I loaded up the preview on Friday, the first thing I did was drop into the game’s weapon drills to see the new and changed weapons. 
These weapon drills allow me to go into the armory and pi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before this morning, I had never heard of Lusia Harris and now she’s one of my favorite basketball players. Playing in the 1970s, before the enforcement of Title IX in athletics, the 6’3” Harris dominated in high school, led a small university to three consecutive national basketball championships in the first 5 years of the program (while averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds per game), scored the first basket in Olympics women’s basketball history, is the only woman ever officially drafted by an NBA team, and was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. And those aren’t even her proudest achievements — you’ll have to watch the video for that.
For an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals — but Harris’s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot’s “The Queen of Basketball,” Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.


This video is part of the NY Times’ Almost Famous series, which also includes stories about radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell and actress/singer Kim Hill.

To truly understand Wi-Fi 6E, MacRumors sat down for an exclusive interview with Kevin Robinson, senior vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, to discuss the new generation of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi's relationship with 5G, and what new experiences it will enable. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a group few have probably heard of, but as Kevin describes it, it's a crucial part of the Wi-Fi puzzle, consisting of a "who's who" in the connectivity space.

Eric Baptizat left Ubisoft in 2020 after 16 years
 Eric Baptizat, game director on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and many other Ubisoft projects, is the current game director for EA Motive’s recently announced Dead Space remake. Baptizat left Ubisoft after 16 years in 2020 and joined EA to work on an unannounced title. He’s since confirmed via his LinkedIn page that he’s helming the new Dead Space title, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.
While Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was Baptizat’s first gig as game director, he served as lead game designer on several other games, namely Assassin’s Creed Origins, Assassin’s Creed Unity, and Assassin’s Creed Black Flag. 
The Dead Space remake is both a remaster and spiritual successor to the original game. The game will still take place on the USG Ishimura, the mining starship from the original, but will have “an improved story, characters, gameplay mechanics, and more.” The remake was rumored to be in development for months prior to its announcement at EA Play 2021. 
EA Motive has yet to offer a release window for the Dead Space remake, but said the game will eventually come to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

Taking a look at the moves made by one of the busiest teams in the league.
 As the lights dimmed on the 2020-21 season, sights were set on what was expected to be an extremely active Summer for the Flyers. In short, it’s arrived. Chuck Fletcher, who recently sat down with us for a one-on-one interview, made it known that he won’t hesitate to make big changes to the roster when needed. But change isn’t inherently good, it has to be the right change. So, how do we feel about the trades that he’s made?
IN: Ryan Ellis
OUT: Phil Myers, Nolan Patrick
Brad: I think that Myers still has a very good chance to become an above-average top-four defender in Nashville, but last season certainly opened up the idea of him being a classic “all the tools” …]]></summary>

When the CDC changed its guidance on masking earlier this week — recommending, among other things, that even vaccinated people start wearing masks in indoor public spaces in areas of substantial to high Covid transmission — it cited “unpublished data” as a reason for its decision. The next day, the internal CDC document that seems to have prompted the shift was published — by the Washington Post. And when major news media got a look at, the message they sent vaccinated people was pretty simple: “Panic!”
This reaction was not justified by the actual data in the CDC document.
Headlines matter, and the headlines for these stories have been grossly misleading.

The AppleDesign Keyboard is a cheap cost-cutting imitation of the Extended Keyboard. It doesn’t even have an embedded Apple logo, just its silhouette punched into the mold of plastic. The symbolism that Apple was only a shadow of its former self in the mid-90s could not be any clearer.
I rate it 2⁄5 stars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTube is piloting a new cheaper subscription tier in Europe called "Premium Lite," which offers ad-free viewing minus YouTube Premium's other features.





First spotted by a user on ResetEra and subsequently confirmed by Google, the "Lite" plan means users who aren't interested in offline downloads or background playback can still enjoy YouTube videos on web and mobile app without being interrupted by ads. 



A YouTube spokesperson told The Verge: 

"In Nordics and Benelux (except for Iceland), we're testing a new offering to give users even more choice: Premium Lite costs €6.99/month (or local equivalent per month) and it includes ad-free videos on YouTube." 
A standard YouTube Premium plan costs around €11.99/£11.99 a month in Europe and $11.99 in the United States, and includes ad-free viewing on web, mobile app, smart TVs and consoles, as well as ad-free YouTube Music listening, background playback, and offline downloads.



As The Verge notes, the "Lite" option costs around 60% of the price of a Premium plan but only offers a quarter of the features. However, YouTube says that the subscription plan is still in an experimental phase, and that it could still roll out more plans to gauge user feedback.

The details appeared Sunday in a tweeted photo, since deleted, by EVP and GM of Intel's Client Computing Group, Gregory Bryant, who was documenting his visit to Intel's R&D labs in Israel.



As outlined by AnandTech, the photo from a Thunderbolt-related tour revealed a poster on a lab wall with the words "80G PHY Technology," suggesting TB5 connectivity will support up to 80 Gb/s throughput, or double the bandwidth of existing Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 connections.

Specifically, Apple plans to "significantly increase the adoption" of IPDs or integrated passive devices for the peripheral chips in its products. These news chips will be slimmer in size and allow for higher performance while also taking up less internal space inside a device, allowing for larger batteries.

Apple is expected to significantly increase the adoption of IPD (integrated passive devices) for new iPhones and other iOS products, providing robust business opportunities for manufacturing partners TSMC and Amkor, according to industry sources.

Image credit: Tap Down Under 


As spotted by Tap Down Under, users who have received two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine now have access to the digital certificate through their Medicare online account or via the Medicare app, downloadable as a PDF or by using the "Add to Apple Wallet" option.



The front of the digital certificate includes the user's date of birth, document number, and the "valid from" date, which indicates the date the second dose was received. The back of the pass includes the individual's Healthcare Identifier, what vaccine was received, and the date of both doses.



The Australian digital certificate is official proof of COVID-19 vaccination should it become needed domestically or for travel, and is separate from any other immunizations the individual may have received. The certificate is similar to digital passes generated by some other government apps, such as the UK's NHS COVID pass scheme.

 Ariana Grande is the next performer to get a massive Fortnite in-game concert. The popstar will be featured in-game as part of the Rift Tour event in August, Epic Games announced on Sunday with a short teaser video on Twitter. 
The Rift Tour event will be a massive in-game musical spectacular and will add several cosmetic items to the game, including an official Ariana Grande Icon series outfit to the shop — if certain leaks are correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shawn King, writing for The Loop:
But I remember having my spidey senses tingle last year with these
awards so I did some digging into it. The first thing I noticed
was you have to “pay to play” — that is, it costs $5.50 to submit
a single image with “discounts” given for multiple image
submissions. Paying to submit images to a contest is not
necessarily a bad thing but it always raises concerns for me.
Next up was the judges — or lack thereof. In an interview
with Input, the founder of the IPPAWARDS Kenan Aktulun
(whose Twitter account is protected) wouldn’t say who the
judges were:
I asked Aktulun to share some details behind the curtains about
the judging process. Though he wouldn’t say specifically who the
panel of judges was for the 2020 winners, he said they were made
up of a diverse cast of visual storytellers including
photographers and designers.
That’s always a red flag for me. Every reputable photo completion,
from Apple on down, lists the names of the people doing the
judging.
The prizes are sort of shitty too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the "Apple Watch Edition" collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple's retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.





Noted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his "Power On" newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn't stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.

Apple hasn't said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here's my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn't sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. 



We'll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn't surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what's the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? 
As Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of "Apple Watch Edition" models with ceramic and gold. Apple may also decide to end the titanium Apple Watch models later this fall.

Arc System Works’ long-running fighting game has opened up
 Guilty Gear is one of the longest-running legacy fighting game series out there. Since the first installment in 1998, it’s been held in high regard by fighting game diehards. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean much to the average gamer looking for a new fighting game to play. To attract new players, Guilty Gear needs to learn from other fighting games and change up its formula, something it’s done with great success in the latest entry, Guilty Gear Strive.


There are a set few fight game series that are able to crack that casual consciousness. Games like Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Super Smash Bros., and even Virtua Fighter are among the few that you may be…]]></summary>

“I think I had the same reservations that many people had,” Bob, who requested that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, tells Rolling Stone.
Then Bob saw a tweet from Goddess Alexandra Snow, a professional dominatrix and dungeon owner who operates Wicked Eden, a BDSM collective based in Columbus, Ohio. The tweet stated that any submissives who wanted to session with Snow in person would have to show proof of vaccination. Bob had been subscribing to Goddess Snow’s OnlyFans and “tributing” her (giving her money) for almost two years, and he got in touch with her to discuss whether or not he should get the vaccine. “It was less about convincing me and more about her confirming to me that it was the right thing to do,” he says. He got his final shot three weeks ago. “It [feels] good to know that I’m (hopefully) contributing to others not falling seriously ill,” he says. “And of course, it’s gratifying to know I’ve done something that Goddess Snow approves of.”

Our Guardian is facing a never-before-seen challenge: local politics
 Since 2017, Destiny 2 players have had to contend with a game that by and large still silos off the most colorful aspects of its fiction in dense lore books; story moments are relegated to dialogue in the comms channel, the explosive defeat of Big Enemies, and the cameo appearance of NPC models who by and large just stand there, deliver exposition, then transmat out of the game space before we move on to the next weekly space wizard chore.
This is a problem that’s obviously on the minds of Destiny 2’s creators.
In Luke Smith’s 2019 blog post at Bungie.net, “Director’s Cut — Part III,” the Destiny 2 director lays out his vision for an “evolving” game world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telegram Messenger has received a major update to its video capabilities, including support for video calls with up to 1,000 viewers. 





Group video calls in Telegram allow up to 30 users to stream video from both their camera and their screen, and now a maximum of 1,000 people can tune into the broadcast. Telegram says it intends to continue increasing this limit "until all humans on Earth can join one group call."



Meanwhile, video messages now have a higher resolution, and any audio playing on the user's device will keep playing when a message is being captured so that it's included in the recording. 



In addition, users can now tap on a video message to expand it in the conversation thread. Tapping on an expanded video message initially pauses it, and it's also possible to fast-forward and rewind the message.



Elsewhere in this update, the media player now supports multiple video playback speeds, screen sharing has been added to one-on-one calls, the in-app camera supports all zoom levels a device is capable of, and the media editor includes new tools to illustrate photos and videos with drawings, text, and stickers.



Several other smaller tweaks and improvements have made it into this bumper update, and Telegram has further details in its latest blog post. Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

This guide covers everything that Apple added to the ‌Find My‌ app in ‌iOS 15‌.



Live Locations


When you track a friend or a family member using the ‌Find My‌ app, it now shows continuous streaming updates on their location rather than updating with a new location every few minutes.



Apple says that this feature is designed to provide an immediate sense of speed, direction, and progress when you're looking at someone's location.

The show aims to find "unicorn" companies, which are startups able to reach a $1 billion valuation. A panel of investors called the "Circle of Money" serve as judges on the show, in a format that's similar to "Shark Tank." Circle of Money members include Steve Wozniak, Lance Bass, Moe Vela, Silvina Moschini, Alex Konanykhin, Scott Livingston, and Rosa Rios.
Unicorn is the name given to startup companies with a valuation of over one billion dollars. If you spot one and invest in it at an early stage, you could potentially earn enormous returns on your investment.

Get two weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Wormhaven
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, Warlock helmet)
5 wins — Sola’s Scar, Solar sword
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock arms)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter today to criticize Apple's App Store fees in a tweet that sides with Epic in the ongoing Epic v. Apple dispute.





"Epic is right," wrote Musk, before going on to call Apple's ‌App Store‌ fees a "de facto global tax on the Internet."



Musk earlier this week made veiled comments about ‌App Store‌ fees, but today's statement is a much more direct criticism.



During Tesla's earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was planning to let other companies use its charger network because Tesla does not want to "create a walled garden" and use that to "bludgeon" competitors. Musk said that this is a tactic used by "some companies," and then he fake coughed and said "Apple."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the iPad has long been the world's most popular tablet, newly published market research helps put Apple's lead into perspective.



According to estimates shared by research firm IDC, Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter of 2021. By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.





A big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.





iPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.



The launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.

The claim comes in a new book titled "Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk and the Bet of the Century," as reviewed by The Los Angeles Times.





According to the book, during a 2016 phone call between Musk and Cook that touched on the possibility of Apple purchasing Tesla, Musk told Cook that a purchase of Telsa by Apple could only go forward if he became CEO of the combined company. 
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk are talking on the phone. The 2016 unveiling of the make-it-or-break-it Model 3 is coming soon, but Tesla is in serious financial trouble. Cook has an idea: Apple buys Tesla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago, Apple announced that it would be revamping its Maps app with more detailed maps, better road coverage, and faster and more accurate navigation. The improvements have since rolled out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and Apple is focusing on Italy next.





According to Apple Maps enthusiast Justin O'Beirne, Apple recently started testing its revamped Maps experience across the Italian Peninsula, including San Marino and Vatican City. The updated maps appear to be limited to devices with the iOS 15 developer or public betas installed for now, but at WWDC 2021 last month, Apple announced that its revamped Maps experience would be expanded to all users in Italy and Australia later this year.



In early 2020, Apple said it would begin rolling out the revamped Maps experience across Europe in the coming months, so other countries should soon follow. The updated maps provide more comprehensive views of roads, buildings, parks, airports, shopping malls, sports venues like baseball fields and tennis courts, and other details.

This is part sculpture, part performance art, and may make the most complex video feedback ever created, using three cameras, two video switchers, a sheet of beam-splitter glass, and an HDMI input from a phone or live video feed.
Much like a musical instrument, the operator at the helm of this device plays it, but instead of making sounds, makes entire worlds, spirals within spirals, loops within loops, galaxies, classical fractal imagery and primordial organisms, leaves, trees, and insects. It really is the God machine.

Industry sources speaking to Nikkei Asia said that all of the processors for Apple's upcoming ‌iPhone‌ and Mac devices are produced at this facility. This presumably translates to the  iPhone 13 lineup and redesigned MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon, containing the "A15" and "M1X" or "M2" chips.



Gas used in the production of these chips was found to be contaminated on Thursday night. TSMC to…]]></summary>

 *So now that Chuck is done (ostensibly), we’ve got the long hot August between us and players on the ice. Sigh. Anyhoo, Charlie looks at the last two moves Chuck made this week: Martin Jones and Nate Thompson. [The Athletic]
*If there’s one thing we can take from Chuck’s offseason it’s that he is ready for this team to win now. This isn’t a man building for the future. [NBC Sports Philly]
*But there were some risks taken. Last summer, Chuck bet that his players would repeat their performance from the end of the regular season. He lost that bet. This year, he’s better that a couple of his new players will improve. We’ll see how it goes. [BSH]
*We spoke with Alex from The Cannon to get a little inside information about Cam Atkinson. [BSH]
*Our pal Michael Raffl has found a new home down south. [Defending Big D]
*It seemed like a Vladimir Tarasenko trade was imminent. And it still hasn’t happened. What’s up with that? [ProHockeyTalk]
*If you were worried about Ron Hextall going to the Penguins and making them into a winner again... well, he’s doing Ron Hextall things over there. We’re fine. [Pensburgh]

Apple adds UPI payments to App Store in India pic.twitter.com/idIeKbpwPP
— Ganesh (@ganeshkulkarni) July 30, 2021
 


The acceptance of RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI)  cards means Apple users in India will be able to use the domestic payment systems as alternatives to regular credit/debit card payment methods to add funds to their Apple ID balance. 



They can then use their ‌Apple ID‌ balance to buy apps, games, music, iCloud storage, and more in Apple's online stores.



RuPay was launched in India in 2012, and facilitates real-time electronic payments at all Indian banks and financial institutions. The massively popular instant payments network UPI followed in 2016.

The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia will soon require all its on-site employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as most of their patients are too young to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The hospital did not specify a deadline for employees to receive the vaccine, but said in a statement Thursday that it is “currently preparing for the implementation of a vaccine requirement.”
“We believe that it is our duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves, especially our young patients,” the statement read.

Final Fantasy 14 instantly makes new players shout ‘I need that’ at their monitor
 Starting a new MMO is one of the most daunting things a video game player can do. Games like Final Fantasy 14 have massive, sprawling worlds filled with hundreds of hours worth of quests and more systems than 10 AAA games put together. So shepherding a player through their first 10 hours and reminding them that this game is worth their time is key to a good experience. 
But nothing incentivizes a player to stick with an MMO than seeing all the cool shit you can unlock as you level up, and nothing does that quite as well as Final Fantasy 14.

On October 28, 1899, Lora Webb Nichols was at her family’s homestead, near Encampment, Wyoming, reading “Five Little Peppers Midway,” when her beau, Bert Oldman, came to the door to deliver a birthday present. The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.


You can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.

The ‘first and only expansion’ for Outer Wilds
 Mobius Digital’s time-looping adventure game Outer Wilds — Polygon’s Game of the Year for 2019, by the way — is getting an expansion. It’s called Echoes of the Eye, and it’s coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox One on Sept. 28.
Echoes of the Eye will “weave directly into the existing world and narrative” of Outer Wilds, said Mobius Digital creative director Alex Beachum. “If you played the game you might be wondering ‘How? And also why?’ And those are very good questions,” Beachum added.
Announced during publisher Annapurna Interactive’s showcase on Thursday, Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye is ... well, like the main game, maybe it’s better if you don’t know too much going into it? That seems to be the developer’s approach to Outer Wilds’ new content, but here’s the official description of what players can expect:
The hearthian space program has detected an anomaly that canʼt be attributed to any known location in the solar system. Grab your flashlight and prepare to illuminate the darkest secrets of the Outer Wilds... 

Beachum calls Echoes of the Eye the “first and only expansion” for Outer Wilds. Watch its “willfully cryptic trailer” above.
The original Outer Wilds is coming to Nintendo Switch this holiday.]]></summary>

An ode to jank
 One of my favorite games this summer is Necromunda: Hired Gun, which is a thrill ride of violence, guts, and gore in the grim darkness of the far future. The game is extremely fun, but also ... kind of sloppy. It isn’t quite broken, but it doesn’t fully work, either. 
In a word, it’s janky — and that’s part of why I love it so much. On one hand, jank breaks immersion and reminds us we’re playing a game, but on the other hand, it’s fun and often endearing. I’m not afraid to say it: I love these awkward baby horse games, and their stumbles only make them more endearing.
“Jank” is when the illusion of a world rips, and you can see the machinery underneath making the game work. Jank can manifest in silly looking animations…]]></summary>

Knock things over, claw up furniture, solve puzzles, and lick your own butt
 A new trailer for Stray, the futuristic cyberpunk adventure game in which you’ll control a cat, offers our best look yet at developer BlueTwelve Studio’s game. The cat-centric gameplay looks impressively authentic; as the titular stray cat, you’ll knock things over to solve puzzles and create new pathways, leap through a strange city with feline grace, and claw up furniture because you despise humans’ material investments.
Most of what you’ll do in Stray draws upon the real-world abilities of a cat. But you also have a helpful companion, a drone named B-12, who offers other gifts. B-12 will helpfully interact with objects in the world and communicate with the city’s robotic inhabitants. The cat will also have to avoid danger from rat-like creatures, but with the help of B-12, it appears the cat can turn the tables and kill them en masse with a purple light.
The cat can also very believably lick its butt, as seen in the GIF below.
Stray is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC sometime in early 2022.]]></summary>

Stylized action-platformer is coming to PC, PS4, and PS5
 Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine will release its next game, the 3D action-platformer Solar Ash, on Oct. 26, publisher Annapurna Interactive announced Thursday. Solar Ash is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.
Heart Machine first revealed Solar Ash in 2019 (as Solar Ash Kingdom). Players take on the role of Rei, a Voidrunner who will journey through a colorful, stylized world as she fights to save her planet from the Ultravoid. The developer promises fluid controls, with rail-grinding, grappling, and cloud surfing. 
“Solar Ash is Heart Machine’s vision of the adventure platformer,” game designer Alx Preston said of Solar Ash earlier this year. “The giant spaces, the feel of movement, the flow of combat, and the high stakes battles atop enormous beasts all come together to bring players something we think is incredibly unique, and more importantly, fun.”
In our review of the developer’s Hyper Light Drifter, we praised the top-down action game for its combination of story and gameplay: “It replaces traditional narrative structures with moods, but punctuates those contemplative, quiet moments with constant scenes of breakneck, pitch-perfect action. Getting those two elements to not only coexist but thrive together is a needle that Hyper Light Drifter confidently threads.”]]></summary>

The “Snake” in the mod is done in the style of Wind Waker, so he has big eyes and cute, stubby legs. (The little sausage legs just dangle in the wind as he parachutes down.) He wears his hair up with his recognizable headband and dons the dual-toned tactical espionage suit Snake is known for.

A difficult game with a generous ramp
 A simple screenshot of Death’s Door evokes its Dark Souls influence without you even needing to know it’s the follow-up to Acid Nerve’s previous top-down boss-killer, Titan Souls. Death’s Door captures that FromSoftware gloom in an instant, but it’s a far more forgiving experience than its inspiration.
Where Soulsborne games build seemingly impossible walls for you to break down from the start, Death’s Door carefully ramps up its difficulty to create a fair and completable experience. It’s still a challenge, but Death’s Door reduces the likelihood you’ll hit an impassable wall by slowly pushing your boundaries.
What is Death’s Door?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This video from Vox takes a look at how Taiwan avoided a Covid-19 outbreak for more than a year (and kept total deaths to just 7 in 2020 in a country of 23.6 million) while residents were mostly able to go about their normal lives. The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:
This was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.


After more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now. When the rest of the world is teeming with the virus, it becomes more likely over time that even the most organized and protected systems are going to be vulnerable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aaron E. Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:
Many may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and
distancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well
enough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did
when we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are
less likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed
by those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be
fought and ignored by those who aren’t.
Hospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because
someone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring
because too many people are not immunized.
This is why I’ve advocated vaccine mandates. I don’t understand
how we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.
Here’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:
A year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an
obviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of
2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread
of Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term
solution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the
world could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.
Now those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of
summer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a
mask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and
federal governments — should consider mandating something else
first: vaccination.
Asking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. The backlash is growing.

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. 
Update (July 29): Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics revealed that Black Panther and Marvel’s Avengers War for Wakanda expansion will launch Aug. 17.]]></summary>

Own the game? You won’t lose it.
 Forza Motorsport 7 is a relatively young game, having only been released in 2017. Today, Microsoft announced that the game is about to reach “End of Life” status, which means it’ll be unavailable to purchase on the Microsoft Store or through Xbox Game Pass after Sept. 15. Players who already own the game will be able to download and play the game as normal, including multiplayer and other online services. Microsoft will also continue to run Rivals esports events with partners.
Players who own DLC for the game but access the main game through Xbox Game Pass will not be locked out of the game either. Microsoft explains how these cases will be handled. The post reads, in part:
For any Xbox Game Pass players who previously purchased DLC for the game, but not the game itself, we have good news! You will receive a token for the game through the Xbox Message Center so that you can continue playing Forza Motorsport 7. Token distribution will be through August 2. However, if after that date you have not received your token, please contact Xbox Support here. (Unused tokens will expire on September 15, 2023.)
If you know someone who has yet to play Forza Motorsport 7, we are offering a discount on the game in the Microsoft Store through September 15.
The next game in the series, which is simply called Forza Motorsport, currently has no release date, although it will come to Xbox Game Pass on day one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released watchOS 7.6.1, a minor update to the watchOS 7 operating system that was released in September 2020. watchOS 7.6.1 comes two weeks after the release of watchOS 7.6, an update that brought ECG capabilities to new regions.





‌‌The watchOS 7.6.1 update‌‌ can be downloaded for free through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the ‌iPhone‌ by going to General > Software Update.



To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery, it needs to be placed on a charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



According to Apple's release notes, the watchOS 7.6.1 update includes important security updates and it is recommended for all users. An Apple security support document indicates that the update fixes a memory issue that may have been actively exploited in the wild, so Apple Watch users should upgrade as soon as possible. This is the same issue that Apple previously addressed in iOS 14.7.1 and macOS Big Sur 11.5.1.

The music creation app has also gained seven new Producer Packs with beats, loops, and instruments created by top producers, including Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. Another new Producer Pack provides a companion experience to the upcoming Apple TV+ docuseries "Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson," allowing users to experiment with sounds inspired by the music in the show.

"For this update, we've collaborated with an incredible group of artists and producers to give musicians an amazing collection of new sounds to play with, and we hope even more people will be inspired to tap into their creativity and start making music in GarageBand."



The new Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available today as a free download from the Sound Library in GarageBand 2.3.11, the latest version of the app for iOS and iPadOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released the trailer for the second season of its Apple TV+ original show "See," which will premiere with one episode on the platform on August 27, with new episodes following every Friday. The second season of the show will run for a total of eight episodes.






"See" was one of the first shows to premiere on ‌Apple TV+‌ in 2019 and features Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, and Alfre Woodard. The show follows the story of humanity losing the ability to see, and according to Apple, the second season will tell the story of Baba Voss, played by Jason Momoa, attempting to be reunited with his family. 

“See” is set in a brutal and primitive future, hundreds of years after humankind has lost the ability to see. In season two, Baba Voss (Momoa) is struggling to reunite his family while protecting them as the threat of war looms between the Kingdom of Paya and the Trivantian Republic. Despite his best efforts, his wife and sighted children are pulled to the forefront of the conflict, where they come to the attention of his estranged brother, Edo Voss (Bautista), a powerful and cunning Trivantian general, whose long-simmering hatred for his brother imperils them all even further.
The show's second season premiere joins a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, with the second season of the hit comedy show Ted Lasso having premiered last week, and upcoming shows, such as "The Morning Show" with their second season premiering in September.

GM Chuck Fletcher is playing a potentially dangerous game with his goaltending situation heading into 2021-22.
 After posting the NHL’s worst save percentage (.880) and allowing the most goals in the league a season ago, the Flyers are once again leaving their goaltending situation to chance in 2021-22.
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher has worked hard this offseason to try and improve his roster — adding defensemen Ryan Ellis and Rasmus Ristolainen via the trade market and dumped the offensive-minded Shayne Gostisbehere for cap space. Heck, he even swapped out a major defensive liability at forward in Jakub Voracek for the more defensively responsible Cam Atkinson. 
But while Fletcher took care of items off his offseason checklist, one of — if n…]]></summary>

Vice today highlighted that, in an extensive letter sent to a leaker based in China, Apple warned that leaks could give third-party accessory makers the wrong dimensions and details about unreleased products. It has emerged over the past month that June saw a concerted effort by Apple to curtail information coming from a range of individual leakers outside the United States using cease and desist letters.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Full disclosure: stole that headline from a Charles O’Connor tweet. Because it would appear that, at least for now, Chuck Fletcher is all done. 
Based on Fletcher's availability today, it really does sound like the Flyers are done for now. 
Next is re-upping Hart & Sanheim. After that, sounds like they'll reassess their cap, and see if they can do (or have to do) anything else. But this very well could be "pencils down."

*Anyhoo, it was a wild, wild day around the league yesterday, and while the Flyers didn’t do anything extra spicy, the did make some moves. They: 
Brought in Martin Jones to backup Carter Hart. [BSH]
Gave out another contract to... Nate Thompson. For some reason. [BSH]
Made the Keith Yandle deal we’d all heard about officially official. [Flyers]
And then added some AHL/press box depth in the form of Adam Clendening... [BSH]
... and defenseman Nick Seeler. [BSH]
*Speaking of Yandle, Charlie broke down what his impact to the team might be ahead of today’s frenzy. [The Athletic]
*Brian Elliott landed himself in Tampa Bay. Really glad he ended up in a good spot. Best of luck, BAMF. [Raw Charge]
*Around the Metro, the Hurricanes signed Tony DeAngelo. Big yikes. [Canes Country]
*The Devils signed Dougie Hamilton. Even bigger yikes, but a different kind of yikes! [All About The Jersey]
*And finally, as we said, it was a busy kick-off to free agency season. Here’s a handy rundown of every single thing that happened, in case you missed anything. [Sportsnet]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bang & Olufsen today announced Beoplay EQ, the Danish audio outfit's first true wireless headphones with adaptive active noise cancelation.





To achieve maximum noise cancelation, the buds use adaptive ANC that combines active noise cancellation with passive sealing. Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.



The Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.



The compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They're IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. 





Wireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for iPhone licenses.



Beoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang & Olufsen's website and in Bang & Olufsen retail stores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zens today announced the launch of a new 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger that's designed to work with Apple's latest iPhone 12 models.





The 4-in-1 charger offers a magnetic charging puck that is compatible with the ‌iPhone 12‌. Zens says that it is a 15W magnetic charger, but it's worth noting that third-party chargers that are not using Apple's official MagSafe solution are limited to 7.5W Qi charging speeds.



The magnetic charger can be used with an iPhone in either portrait or landscape mode, and it places the ‌iPhone‌ at an ideal angle for watching videos, FaceTiming, and more.



In addition to the magnetic charging surface for an ‌iPhone 12‌, there's also a 5W charging pad that can be used for a second ‌iPhone‌ or for the AirPods.



For the Apple Watch, there's an included (and removable) Apple Watch charging puck, and along with these three charging options, there's a built-in USB-A port for charging a fourth device. The 4-in-1 charger comes with a 30W PD power adapter.



The 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger can be purchased from the Zens website for 139.99 euros, which is right around $165. Zens offers worldwide shipping.

Will more of the squad join the game too?
 Bloodsport is coming to Fortnite. The Suicide Squad sharpshooter’s appearance in the game was announced on Wednesday by Bloodsport himself, actor Idris Elba. The Suicide Squad director James Gunn originally tweeted a video about the crossover.
In the video, we get a brief glimpse of Bloodsport wreaking havoc on the Fortnite island, taking ziplines, and firing off rocket launchers — which certainly seems to fit his vibe from the trailers. According to Elba, Bloodsport is coming to the island soon; the video ends with a tease saying that we’ll get more information about The Suicide Squad’s tie-in with Fortnite sometime on Thursday. 
Oh yeah. #Fortnite fans prepare to get some dubs. @FortniteGame @idriselba pic.twitter.com/rlNQP0tk1l

This isn’t the first time that DC Comics heroes have made their way to the island. Batman and his rogues’ gallery have shown up in the past, along with a few other DC heroes and villains. Hopefully this new Suicide Squad event will include a few more of the upcoming movie’s characters as well. 
This story will be updated when Epic and Warner Bros. reveal more about the collaboration on Thursday. The Suicide Squad will be released in theaters and on HBO Max on Aug. 6.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Square Enix
    

  
It’s a start
 Fans don’t like the teeny, tiny font in the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, but that’s not stopping them from fixing it.
On Wednesday Square Enix released the Pixel Remasters of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 2, and Final Fantasy 3 on Android, iOS, and Windows PC. The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.
It started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. 
Some held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. 
As it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.
Polygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Available in the Item Store on Thursday
 The 1963 Aston Martin DB5 — the most recognizable of all the James Bond cars — crosses over to Rocket League beginning July 29.
Thanks to a deal with MGM (and, one assumes, the carmaker, too), players can get the star of 1964’s Goldfinger for 1,100 Credits from the Item Store on Thursday. Psyonix said in a news release that more of James Bond’s vehicle fleet will be made available later this year. This is all presumably a tie-in with No Time to Die, the latest Bond flick, which was originally due to premiere in 2020 but was delayed repeatedly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film, Daniel Craig’s last as Bond, will be released Sept. 30.
In Rocket League, the Aston Martin DB5 uses the Octane hitbox. It does not come equipped with pop-out machine guns, a rotating license plate, a rear-window bullet shield, or an ejection seat. But it does have a rocket boost, and it drives around with the real DB5’s signature engine note.
The car is part of a bundle that includes 007’s Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, although they can only be equipped on this car. Buyers also get the Reel Life Decal.
Rocket League last crossed over with Hollywood in June with a three-car Fast & Furious bundle, each of which also offered a Reel Life Decal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customers who visit U.S. Apple Stores will once again be required to wear masks at most retail locations, reports Bloomberg.





Apple dropped its mask requirement for vaccinated customers and employees back in June, but earlier this month, Apple began requiring employees in select regions to wear masks and encouraged other employees to do so.



Now both customers and employees in areas where the COVID-19 virus is prevalent will need to wear masks when inside an Apple retail location, and this also pertains to those who are vaccinated. Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.



Apple informed employees about the change in a memo:
"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated." The company added it is making the change "out of an abundance of caution."
In addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. "Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it," reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.



Apple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using dozens of bot accounts, The Wall Street Journal did an investigation and determined that TikTok’s algorithm needs only one piece of information to determine what you want to watch: the amount of time you spend watching individual videos. Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.
As someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.

Chuck Fletcher adds a depth defenseman, formerly of the Wild.
 On what has been an incredibly busy day across the NHL, the Flyers evidently aren’t done yet. 




According to the Athletic’s Michael Russo, the Flyers are about to sign a defenseman that Chuck Fletcher will know quite a bit about. 
Per sources, #Flyers are signing physical, mobile former #mnwild and #gophers defenseman Nick Seeler.
One-year, two-way, $750K AAV, $300K minor, $350K guaranteed
— Michael Russo (@RussoHockey) July 28, 2021



Nick Seeler, 28, was drafted in 2011 by the Minnesota Wild (5th round, 131 overall). At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.
He was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. 
Seeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.]]></summary>

Chuck Fletcher adds another depth piece.
 Continuing a very busy, yet simultaneously quiet free agency for the Flyers, the Orange & Black have signed former New York Ranger Adam Clendening to a one year, two-way deal, and if the other two-way deals signed today are any indication, his NHL salary will be something in the $700-$750k range. With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.
Clendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. 
Philadelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo today announced that it is sunsetting Dr. Mario World for iOS, a game that launched just two years ago. According to Nintendo, service for Dr. Mario World is set to end on Monday, November 1.





As of today, diamonds, the game's in-app currency, are no longer available for purchase. Starting on November 1, Nintendo says an end-of-service notification will be displayed and the game will not be playable.






Players will be able to look back at their player history in "Dr. Mario World Memories," a web page that Nintendo plans to launch later this year. This website will use player history, and customers can avoid being included by deleting their save data in the app.



Dr. Mario World is a puzzle game based on the well-known Dr. Mario Nintendo title. Players are tasked with matching capsules with viruses in order to clear out all the viruses on the board, and Nintendo characters like Peach, Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba appear in the game.



Like Nintendo's other titles, Dr. Mario World is a free-to-play game that included optional in-app purchases, but apparently the game failed to catch on.



Bloomberg last year said that Nintendo is "retreating" from its mobile game plans, focusing on already-released titles rather than debuting new games. Nintendo has had success with games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, but has not been able to maintain sales momentum.



Nintendo previously discontinued Miitomo, Pokémon Duel, and Pokémon Rumble Rush. Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost, Super Mario Run, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, and Mario Kart Tour continue to be available.

Battlefield is built well for competition, and Portal’s opposing approach is something to celebrate
 Battlefield Portal is a new game mode in Battlefield 2042 that lets players mash up their favorite Battlefield time periods into a single game. An army of World War II soldiers against a handful of 2042 grunts; one tank against 100 tiny robots. It’s very ... FPS by way of Looney Tunes. Seemingly taking inspiration from Halo Forge, custom map creators, and other level editors, the mode promises something rare for the 20-year-old franchise: comedy.
But don’t expect Battlefield 2042’s Portal mode to be balanced for competitive play. Its focus is fun — the kind you can’t help but clip and share with friends.
What is Battlefield Portal?

‌AirTags‌ use coin-shaped CR2032 batteries, which happen to be a size that's easy to swallow. Some battery makers like Duracell have begun putting a bitter coating on CR2032 batteries to prevent children from eating them.



According to Duracell, hundreds of lithium coin batteries are accidentally swallowed by children each year, and these batteries can cause a harmful chemical reaction. The non-toxic bitter coating reacts with saliva and is meant to deter swallowing.

A familiar face returns to Philadelphia.
 The Flyers have brought back a name from the 2019-20 season in Nate Thompson to solidify their forward depth. The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange & Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.
Thompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.
With this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Rocky W. Widner/NHL/Getty Images
    

  
Well, there’s your backup goalie.
 After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.
Jones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.
Since the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.

As one commenter noted, all of the solidly “blue” states are above the vaxxed national average and all the solidly “red” states are below it. The picture is a little more muddy when you look at the rates at the county level:

The “conservatives are unvaxxed” trend is still there, but a lack of access and education around the vaccines in counties with large Black and Latino populations also plays a large role in whether people are vaccinated or not.

        <updated>2021-07-28T16:00:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.





TSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.



For context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the "A18" or the "M5." While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple's sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.



TSMC's manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.



The A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple's first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.



TSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.

Techdirt is one of the very, very, very few truly independent media brands around. Almost none of the independent media brands that existed when we started remain. Some have been sucked up into larger companies or shut down entirely. Others have decided to go behind expensive paywalls. We’ve had to adapt and change over the years in many ways just to stick around, but in the end the reason we do this is because of the community we’ve built up here. For us to stick around, I need to ask the community to help support us as well. We have some cool experiments and projects in the works, so stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, if you can help us out, it would be hugely appreciated.
Techdirt is irreplaceable. There’s no other site like it. And indeed, indie websites that neither run crappy ads nor put their content behind a paywall are a dying breed. You go to an article at Techdirt and you see the article. No annoying popovers begging you to subscribe to a newsletter. You just see the article.

A Chinese citizen who shared images of stolen Apple prototypes on social media was sent a warning letter from Fangda Partners, Apple's law firm in China, on June 18, 2021. An extract from the letter read:
You have disclosed without authorization a large amount of information related to Apple's unreleased and rumored products, which has constituted a deliberate infringement of Apple's trade secrets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I’ve written before, in the history of astronomy and astrophysics, women have made major discoveries and played a significant role in advancing our understanding of the universe but have often not gotten the recognition their male peers enjoy. In 1967, while she was working on her doctoral research with her advisor Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell Burnell (then Jocelyn Bell) discovered a new and unusual kind of object, the pulsar. In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.
In 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.
It’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.

 *Chuck is compiling quite a lot of natural leaders this summer. You love to see it.

*That’s right, Keith Yandle! Chuck signed him yesterday. [BSH] [Inquirer]
*It’s free agency day, the new July 1, if you will, and the Flyers still need a goaltender. Let’s look at some options. [BSH]
*But might the Flyers decide to go the trade route instead? [NBC Sports Philly]
*Either way, Charlie has a full breakdown of the whole market and who might be best for the Flyers right now. [The Athletic]
*Chuck’s done a lot of adding on the back end, a little tweaking to the top end, but what are we looking at in the middle? [BSH]
*Anyway, let’s talk about Cam Atkinson. Let’s let his excitement infect us all. [BSH]
*Oh yeah by the way, the Capitals signed Alex Ovechkin to five more years. Dude’s 100% definitely getting that record. It’s going to be so neat. [Japers’ Rink]
*The Vegas Golden Knights traded Marc-Andre Fleury — he just won the Vezina, in case you forgot — for... nothing. Nothing. [Knights On Ice]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular Apple TV+ show "For All Mankind" is currently shooting its third season, but Apple may have already authorized a fourth season of the drama, if information on an updated Writers Guild of America (WGA) webpage is accurate.





First spotted by Space Explored on Tuesday, the updated webpage contains a listing for season four of the show that suggests everyone currently involved in season three will return for another outing. 



According to the entry, series creator Ronald D. Moore will remain as showrunner while also serving as executive producer, alongside series stalwarts Ben Nedivi, Bradley Thompson, David O. Weddle, Matt Wolpert and Nichole M. Beattie.



With season three expected to be released in mid 2022, the WGA page has season four production kicking off that same year and running into 2023, so it'll be a while yet before we see it on Apple's streaming TV service, assuming the listing is correct. 



"For All Mankind" has proven to be one of Apple's more popular ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. It explores what might have happened if the global space race had never ended in an alternate history where the USSR beats the United States to the moon. The story is told through the lives of NASA astronauts and their families, who are at the center of extraordinary events. Apple confirmed season three had been green-lighted in December 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Juli Clover, MacRumors:
Prior to this beta, Safari on iPad was similar to Safari on iOS
with no dedicated tab bar, but after the update, Apple has added a
dedicated tab bar that’s activated by default, which is the same
layout that’s now used in macOS Monterey.
While the separate tab bar is enabled automatically when updating,
in the Safari section of Settings, there is an option to toggle on
the original compact tab bar that merged everything together.
This is a significant improvement for Safari on iPad, and showing the tab bar is the correct default. If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.

        <updated>2021-07-28T01:58:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federico Viticci, on Twitter:
There’s a total of six different touch targets in the iOS 15
beta 4 tab bar in Safari.
These exclude the ability to long-press the tab bar, swipe across
it to change tabs, and swipe it up to open the Tabs view.
I’m … starting to think a single, small toolbar just won’t do. 😬
I responded that there are actually nine tap targets in the new toolbar in beta 4 — Viticci didn’t count the left / right edges that can be tapped like buttons to switch to the previous / next tabs. That’s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar. (My tweet says eight, but there are two separate tappable areas to bring up the URL address bar, one on each side of the minuscule reload button.)
Apple’s own example in the HIG of a toolbar that’s too crowded has … nine items.
Curtis Herbert:
I really do appreciate the experimentation, but the new Safari
feels like something I’d take to the UI Design Labs at WWDC and
they’d push me to use native controls that users expect and
already know, have better tap targets, and stop cramming too many
things in a small space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On iPhone:
The Share button is back in the toolbar, replacing the “···” don’t-call-it-a-hamburger-button. But there’s an awful lot of non-sharing stuff crammed into the Share menu — the ᴀA menu items from the current version of Safari (text size, Reader mode, disabling content blockers temporarily, etc.) are all in “Share” now. It’s better than the “···” menu in betas 1–3, but really, this is more like changing the “···” glyph to the Share glyph. It’s still two menus’ worth of features stuffed into one monolithic menu.


The Reload button is back. But it’s bizarrely tiny — way smaller than the minimum recommended tap target size of 44 x 44 points. And it shares space with the newly restored Reader mode button. When you load a page, if Reader mode is available, the Reader mode button shows briefly (maybe for 1–2 seconds?) along with the text “Reader Available” under the website’s domain name. But then the “Reader Available” label fades out and the Reader mode button turns into the Reload button. To enable Reader mode at this point, you either need to long-press the URL domain name to bring up a shortcut menu, or tap the — you guessed it — Share button, which has its own “Reader” item near the top.


Bookmarks are supposed to be easier to access, but I think most users accustomed to previous versions of Mobile Safari — which heretofore has always had a bookmarks button right in the main toolbar — are going to struggle to find them.



Apple is clearly trying to address the numerous complaints about the Safari 15 design for iPhone, but beta 4 feels like they’ve decided that the solution to finding themselves in a hole is to dig faster.

A Wall Street Journal investigation found that TikTok only needs
one important piece of information to figure out what you want:
the amount of time you linger over a piece of content. Every
second you hesitate or rewatch, the app is tracking you.
Not surprising it works this way, but creepy nonetheless. Update: I’ve long suspected that Instagram does something similar, with regard to its often uncanny “Hey, I was just looking at pictures of those…” ads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's earnings call for the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked how Apple decides what components to purchase and what components to develop, and Cook said that Apple asks if it can be done better. 




We ask ourselves if we can do something better. If we can deliver a better product. If we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we can do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we have an ability to do something better and therefore make a better product for the user. 
Cook went on to explain that the M1 chip is a great example of that. "We have the ability within our silicon team to make a product that's appreciably better than what we could buy," he said. 



Response to the ‌M1‌ chip has been "unbelievable," and has been powering Mac and iPad sales that are constrained. "That's how we look at that and whether we should enter a market or not," said Cook.



The ‌M1‌ chip has allowed Apple to cut ties with Intel, and Apple is no longer reliant on Intel technology or Intel release timelines. In the future, Apple is also planning to come out with its own modem chips, reducing its reliance on Qualcomm.

Cook said that it was the largest upgrade quarter for Q3 ever, and that the iPhone 12 upgrade cycle on the whole was "very strong." Sales of the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max were "particularly strong."



Going forward, Cook said that Apple feels "really good" about the future of the ‌iPhone‌ because 5G penetration remains "very low" and there's a lot of opportunity for sales growth in the 5G market. "We're in the very early innings of 5G," Cook said. "There are only a couple countries that are in the double digits."



The high number of new ‌iPhone‌ users and ‌iPhone‌ users upgrading to new models drove record sales momentum, with the ‌iPhone‌ ultimately bringing in $39.6 billion during the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's earnings call covering the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple CFO Luca Maesteri said that Apple is expecting supply constraints to affect the iPhone and the iPad in the coming quarter.





"The supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher in the September quarter," said Maestri. The constraints will impact ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ sales in particular.



It is not clear if these predicted supply constraints will affect the iPhone 13 models that are expected to launch in September.



Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked whether the supply constraints will continue into the holiday quarter, but Cook said that he doesn't want to predict that. "We're going to take it one quarter at a time," he said. "We will do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt." Cook went on to say that the constraints that Apple is seeing are the same constraints that are impacting other companies as well.
The majority of the constraints are of the variety that others are seeing. I would classify it as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.
Cook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.

Cloud services, ‌Apple Music‌, advertising, video, and payments saw all-time revenue records, while the ‌App Store‌ saw a new June quarter revenue record. 



During the earnings call announcing the results, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple's install base of devices hit a new all-time high as well, which helps drive services growth.



Apple now has more than 700 million paid subscriptions, which is up 150 million from last year, and is four times the number of subscriptions that Apple had four years ago. 



Paid accounts on digital content stores reached a new all-time high across each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased by double digits. 



Apple CEO Tim Cook highlighted the 35 Emmy nominations that ‌Apple TV+‌ shows have received, and he said that ‌Apple TV+‌ viewers are loving shows like "Ted Lasso" and "Mythic Quest."

According to Apple's latest earnings report for the third fiscal quarter of 2021 (second calendar quarter), Apple's Mac category brought in $8.8 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. 





Sales were just a bit down from the second fiscal quarter of 2021, when Apple's Macs brought in $9.1 billion in revenue. iPad revenue was at $7.4 billion, up from $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter and again, just barely trailing Apple's second quarter earnings results. 



According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, while the Mac set a new June quarter revenue record. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the last four quarters have been the Mac's best four quarters ever. 



The earnings report covers sales of the M1 Mac and ‌iPad‌ machines, including the ‌M1‌ 24-inch iMac and the ‌M1‌ iPad Pro models that were released earlier this year.

Do I really want to re-buy F1 2020 cosmetics? No. Would I? Yeah.
 Let me preface this petty complaint by saying that I have about 12 hours of on-track time in F1 2021’s career mode alone, about two weeks after the game launched. I adore this game, and it will devour hundreds of my waking hours over the next year. But it’s for that reason I’m raising this stink: The customization unlocks and options, so far, are weak. Unacceptably weak.
The first eight-week season of the game’s Podium Pass offers just five vehicle liveries — and the colors cannot be altered for two of them, including an “epic” all-black livery called Shado…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vox, Emily Stewart writes about the shortcomings of the, er, system we’ve developed here in America of outsourcing public needs to private industry: Corporations aren’t going to save America.
Across various segments of American life, the private sector has begun to take on tasks big and small that one might think should be tackled by the public sector. Domino’s filled in potholes. Dawn’s dish soap saved ducks. American Express pitched in on historic preservation. Walmart started selling low-priced insulin. A slew of companies help workers pay for school. Much of America’s health care system is still handled through private insurers and your job. As people lose faith in government to act on sweeping issues such as climate change and guns, they’re increasingly looking to corporate America and asking whether there’s something they can do about it. If Congress won’t tackle gun violence, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods can try.
It’s not a bad thing for brands and companies to try to make the world better. Starting a business often involves identifying a problem to solve, and it’s much better for companies to help than to do harm. Corporate social responsibility is fine. There are, however, limits.
“Of course we want businesses to be responsible,” said Suzanne Kahn, managing director of research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. But she emphasized that this does not constitute a plan for how to organize society. “Private companies don’t, can’t, or won’t plan with the same values that we demand and expect the government to.”

And we’re not here to re-litigate whether this was too steep a price to pay, but we’re just here to acknowledge that the Flyers are already at something of a disadvantage when it comes to grading this draft, as they weren’t able to add as much dynamic talent through the top of this draft as they’ve been able to in the past. So there’s that. 
Who they added
Round 2, No. 46: Samu Tuomaala, RW, Kärpät (Liiga).

So Nissan teamed up with sound designers at Bandai Namco, the gaming company known for Pac-Man and Tekken, to replace those warning noises with something more musical.

I had a car once that beeped really sharply and loudly whenever the temperature dropped to 37°F as a warning for potential slippery roads and it scared the shit out of me every time. As someone who is sensitive to sound, I applaud efforts like these to make non-emergency sounds less jarring. (via rob walker (again))

 So far this offseason, Flyers General Manager Chuck Fletcher has ensured that the team we will see at the start of the 2021-22 season will look vastly different to the one that left us disappointed in 2020-21. By trading for Ryan Ellis, Rasmus Ristolainen, and Cam Atkinson, Fletcher not only brings in new key pieces to the squad (as much as Ristolainen may be lamented, he is “key” in that they gave up a first round pick for him and he could seriously help or hinder the team), but clearly is attempting to change the sentiment in the dressing room. All three players are considered leaders, and based on Fletcher’s comments, that was something he felt the te…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest beta update of macOS Monterey, released to developers today, has brought Live Text functionality to Intel-based Mac computers, removing the requirement for users to use an M1 Apple silicon Mac to utilize the feature, according to Rene Ritchie.





Live Text, included in the forthcoming ‌macOS Monterey‌, iOS 15, and iPadOS 15 updates, allows users to interact with text within images, such as phone numbers, addresses, and more. With Live Text, text inside images also becomes selectable, allowing users to cut and copy the text into apps. 



Apple at first stated that an ‌M1‌ Apple silicon Mac is a requirement for Live Text on ‌macOS Monterey‌, but with the latest beta, it's been expanded to Intel-based Mac computers.




macOS Monterey Beta 4 includes Live Text for Intel Macs 🎉
Sounds like Apple prioritized it based on demand, but it was made much easier by the lack of real-time requirements for a camera system

The new Safari design in iPadOS 15 beta 4


Prior to this beta, Safari on iPad was similar to Safari on iOS with no dedicated tab bar, but after the update, Apple has added a dedicated tab bar that's activated by default, which is the same layout that's now used in macOS Monterey.




The original Safari design in ‌iPadOS 15‌ beta 3


While the separate tab bar is enabled automatically when updating, in the Safari section of Settings, there is an option to toggle on the original compact tab bar that merged everything together.



Apple in iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌ introduced a compact and unified Safari design that did away with the dedicated URL and search interface, instead letting any individual tab be used for navigation input.





This design has not been popular with users, which has led to Apple making some changes during the beta testing period. As of now, Safari on iPadOS mirrors Safari on ‌macOS Monterey‌, though additional design tweaks could come in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced two games that are coming soon to Apple Arcade, including the classic racing game "Asphalt 8: Airborne" from Gameloft and a new Zelda-inspired roleplaying game "Baldo" from Italian game studio NAPS team.



Originally released on the App Store in 2013, "Asphalt 8: Airborne" is coming to Apple Arcade, but no specific release date has been announced. The popular racing game features more than 240 real cars to select from automakers and brands such as Ferrari, Ducati, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bugatti, Mercedes, Audi, Ford, and Chevrolet.





"Baldo" is described as an action-adventure roleplaying game with puzzles, exploration, and combat, all set in a hand-drawn open world. Players will embark on a journey into a magical land full of mysteries to discover as they complete the main story quest and many side quests. The game will be available on Apple Arcade starting Friday, August 27.





Another racing game "Detonation Racing" launches on Apple Arcade this Friday, with players having to navigate an environment rigged to blow up, collapse, and burst into flames at the least convenient moments. The game hails from Electric Square, the creators of another popular racing game "Forza Street" and the "Hot Wheels id" racing system.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

The newest member of the Philadelphia Flyers, is, jacked up.
 It took me probably about 20 minutes after the trade that brought winger Cam Atkinson from the Columbus Blue Jackets to the Philadelphia Flyers for Jakub Voracek, for me to go “oh yeah, duh that makes sense.”
Almost an immediate thumb up in Chuck Fletcher’s direction, this straight one-for-one swap has cured a lot of things for the Flyers and is just bringing in a kind soul that will make us feel better when they lose 5-3 to the New Jersey Devils for some damn reason. Atkinson has been one of the Good Guys in Columbus and just seems like a pleasant dude.
That much was evident in his first national appearance as a member of the Flyers on NHL Network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[William Gallagher, reporting for AppleInsider:
In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, investment firm JP
Morgan Chase’s China office has reported to its clients that Apple
intends to introduce a titanium alloy to the iPhone for the first
time. Apple has already used titanium in some Apple Watch models,
for the physical Apple Card, and at times for the PowerBook.
Titanium’s toughness, though, is only achieved when it used as
part of a titanium alloy with other metals. Titanium is also prone
to smudges from fingerprints, and its finish can be unattractive.
Apple is therefore certain to be using an alloy, and it presumably
addresses these issues.
I hope this is true. Stainless steel is just too heavy; titanium would be a much nicer premium upgrade over aluminum. The titanium Apple Watch models are great, especially the Space Black model with a highly scratch-resistant DLC finish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Al Jazeera:
The first person charged under Hong Kong’s national security law
has been found guilty of “terrorism” and “inciting secession”, in
a landmark case with long-term implications for how the
legislation reshapes the city’s common law traditions.
Former waiter Tong Ying-kit, 24, was accused of driving his
motorcycle in July last year into three riot police officers while
carrying a flag with the protest slogan: “Liberate Hong Kong,
revolution of our times”, which prosecutors said was secessionist.
An alternative charge of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily
harm was not considered in Tuesday’s widely anticipated ruling,
much of which has hinged on the interpretation of the slogan. […]
The ruling imposes new limits on free speech in the former British
colony. Pro-democracy activists and human rights groups have also
criticised the decision to deny Tong bail and a jury trial, which
have been key features of Hong Kong’s rule of law.
This is utterly unsurprising, but crushing nonetheless.

Explaining the summer’s indie darling
 There are few games like Cruelty Squad. It’s a brilliant entry into the immersive sim genre that critiques capitalism and the military-industrial complex. It’s also — and there’s no polite way to say this — a complete assault on the senses. The game is ugly, loud, and difficult. Playing Cruelty Squad can feel a lot like trying to eat a coconut with your bare hands. Yeah, there’s very clearly some good stuff in there, but for now I’m gnawing on this weird, hairy shell and starving.
All you have to do is look at the game to understand my trepidation. Everything is painted in bright, jarring colors. The menu text looks like it was scrawled in MS Paint with someone’s non-dominant hand. Cruelty Squad places its warped …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2001, performance art group Improv Everywhere have been staging events in public, aiming to “surprise and delight random strangers through positive pranks”. Their latest endeavor takes place in NYC, perhaps the best place on Earth for exposing random strangers to positive pranks. A man in an orange vest places a “Stand Here for Dance Party” sign on the ground and then walks away. A brave soul steps onto the sign and, well, you might guess what happens next.
I found this via Rob Walker’s newsletter about his book, The Art of Noticing. I love what he wrote about it:
Now that you’ve seen it, you know that once someone did stand on the decal, a squad of Improv Everywhere operatives, with boom boxes and impressive dance moves, converted the public space into (as promised) an open-air dance party. Very fun.
But here’s what makes this work: Not just the planning and the expert performers and the slick choreography and the clever subversion of social-distance design. None of that matters unless somebody stands on the decal. What activates this entire operation is curiosity.


He continues, describing the woman who gets the party started:
This woman is my hero! I love everything about her, her body language, her openness, the thrilling sense she radiates that anything could happen and she’s up for it. And if you’ve watched the video, you know that she in fact unleashed an experience that she (and many strangers nearby) will never forget.
What’s not in the video, but we know is true, is some huge majority of people not even noticing, or actively ignoring, the invitation to an impromptu, on-the-spot dance party. As always, attention is the first step.


Curiosity. Attention. There are those words again, the universe trying to tell me something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers are rethinking plans to use the Apple Watch in studies after finding inconsistencies in the data gathered by the device (via The Verge).





Inconsistencies in the Apple Watch's heart rate variability data are reportedly caused by Apple tweaking the device's algorithms, meaning that data from the same time period can change without warning. Associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the Beiwe data platform, J.P. Onnela, told The Verge:
These algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they're not transparent. So it's impossible to know what's in them.




Research fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital exported the heart rate data from Apple Watches for the same period of time, but several months apart. The data should have been identical, but since it is filtered through an algorithm prior to export it was drastically different.



Apple changes its algorithms regularly and without warning, so exporting the same data at different times may use different algorithms. Beyond heart rate variability, researchers looking into sleep tracking have experienced similar problems with changes to algorithms.



This mostly precludes commercial devices from being used by researchers, resulting in the need for devices specifically designed to collect data for scientific studies. While this is adequate for some studies, it heavily constrains research into the medical value of commercially available products for users. Some researchers say that Apple should publicize the changes it makes to algorithms or make the Apple Watch's raw data available.

The Flyers acquired Voracek in 2011 as part of a locker room change and was traded 10 years later in another roster shakeup.
 On June 23rd, 2011, the Flyers made a pair of trades that changed the direction of the franchise. They shipped out Mike Richards and Jeff Carter in two separate deals and got back a handful of young players. Among them was Jakub Voracek from Columbus.
Carter was sent to Columbus by the Flyers but then reunited with Richards in Los Angeles via trade. There, they went on to win two Stanley Cups, including one with Ron Hextall as Kings Vice President and Assistant General Manager. A decade later, Hextall traded for an aging Jeff Carter at the trade deadline while Voracek got traded in the offseason.

Knight searches for the right words. “I don’t want to sound
negative,” he says. Knight explains some of Kidd’s methods, such
as how Kidd would embarrass the culprit of an error by making
everyone but that person run sprints for his mistake. “He just had
his way of getting his point across,” Knight says.
Little things were made to be a big deal: At one point center Thon
Maker didn’t have an iPhone, messing up the team’s blue-bubble
iPhone group chat. Kidd was upset about it and made the team run
because Kidd felt that Maker not getting an iPhone was an example
of the team not being united.
So now we know there’s a basketball court inside Apple’s walled garden.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buzz Andersen, in a guest post for Why Is This Interesting:
Eventually, a Russian artist and Twitter user named Gregory
Khodyrev realized what was going on: someone at Russia’s
state Internet censor, Roscomnadzor, had attempted to block the
Internet domain “t.co” (used by Twitter’s URL shortener), but had
instead managed to cut off access to any domain containing the
text pattern “t.co.” This meant that sites such as
“microsoft.com,” “reddit.com,” and even Russia’s own state media
outlet “rt.com” were rendered suddenly inaccessible.
Readers with a modicum of technical knowledge may already have an
inkling of what likely happened here: some hapless censor,
attempting to curb Twitter’s political influence, installed a
URL pattern matching rule on Russia’s national firewall that
turned out to have been just a tad overzealous. The rule in
question was almost certainly expressed using a notoriously
abstruse notation called a “regular expression.”

The Oculus iPhone app has code that would allow workouts completed with the Oculus headset to be recorded in the Health app like other workout data. The Oculus app would be able to report health-related metrics like exercise minutes and number of calories burned.



Third-party apps have long been able to provide workout and fitness data that's aggregated in the Health app using the dedicated HealthKit API.



As Bloomberg points out, the code's presence in the Oculus app does not mean the feature will actually see a launch.

From the highs to the lows, it’s more Musou
 I’ve been a fan and player of Musou games (or “Warriors games,” if you’re a dubs instead of subs person) since they were brand-spanking new — 20 years at this point. I’ve been with them from 2000’s Dynasty Warriors 2, the very first, right up to now. After a week and a half with Samurai Warriors 5, I have a confession to make:
I don’t know how to talk to people about Musou games anymore.
When Polygon approached me about writing this piece, the original idea was that I would be writing a review of Samurai Warriors 5, from a Musou lifer’s perspective. So, as I played it, that’s the mindset I was in: Looking at gameplay, graphics, presentation elements, how it “felt.” I could definitely write that story if I wanted to.  …]]></summary>

There is no word on which chips Intel will make for Qualcomm, but Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips are used in most Android smartphones. Though the 20A design is expected to be available starting in 2024, Intel did not provide a timeline for when it will begin working with Qualcomm.



Intel says that its 20A manufacturing process introduces RibbonFET, the first new transistor architecture since FinFET in 2011. The 20A technology brings faster transistor switching speeds and a smaller footprint. Before the 20A chips are ready, Intel will be working on Intel 7, Intel 4, and Intel 3 chi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of iOS 14.7 last week, Apple has stopped signing iOS 14.6, the previously available version of iOS that was released in May. With iOS 14.6 no longer being signed, it is not possible to downgrade to iOS 14.6 if you've already installed iOS 14.7 or iOS 14.7.1.





Apple routinely stops signing older versions of software updates after new releases come out in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date.



iOS 14.6 was a major update that added Apple Watch iPhone unlocking, Apple Maps accident crowdsourcing, Apple Card Family sharing, AirTag improvements, and more.



iOS 14.7, the update that replaces iOS 14.6, added MagSafe Battery Pack support and introduced numerous bug fixes. Apple today also released iOS 14.7.1, a smaller update that includes a critical security fix and a fix for a bug that could prevent Touch ID iPhones from unlocking a connected Apple Watch.

Philadelphia has prepped some RFAs for future deals.
 Less than 48 hours before the gates of free agency opens and the NHL turns into a clutch-and-grab league again with available players, the Philadelphia Flyers have qualified goaltender Carter Hart, defenseman Travis Sanheim, and forwards Connor Bunnaman and David Kase.
We have extended qualifying offers to the following four players:
 • Connor Bunnaman
• Carter Hart
• David Kase
• Travis Sanheim pic.twitter.com/eZuFkIe1yo
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 26, 2021



Essentially just a formality, these qualifying offers will keep these players rights in Philadelphia and won’t just let them walk into unrestricted free agency. In recent memory, only Nolan Patrick accepted his qualifying offer as a new, one-year contract for the Flyers that is at 105 percent at the player’s most recent cap hit.
The only player the Flyers did not send a qualifying offer to was forward Pascal Laberge, a former second-round pick back in 2016 that hasn’t even amassed 100 games in Lehigh Valley.
Hart and Sanheim were the obvious choices and will be the two guaranteed current restricted free agents that will be in the Flyers’ lineup at the start of next season, but in Bunnaman and Kase, there are some very solid depth options for the Flyers that will no doubt be cheap short-term deals.
At least there aren’t any headache-inducing contract negotiations this year.]]></summary>

As the saying goes, fate has dealt me one from the bottom of the deck, and I am now condemned to confront the question that has plagued me for years: How does a person spend what he knows are his final months of life?
Atop the list of things I’ll miss are the smiles and hugs every morning from my beautiful wife, Geraldine, the greatest blessing of my life. I hate the notion of an eternity without hearing laughter from my three children. And what about my 40 rose bushes? Who will nurture them? I cannot imagine an afterlife without the red of my America roses or the aroma of my yellow Julia Childs.
We told each of the three children individually. John Patrick put his face in his hands, racked with sobs. After hanging up the telephone, Jennifer doubled over and wept until her dog, Rosie, approached to lick away the tears but not the melancholy. Faith explained over the telephone that, if I could see her, she was weeping and wondering how she could get along without her dad. Now, she is on the Internet every day, snorkeling for new research, new strategies, new medications. My wife cries every morning, then rolls up her sleeves and handles all doctor appointments and medication. Without her… I cannot imagine.

See Unreal Engine 5 running on Xbox Series X
 Gears of War developer The Coalition showed off what the studio — and the Xbox Series X — is capable of with Epic Games’ new Unreal Engine. In a pair of demos, which The Coalition made clear “do not represent a game product,” we get a peek at ultra-realistic character rendering and two major new features of Unreal Engine 5: Lumen and Nanite.
The character rendering demo shows a human male character rendered in extreme detail: His body is composed of 130,000 triangles, with another 31,000 dedicated to his face alone. His hair, beard, and eyebrows eat up another 3.5 million.
In another demo, The Coalition showcases the real-time lighting and reflection technology, called Lumen, in Unreal Engine 5, and Nanite, “which allows for unlimited triangle budget.” Epic Games announced those UE5 features in May 2020, as part of a showcase of the game engine running on PlayStation 5 hardware, but here’s another sun-baked, particle-rich, and glowing-mirrored-obelisk look at the graphics tech in action:


The Coalition announced in May that it was winding down development on Gears of War 5, and shifting to new, unannounced projects using Unreal Engine 5. The Coalition said it will be developing with UE5 “for multiple new projects in the coming years.”
Epic announced Unreal Engine 5 last year, and made the technology available in preview form in early 2021. A full release is slated for late 2021. Unreal Engine 5 will be available for both current-generation and last-generation consoles, as well as Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows PC. UE5 is being developed with forward compatibility in mind, Epic says, letting developers create games in Unreal Engine 4 and move them to the next-generation engine later.
For a full look at The Coalition’s Unreal Engine 5 tech demos, check out the developer’s hourlong GDC 2021 presentation on YouTube.]]></summary>

 Forza Horizon 5 developer Playground Games is promising the largest map to date in the 9-year-old open-world racing series. That gives Playground room to render 11 different biomes, which the game’s designers detailed on Xbox Wire on Monday afternoon.
The locations range from the streets of Guanajuato City (a city of about 200,000 in central Mexico) to a cactus desert filled with the tall saguaros for which the northwest state of Sonora is well known. “Each of the 11 unique biomes will transition through the seasons differently,” Xbox Wire said, referencing the changing-seasons feature introduced in 2018’s Forza Horizon 4, set in the United Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Lee, on Twitter:
I’ve been fascinated to watch the reaction to Safari in iOS 15 because in 2016-2017, I worked on a similar redesign for mobile Chrome that we never launched. Finally decided to tell a bit of that story here.
His story:
I created the original concept and pitch for Chrome Home in 2016. It was based off two insights:
Phones were growing in size, and we had opportunity to innovate in creating a gestural, spatial interface that would still be usable with one hand.


Mobile Chrome was also growing in features — but because its minimalist interface kept everything behind a “three dot” menu, these features were underutilized and hard to access.



The idea caught traction internally, eventually becoming a Chrome org priority. […]
We heard a mixture of reactions. The feature gained a cult following among the tech community, but for many mainstream users, the change felt disorienting. Chrome serves billions of users around the globe with varying tech literacy. Over the course of many iterations, I became increasingly convinced that launching Chrome Home would not serve all our users well.
So just as I strongly as I had pitched the original concept, I advocated for us to stop the launch — which took not a small amount of debate.
Really curious to see what the next betas of Safari look like on iOS and iPadOS. I spent all weekend with my spare phone running iOS 15 b3 and the new Safari design is not growing on me, at all.

Rumors about the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 have been picking up in recent weeks ahead of its prospective launch this fall.



Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ could measure in at 8.5 to 9 inches, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ will have a larger display with slimmed down bezels.




Grew from 7.9" due to narrower bezels and removal of Home button.
— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) July 26, 2021
 


There was mixed information on whether the new ‌iPad mini‌ would have a Home button, but rumors now appear to be coalescing around an iPad Air 4-like design with no Home button and either Face ID or a Touch ID power button.



The new ‌iPad mini‌ could include either an A14 chip or an A15 chip, plus it is expected to have a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, which would bring Apple closer to dropping Lightning on the iPad lineup.



DigiTimes recently suggested the new ‌iPad mini‌ would have a mini-LED display, but a report from Young last week disputed that information and said the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will have a standard display rather than a mini-LED display.

Apple says that an application may have been able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges due to a memory corruption issue. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," reads the document.



The vulnerability has been addressed with improved memory handling, and because this is a security issue that may have affected some users, all iPhone and iPad users should update to iOS 14.7.1 and iPadOS 14.7.1 as soon as possible. The same vulnerability has also been addressed in the macOS Big Sur 11.5.1 update.



The iOS 14.7.1 update also fixes a bug that could prevent Touch ID iPhones from unlocking an Apple Watch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today updated its Apple at Work website with a new section dedicated to the Mac, which offers up 11 reasons why "Mac means business."





On the webpage, Apple highlights the M1 chip as the number one reason why business users should choose a Mac, offering up an ‌M1‌ overview [PDF] that explains the benefits of the ‌M1‌ chip. The information isn't new, but it does provide a look at all of Apple's ‌M1‌ marketing materials.



The ‌M1‌, Apple explains, offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, 50 percent faster web app responsiveness, and 2x longer battery life when video conferencing on Zoom.
When compared with the latest model of the best-selling PC notebook purchased by businesses in its price range, MacBook Air with M1 offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, up to 50% faster web application responsiveness, up to 2x faster browser graphics performance and up to 2x longer battery life when video conferencing with Zoom on a single charge.
Apple also highlights the MacBook Air's long battery life, device security, and integration with iPhone as reasons why the Mac is superior to PCs.



Businesses can set up Macs from anywhere with zero-touch deployment, and Macs are intuitive to use and easy to manage with features like Migration Assistant so companies won't need to rely as much on IT support staff. Apple cites a study that says the Mac is less expensive to run because it needs fewer support tickets and less software, saving businesses up to $843 over a three-year period.



According to Apple, 84 percent of the "world's top innovators" like Salesforce, SAP, and Target run Macs at scale, and business apps "run beautifully" on the Mac. Apple's site aims to convince businesses that employees should be given the "power to work the way they want" using the "tools they love" to inspire them to do better work.

Behind that position is a business quandary: Even as other automakers have embraced electric cars, Toyota bet its future on the development of hydrogen fuel cells — a costlier technology that has fallen far behind electric batteries — with greater use of hybrids in the near term. That means a rapid shift from gasoline to electric on the roads could be devastating for the company’s market share and bottom line.
This sounds like a once-great company that has lost its way. The real Toyota would lead the way to the future.

Trailer shows off Seer and the new Rampage gun
 World’s Edge is getting a massive makeover in Apex Legends’ newest season. Respawn Entertainment released a trailer on Monday to show off the newly destroyed version of the map along with some of the other features of the Apex Legends season 10: Emergence, including Seer, the game’s new Legend, and the new Rampage weapon.
World’s Edge was already filled with the lava and all sorts of other hazards, but the new “decimated” version of the map seems to make it more treacherous than ever. Lava is expanding into new parts of the map, as buildings and terrain are destroyed by some kind of calamity. In one of the earlier trailers, there’s even an avalanche of some kind for players to outrun. The trailer only gives quick glimpses of areas of the map, but it seems like large portions will be totally changed when the new season is released. 
The new map update isn’t the only change that Respawn is bringing with season 10 either. Seer already seems like one of the game’s most exciting Legends and he gets another spotlight in this trailer. We see him shooting down enemies as well as tracking them with his various nanotech abilities, including his Ultimate, which places a dome over a small area of the map and tracks anyone moving quickly inside. 
The Emergence update will also include a new weapon called Rampage, which seems to be a slow-firing but very powerful rifle. Of course, there will also be a battle pass to go along with the new season that includes character and weapon skins for players to unlock as they play. 
Apex Legends season 10 and all of its additions are set to go live on Aug. 3.]]></summary>

 Blizzard Entertainment’s co-founder and a longtime writer who helped create the Warcraft universe, neither of whom work for the company today, gave statements this weekend expressing regret and contrition for a workplace culture that California authorities allege exposed employees to continuous gender-based discrimination and harassment.
Chris Metzen, until 2016 Blizzard’s vice president for story and franchise development, and Mike Morhaime, the publisher’s chief executive until 2018, are the most senior Blizzard officers, past or present, to comment on the lawsuit that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this collaboration between musician and filmmaker John Boswell (aka melodysheep) and the sound podcast Twenty Thousand Hertz, we get to listen to some of the actual and theoretical sounds of space, from what the Sun would sound like if space weren’t a vacuum (we’d hear it as loud as a jackhammer on Earth) to the sound of the Universe just after the Big Bang to thunder in the thick atmosphere of Venus to dreamlike piano music on Mars.
Floating in the silent void of space are trillions of islands of sound, each with their own sonic flavor — some eerily familiar, some wildly different than Earth’s. And even space itself was once brimming with sound. 
This short film takes you on a journey back in time and to the edge of our solar system and beyond, to discover what other worlds of sound are lurking beyond Earth’s atmosphere. You won’t believe your ears :)


This is really well done, which isn’t surprising considering Boswell did the excellent Timelapse of the Future video a few years back. The soundtrack to The Sounds of Space video is available on Bandcamp. (via aeon)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Mac Pro that's coming in 2022 is set to use Intel's Ice Lake Xeon W-3300 workstation chips, according to an Intel leaker that WCCFtech says has offered reliable information on Intel Xeon chips in the past.





Intel's W-3300 Ice Lake CPUs are set to launch in the near future, and there have already been signs of new Ice Lake SP processors in the Xcode 13 beta. Intel has said that these chips offer "advanced performance, security, efficiency, and built-in AI acceleration to handle IoT workloads and more powerful AI."




Apple’s MacPro 2022 seems to use Intel’s Xeon-W 33xx series processors... 
(LGA4189 iceLake-SP)
— 结城安穗-YuuKi_AnS (@yuuki_ans) July 26, 2021
 


Ice Lake chips for the ‌Mac Pro‌ would offer up to 38 cores and 76 threads, with the Xeon W-3775 positioned as Intel's top chip in the lineup. This top of the line chip features 57MB of cache and a 4.0GHz clock speed.



While Apple is transitioning its Mac lineup to Apple silicon and is developing a version of the ‌Mac Pro‌ that will run an Apple silicon chip, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that Apple will also update the Intel Mac Pro.



Apple is working on a smaller ‌Mac Pro‌ that's about half the size of the original and that is expected to include an Apple silicon chip, but alongside it, the company is also developing a new version of the current ‌Mac Pro‌.



The Intel-based ‌Mac Pro‌ that's in the works with Intel's W-3300 Ice Lake chips could be one of the last Intel Macs that Apple will develop. Apple has already begun transitioning the iMac, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air lines to Apple silicon.

The video walks through using the Ultra Wide camera for unique perspectives and it demonstrates different lighting effects that can be used to make a cinematic feel.



There's a technique on a DIY crane shot captured by dropping an ‌iPhone‌ onto a soft surface, and a supernatural effect done with a camping headlamp and a bike wheel.



Apple regularly shares Shot on ‌iPhone‌ videos, and for the last several months, has been doing "Everyday Experiments" videos that often show behind the scenes techniques much like today's film techniques video.

The vehicles have also returned to Belgium to survey additional regions after focusing on the Brussels area last year.

Apple will use the data collected to improve its Maps app and expand its Look Around feature, which is currently limited to parts of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Japan. Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around is similar to Google's Street View, providing 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned.



Where available, Look Around can be accessed by tapping the binoculars icon in the top-right corner of the Maps app. Look Around also appears in the search results for a supported city, below the Flyover and Directions buttons.



Apple Maps vehicles began surveying efforts in 2015, collecting data in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Singapore, Israel, and select other countries and territories. 



On its website, Apple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting surveys. For example, Apple blurs out faces and license plates in street-level imagery made available through Look Around.

After playing Neo: The World Ends with You, a reboot-cum-sequel to a critically-acclaimed 14-year-old Nintendo DS game, this question sits at the forefront for me.

The story centers around the still-little-known barn where Till was tortured and murdered by a group of several white men in 1955.
But the way Till’s name exists in the firmament of American history stands in opposition to the gaps in what we know about his killing. No one knows, for instance, how many people were involved. Most historians think at least seven were present. Only two were tried: half brothers J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Another half brother, Leslie Milam, was there that night too. He lived in an old white farmhouse a few dozen steps from the barn, next to where Jeff Andrews’s house now stands.
In 1955 an all-white, all-male jury, encouraged by the defense to do their duty as “Anglo-Saxons,” acquitted J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Because the defendants couldn’t be tried again, they got paid to make a confession to a national magazine — a heavily fictionalized account stage-managed by their lawyers — and Leslie Milam and his barn were written out of the story. Ask most people where Till died and they’ll say Money, Mississippi, the town where Till whistled at Bryant’s wife outside the family’s store. An Equal Justice Initiative monument in Montgomery says Money. Wikipedia does too. The Library of Congress website skips over the barn, which is just outside the town of Drew, about 45 minutes from the store.
I learned about the barn last year and have since made repeated visits, alone and with groups, once with members of Till’s family. Over and over, I drove from my home in the Mississippi hill country back into the gothic flatland where I was born. The barn’s existence conjures a complex set of reactions: It is a mourning bench for Black Americans, an unwelcome mirror for white Americans. It both repels and demands attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lamborghini is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Countach sports car with a new video series involving inspirational personalities, and the latest videos shared today feature Apple's former marketing chief Phil Schiller.





Schiller, who is now an Apple Fellow, said innovative products that stand the test of time have both great design and solve a problem.



"At Apple, we like to exist at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts, and I think that's a wonderful place to be," said Schiller. "It's not just enough to make something — you have to make it in a way that has meaning in people's lives."






In a companion Q&A video on Lamborghini's website, Schiller said the iPod is the project he is the most proud of. When asked if he prefers gas or electric vehicles, Schiller said that while he would always say combustion engines, he is "getting ready for electric" and he is excited to see what companies like Lamborghini can deliver in the space. Lamborghini recently announced plans to release its first fully-electric vehicle after 2025, and Apple has for years been rumored to be planning its own electric vehicle.



As an Apple Fellow, Schiller is responsible for leading the App Store and Apple Events, after helping guide Apple's products and marketing for 30 years. 



(Thanks, Benjamin Cartwright!)

The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services heard for-and-against arguments from Apple, Google, and others relating to whether Apple should open up access to its near-field communication (NFC) chip. Australia's big banks have also sought open access to the NFC chip on the iPhone in recent years.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *So kind of a big weekend, huh pals? Let’s start with the draft and work our way up, excitement-wise. The Flyers made some picks over the weekend, and if you missed them, here’s a full rundown: 
A Finnish winger was up first, with the 46th overall pick. [BSH]
Chuck went with a goalie with his next pick, number 78. [BSH]
 At 110th overall they went defense. Really rounding things out huh? [BSH]
Another defenseman, this time from California, with pick 158. [BSH]
And ANOTHER defenseman at 174! [BSH]
And finally, at 206th, a center. [BSH]
*That kid they took at 206 is a local boy! You love to see it. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of local boys, Brian Boucher’s kid was drafted! Yes, that’s correct, you are that old. [Inquirer]
*Full run down of the draft weekend’s winners and losers, if you’re interested. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Okay let’s get to the big stuff! The Flyers’ first pick was number 46 because they traded the 13th pick, and a bunch of other stuff, to the Buffalo Sabres for Rasmus Ristolainen. Charlie unpacks it all for you. [The Athletic] 
*Folks will probably like Risto, who says he’s excited to get here and be a “pain in the ass.” [NBC Sports Philly]
*After that bit of spiciness Chuck got even spicier, finally finding a place to send Jake Voracek. Back from whence he came, actually. [BSH]
*Charlie unpacks the Voracek trade as well, which honestly might end up being the biggest move of the summer. [The Athletic]
*And finally, the Ghost trade might have been the move made thus far that is the most... annoying? Frustrating? Whatever your feelings on it, it had to be done. And it’s good Chuck did it. [NBC Sports Philly]]]></summary>

In the newsletter, Gurman says that he believes Apple's ultimate goal is to shift all of its products to Face ID, including the lower-end iPhones such as the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which feature Touch ID. Gurman says ‌Touch ID‌ remains an important part of Apple's product lineup, especially for lower-end models, thanks to it being a "cheaper alternative" to Face ID while continuing to provide security to users.

But I expect that to eventually change. It won’t happen this year, but I’d bet Face ID on the Mac is coming within a couple of years. I expect all iPhones and iPads to transition to Face …]]></summary>

A center, at long last.
 That’s all, folks! The Flyers have made their final* selection of the 2021 Entry Draft and picked up center Owen McLaughlin. 
*unless they very quickly make another trade and add a second seventh round pick at the last minute to make me look liar. 
McLaughlin spent the bulk of his season playing at the U18 AAA level with Mount St. Charles Academy, where he put up a decidedly not too shabby 16 goals and 38 assists in 33 games played. 
He also had a brief run playing with the US NTDP at the end of the season, with four and seven games in that USHL/USDP split. He didn’t pick up any points in that span, but getting that opportunity in the first place is no small accomplishment. And between that and McLaughlin’s scoring numbers at the high school level, there’s a whole lot that’s interesting about his profile. And coming in the seventh round, it’s a really nice low risk pick with the potential for a high reward. 
We also cannot resist mentioning that he’s pretty close to a Philly local, hailing from Spring City, PA. 
Per Flyers AGM Brent Flahr, McLaughlin will be going to Sioux City of the USHL next season, but once he moves on to the NCAA level, he’s committed to play at Penn State, and should be a nice addition to their program there.]]></summary>

More and more defensemen!
 Another pick, another defenseman. The Flyers are on a roll here, and they’ve picked up a third defenseman in a row with their sixth round, 174th overall pick in Ethan Samson. 
A product of the Prince George Cougars of the WHL, Samson is a right shot defenseman with decent size (6’1”, 194 pounds). While the Flyers’ first two pickups of the day on defense brought a bit more of a dynamic offensive game, Samson falls more into the mold of a defensive-defenseman. He was able to get a bit of power play time this season on top of his even strength and penalty kill responsibilities, and was still able to bring a bit of scoring to the table, with 12 points in his 22 games played. So there is a bit of offensive upside there, but it’s really Samson’s defensive game that stands out. 
He has a good motor and brings a nice bit of physicality. He anticipates plays well and brings a good defensive awareness, and we see that working well both in the defensive zone and at the blue line, as he works on breaking up entries. But he also still skates and passes well, so there is still a good bit of dynamic skill to his game, it’s not as though he’s just a one trick defensive pony, if you will. 
And the pipeline fills out further at defense!]]></summary>

Another defenseman from California, you say?
 How are we holding up, Flyers fans? The draft is still happening, the picks are rolling in, and the Flyers have picked up another defenseman!
With their 158th overall pick, the Flyers have selected Ty Murchison from the US National Team Development Program. Murchison put up modest scoring numbers in his draft year, with three goals and two assists in 23 games played (USHL) and seven goals and eight assists in 48 games played (USDP). He brings good size (6’2”, 192 pounds), but could still stand to get a little stronger. And while there’s still some polishing that needs to go into his game, all told, there’s a lot to like. He’s a smooth skater, and strong passer, and can transition the puck well. He brings a quick shot that he can get through traffic well, and that’s made him particularly effective on the power play. His defensive game needs some polishing, but his instincts are generally good, and he’s able to make use of good stick work to break up plays. The fundamentals are good. 
And we have two fun facts!
Ty Murchison, just picked up by the Flyers is a converted inline player. Headed to Arizona State next season. Told us at the U18s that Aidan Hreschuk, picked by Carolina in the third round, was one of the players who helped him convert to ice.
— Chris Peters (@chrismpeters) July 24, 2021



He also joins the likes of Cam York and Jack St. Ivany in the group of Flyers defense prospects from California, which is pretty neat!
Murchison will kick off his collegiate career with an Arizona State University program that just seems to be on the rise.]]></summary>

And now a defenseman!
 The draft keeps on rolling, and the Flyers have just made their third pick. In the fourth round, with the 110th overall pick, the Flyers have selected defenseman Brian Zanetti.
Round 4️⃣, Pick 1️⃣1️⃣0️⃣
We have selected defenseman Brian Zanetti! pic.twitter.com/XiuSxekKoK
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 24, 2021



Zanetti, a 6’2” left shot defenseman, spent this season playing with Lugano of the Swiss U20 league, and he was able to put up nine goals and 20 assists in 41 games played. He also captained Switzerland’s U18 team in this year’s tournament, where he also picked up two points in in eight games. 
A smooth skater and clean passer, Zanetti is a nice addition to the Flyers’ group of mobile, strong puck moving defensemen that they’re building up in the pipeline. Zanetti was supposed to play in Peterborough of the OHL this season, but with their season never getting rolling, he opted to stay in Switzerland. He did confirm to the media this afternoon that he plans to come over to play in Peterborough next season, though. 
Another fine pickup for the Flyers.]]></summary>

Another goalie enters the mix
 With their third round pick of the 2021 Draft, the Flyers have selected Belarusian goaltender Aleksei Kolosov.

— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 24, 2021



Kolosov, who was passed over in last year’s draft, spent much of this season with Dinamo Minsk of the KHL. While his usage there was a bit limited, he posted solid results as a teenager playing in a professional league. He only played in nine games, but he posted a .911 save percentage in those games. 
Though not the biggest player in terms of what we normally see in goaltenders (Kolosov is listed at 6’1” and 187 pounds), his skillset is undeniably an intriguing one. Kolosov brings very good quickness, and also generally good positioning on top of that. He’s economic in his movements, angles well, and flexes quite solid rebound control. There’s a definite calmness to his play, both in his ability to maintain control of his movements when he does have to move quickly, but also in how he rarely seems to get rattled when the game may not be going his way. 
Certainly there’s still a good bit of work that needs to be done to clean up and develop his game, but the Flyers seem willing to give him the time to develop, and are hoping to add a nice bit of organizational depth and further bolster their goaltender prospect pipeline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:
Starting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads through a web app people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games. […]
“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”
There’s a lot to roll your eyes at in this brief statement, but the big one is the last clause, implying that Apple’s stance on cloud gaming has anything at all to do with pushing people to buy the “latest and most expensive devices”. Say what you want about Apple’s App Store policies, they go to great lengths to keep older devices relevant for as long as possible — including with their own library of Apple Arcade games.
Will be interesting to see if these web app games are actually good, and if so, actually become popular.

Trades abound!
 The Flyers’ busy summer continues, and as we’re just settling into day 2 of the draft, the Flyers dropped another trade on us, and it’s a big one. 
The Flyers have announced that they’ve traded Jake Voracek to the Columbis Blue Jackets in exchange for Cam Atkinson. *Bob McKenzie voice* the trade is one for one. 
Atkinson is coming off of a respectable (if not a little down) season, which saw him post 15 goals and 19 assists, for 34 points in 56 games on a struggling Blue Jackets team. 
Cam Atkinson (traded to Philadelphia) is a good 5v5 play-driver, a little underwhelming on the power-play, finishing not great. pic.twitter.com/nRD6TV6J6a
— Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) July 24, 2021



There are a few different areas of interesting trade-offs that come with this trade. The Flyers lose a bit of the scoring game that they had with Voracek, but they gain a stronger play driver. Atkinson and Voracek are the same age, and while Atkinson is signed for four more years (one more than Voracek), his cap hit is just $5.875 million, so the Flyers do free up $2.375 million in cap space. 
And, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t also mention in the locker room implications of this move. There has been talk for a while about the mix with this Flyers team, in the locker room, not being right somehow, and the core being in need of a shake-up. And, well, moving out one of the team’s longest tenured players certainly achieves just that. 
What’s more, Atkinson was part of the leadership group in Columbus, and while it may not be fair to assume that he’ll immediately step into a similar role in Philadelphia, he remains a new voice with that leadership experience, and that hardly seems like a bad thing. 
It’s been a busy offseason, to be sure, and next season’s new look Flyers are continuing to evolve.]]></summary>

With their first pick of the 2021 NHL Draft, Philadelphia got a high-scoring Finnish forward
 With the 46th pick of the 2021 NHL Draft, the Philadelphia Flyers selected Samu Tuomaala, a right winger playing for Kärpät in the Finnish Liiga.

— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) July 24, 2021



Due to the acquisition of Rasmus Ristolainen — no matter how you feel about it — the Flyers took the night off on Friday and are making their first pick in the second round. In Tuomaala they got a fairly flashy player that was ranked anywhere from the top-20 to the middle of the second round by several scouting services.

He spent most of the season in the U20 junior league but got a total of five games playing in the top Finnish division, among men — so at least he has that experience and will most likely stay up there for longer next season.

— Spoked Z (@SpokedZ) July 16, 2021



For their first pick, it’s certainly a high-ceiling of a pick that could potentially pan out as a solid middle-six winger that can contribute on the powerplay. Given the fact that the Flyers have really tried to nail down those offensive players, selecting either Bobby Brink or Tyson Foerster with their top picks in recent years, in Tuomaala they got a similar projection of a player.
He skates fast and shoots the puck a lot. That’s the simple notion of his game.]]></summary>

I got gud
 I don’t consider myself a gamer — I’m just someone who quite likes playing video games. Apart from a Game Boy in the 1990s, the first console I owned was a Nintendo Switch that I bought in early 2018 to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I finally got around to buying a PlayStation 4 in the latter part of the same year. So it’s no surprise that when I first announced to a few experienced gamer friends and colleagues that I was going to play Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, most of them suggested I try another game first, or maybe not bother playing it at all.

There may not be much Flyers talk tonight, but there’s a draft still happening.
 Well, if you were hoping for the Flyers to do something on draft day, you got your wish, technically: The Flyers dealt their first-round pick (along with another second-round pick and defenseman Robert Hagg) to Buffalo for defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen earlier today. We’ll have more thoughts on that move in the coming days, weeks, and (gulp) months.
In the meantime, though, that move does mean that tonight is probably going to be a pretty uneventful night for the Flyers. Probably. Chuck Fletcher did suggest during today’s media availability that he’s probably not going to have any more moves coming today, and the Flyers, of course, no longer have their pick tonight.
Still, there are things happening around the league, and tonight might just be a big night around the league. If you’re here (and not at our draft party!), feel free to use this space to discuss the picks and whatever else happens around the league.
NHL Draft, Night 1:
Start Time: 8:00 p.m .ET
How to Watch: ESPN2 and the ESPN App
Flyers’ Draft Picks:
No. 45 (Round 2)
No. 77 (Round 3)
No. 109 (Round 4)
No. 157 (Round 5)
No. 173 (Round 6)
No. 205 (Round 7)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's iOS 15 website lists "improved recognition for individuals" as one of the new Photos features, and in a machine learning blog post shared this week, Apple gave more information on what exactly that means.





Apple says that on-device machine learning improvements have led to significantly better person recognition. The iOS 15 ‌Photos‌ app is able to detect people in extreme poses, people wearing accessories, and people with occluded faces.



To do this, Apple uses a combination of face and upper body to match people whose faces are not visible. Apple's machine learning blog says that the new functionality improves the ‌Photos‌ experience by identifying people in situations where it was previously impossible.



Apple's blog post on recognizing people in photos through on-device machine learning goes into much greater detail on how Apple uses machine learning to identify people while still protecting user privacy, and it's well worth a read for those who are interested in the inner workings of ML features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in March, Hyper released its HyperJuice Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack for the iPhone 12 lineup, promising customers an easy way to wirelessly charge their devices on the go. At the time, there were relatively few options for portable MagSafe-compatible battery packs on the market. Now, though, thanks to Apple's recent release of its own MagSafe Battery Pack, there is a little more competition, and Hyper's battery pack stacks up as a worthy competitor. 





Design


One of the most eye-catching aspects of the battery pack is its size. Like Apple's ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, Hyper sells one battery pack for all iPhone 12 models, meaning the size must be unawkwardly big enough for the iPhone 12 Pro Max but remain small enough to fit on an iPhone 12 mini.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Verizon today is discounting the Apple Pencil 2 to $103.99, down from $129.00. Although the Verizon website displays the accessory at a price of $109.99, once you head to checkout you'll see the $103.99 sale price applied automatically in your cart.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Verizon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



This sale is offering a second-best price for the Apple Pencil 2, and it's a match of the previous best price seen on the accessory earlier in 2021. We very rarely see the Apple Pencil 2 dip below this sale price, so if you've been on the hunt for one at a discount, now's a great time to buy.

Philadelphia got a guy from Buffalo.
 Everyone knew the Philadelphia Flyers were going to be active trying to fill holes on the blue line, but no one knew how quickly.
During the first few hours of the weekend of the 2021 NHL Draft, the Flyers have reportedly acquired right-handed defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen from the Buffalo Sabres for Robert Hagg, the 13th-overall pick in tonight’s draft, and a 2023 2nd-round pick.
Sounds like Rasmus Ristolainen is going to Philadelphia in a package deal that includes the Sabres getting the 13th pick in the draft.
— John Shannon (@JShannonhl) July 23, 2021



Ristolainen, 26, has been the anchor of the Sabres’ blue line for several years now, but has some of the worst numbers in the league while playing tough minutes. With just one year remaining on his contract that gives him a cap hit of $5.4-million, this is certainly swinging big and gambling on a decent improvement if he isn’t subject to the league’s best forwards coming at him. Who knows if that will even happen.
With Ristolainen’s contracts on their books, the Flyers now sit around $8.4 million to re-sign Carter Hart, Travis Sanheim and fill out the depths of their roster.
More to come.]]></summary>

RubberNinja plans to swallow more than 138,000 eggs on Twitch
 YouTuber Ross “RubberNinja” O’Donovan has spent the last few days guzzling eggs in Final Fantasy 14 as part of an elaborate “sub-athon” challenge on Twitch. With the help of voice and chat commands, he’s been able to eat more 35,000 eggs from his inventory, with many more to go as people subscribe to his channel.
The streamer started this endeavor, cheekily called “Eggwalker,” on July 20, and has no plans to stop until he runs out of eggs. As per his set of rules: Every 1,000 subscribers refills his inventory with 999 eggs and if he hits 20,000 subscribers total, he will have to shave his head to become an egg himself. O’Donovan himself must only eat meals that include eggs too. And when it…]]></summary>

Get three weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Convergence
3 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Vest, Plate, Vestment, chest armor
7 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle 
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

Plus, fan favorite guns The Comedian and The Hothead return as Nightfall weapons next season
 The conversation around Destiny 2’s disastrous Transmog system (aka Armor Synthesis) clouded the beginning of Season of the Splicer in early May, but Bungie is making a major improvement for next season.
Synthstrand — one of the three “Synth” currencies in Destiny 2’s overcomplicated Transmog system — will leave the game on Aug. 24, Bungie announced Thursday in its weekly blog. Synthstrand is one of the more controversial elements of the current system. Players currently need to generate 150 of them to buy Transmog bounties. However, days after the Transmog system went live, players discovered that Synthstrand is time-gated, meaning that players will only ever get one every …]]></summary>

Sometimes, I want companies to lighten up and put the “fun” in
“functionality.”
That bias contributes in some part to my interest in the
Playdate, a $179 portable gaming system that errs on the
side of childish, low-powered fun. I’ve spent three weeks
testing the system’s “near-final” hardware ahead of preorders
opening up on 1 pm ET on Thursday, July 29, and I can confirm
that it’s indeed fun to look at. Luckily, it’s also fun, simple,
and accessible to hold, play with, and share with every friend
that I can.
Andrew Webster at The Verge got an early look too, and had a similar reaction. I can’t wait for it — Playdate looks like it’s going to be such fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From a good roundup of security updates announced at WWDC last month, by Carly Page for TechCrunch:
To ensure iPhone users who don’t want to upgrade to iOS 15 straight away are up to date with security updates, Apple is going to start decoupling patches from feature updates. When iOS 15 lands later this year, users will be given the option to update to the latest version of iOS or to stick with iOS 14 and simply install the latest security fixes.
“iOS now offers a choice between two software update versions in the Settings app,” Apple explains (via MacRumors). “You can update to the latest version of iOS 15 as soon as it’s released for the latest features and most complete set of security updates. Or continue on  iOS 14  and still get important security updates until you’re ready to upgrade to the next major version.”
I missed this news last month, and misspoke about it on the latest episode of my podcast, while talking about holding onto iOS 14 indefinitely if Apple doesn’t sufficiently improve the design for Safari in iOS 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is developing an external display that includes an A13 chip with Neural Engine, according to a new rumor from 9to5Mac. The A13 chip with Neural Engine would presumably serve as an eGPU, though details are light at this time.





Having a CPU/GPU built into the external display could help Macs deliver high-resolution graphics without using all the resources of the computer's internal chip. Apple could also combine the power of the display SoC with the Mac's SoC to provide even more performance for running intensive graphic tasks.
There were rumors back in 2016 that suggested Apple was working on a new version of the Thunderbolt display that included a graphics card, but no such display ever materialized. In fact, no Apple-branded display came out ahead of the Pro Display XDR that was introduced in 2019, and the Pro Display XDR is just a display with no GPU included.



9to5Mac believes that the display with A13 chip would be a replacement for the Pro Display XDR, and it's possible that the release version of such a display would use an even more powerful chip than the A13 that was first introduced with the iPhone 11.



Apple is also rumored to be working on a more affordable external monitor that would be sold alongside the Pro Display XDR, but this more affordable monitor is apparently separate from the version with a built-in A-series chip.

Apple's ‌App Store‌ guidelines don't permit cloud-game-based apps to appear on the platform unless developers submit each app offered in the service individually for review. The limitation has been a significant point of contention between Apple and Facebook, and Microsoft, which both have cloud-game services. 



In a statement to The Verge, Facebook's vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, said that the company has come to the same conclusion as others, such as Microsoft, that bringing cloud games to iOS users through a web app is the only possible way. The vice pres…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-07-23T15:07:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, DigiTimes claimed that the upcoming iPad mini will feature a mini-LED display, but now, display analyst Ross Young is going at odds with that report, claiming that while the updated ‌iPad mini‌ continues to be on track for a release this year, it won't feature a mini-LED display.





Young says he "confirmed" with Radiant Opto-Electronics, who DigiTimes claims would provide Apple with the display, that the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ will not feature a mini-LED display. It's important to note that suppliers are tight-lipped about specific details about their client's work, especially suppliers working for Apple.



Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously stated that an updated iPad mini with a mini-LED display would launch in 2020, but likely due to the global health crisis and delays in production, that failed to materialize. The ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ rumor cycle has been rather cloudy, but some claims have pointed to a significant redesign featuring no home button, a Touch ID sensor embedded into the power button, a USB-C port, and a larger display. 



Rumors are also conflicting on whether the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ will feature Apple's current flagship A14 chip, included in the latest iPad Air and iPhone 12, or whether the iPad will use the A15 chip, destined for the upcoming iPhone 13. Rumors have also suggested that a "Pro" model of the ‌iPad mini‌ is also in the works; however, that doesn't seem to be likely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Woot today has Apple's MagSafe Charger in new condition for $29.99, down from $39.00. The previous best sale for the accessory was $29.85 at Amazon, so Woot's new discount is nearly a direct match for the all-time low price on the MagSafe Charger.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



The MagSafe Charger magnetically aligns with the magnets in the iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini. It's also compatible for wireless charging with iPhone models dating back to the iPhone 8. It has an attached USB-C cable, but it doesn't come with a 20W USB-C Power Adapter.




$9 OFF
MagSafe Charger for $29.99





This sale will only last today, and current shipping estimates put an estimated delivery for between July 30 and August 3. Amazon Prime members can use their membership to get free shipping from Woot as well, and the MagSafe Charger comes with a one year Apple limited warranty.

Square Enix’s MMO has the problem of being too popular
 Final Fantasy 14 has been shattered before, but not by its own players. Droves of new and returning players are flooding the MMO’s servers, resulting in lengthy queue times and even a brief period where the digital version of the game went out of stock.
This leap in popularity is both unprecedented and unexpected. It’s abnormal for an MMO to see a spike in players during the lull between the last major content patch and the upcoming expansion. (For Final Fantasy 14, that’s the highly anticipated Endwalker.) Usually, this is when players fizzle out, take breaks, or swap to another MMO. It turns out, this is precisely what’s happening, but in the other direction: Disillusioned World of Warcraft fans are makin…]]></summary>
