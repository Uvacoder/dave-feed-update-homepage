        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josh Centers, writing at TidBITS:
We’re all eagerly awaiting iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS 12 Monterey,
and watchOS 8, but will they run on the devices you have now?
Apple continues to do an excellent job of supporting old devices,
but many iPhone and iPad features will require at least an A12
Bionic chip. On the Mac side, some of the new features require an
M1 processor.
Overall, maintaining support for old devices while restricting
certain new features to more capable recent models is a great
strategy. That way, fewer people are forced to buy new hardware
just to participate, but the new features encourage hardware
upgrades for those who want to take advantage of them.
It’s a testimony to Apple’s commitment to device longevity that iOS 15 will run on A9-based iPhones (2015’s iPhone 6S and 2016’s original iPhone SE). Of course they don’t get all the new features. The Android world is nothing like this.
Centers’s article is a detailed rundown of which devices get which features that were announced at WWDC two weeks ago.

Chances are, you and your customers have struggled with formatting data in Excel, mapping CSV headers, or correcting invalid fields.
​​
This process of importing B2B data is known as data onboarding. And it’s been isolated from innovation.

Flatfile, the data onboarding platform, intuitively makes sense of the jumbled data your users import, and transforms it into the format you rely on.

No touchy CSV templates. No building a clunky data importer. No expensive implementation teams hired to migrate data.

I don’t think it is an accident that these bills were presented as

to view the package as one bill. It seems to me that Chairman
Cicilline has played his cards very deftly here: start with the
fact that while every bill was authored by a Democrat, they all
have a Republican co-sponsor; if some combination of these
regulations pass they will likely be with overwhelmingly
Democratic support, but the fact they are starting out as
nominally bi-partisan efforts is savvy.

A revenant, a time traveler, and a chonky sand monster walk into a bar...
 Legends of Runeterra, the card game set in the greater League of Legends universe, will feel quite different soon. On June 30, Riot will release Rise of the Underworlds, a new expansion with 40 cards. The patch also aims to make tons of balance changes to shake up the meta-game.
Rise of the Underworlds come with three new champions: the undead pirate Pyke, time-traveler punk Ekko, and monster queen Rek’sai. These playable characters in League of Legends make for powerful cards in Legends of Runeterra, and they are often the central point of several possible deck combinations.
The set also comes with a new keyword: Lurk, which powers up lurker enemies. Lurker enemies thrive when they’re at the top of your deck. When they’re in that position, and you attack your enemy, every Lurker ally in your deck gets +1 damage.

In terms of lore, the new cards will help round out the settings of Zaun, Shurima, and Bilgewater. Supporting cards from Legends of Runeterra can end up playing important roles in the longterm story of the setting.
Legends of Runeterra is a free-to-play game available on iOS, Android, and Windows PC. Riot will be revealing one new card from the set every day on strategy site Mobalytics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clinton Jones challenged his community of 3D artists to interpret a simple animation of a person walking with a heavy load. 2400 people participated and Jones collected the 100 renders for this video. What a fantastic illustration of the power of constraints and the abundance of human creativity. Ok, much of the imagery is borrowed from Star Wars and other sci-fi universes, but the stuff that isn’t is delightful. Even with no explicit narrative connection between the scenes, somehow this all seems like part of one big journey. One of the simplest stories we tell is someone moving from one place to another and it doesn’t need to be The Odyssey, Fury Road, or Thelma & Louise to be compelling.
You can also watch a video featuring all 2400 entries (it’s 2h 45m long) and a montage from a previous challenge featuring 125 artists.

A slice-of-life RPG set in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism
 A lot of flashy and exciting games got announced during E3 earlier this month. A second trailer (and release date) for Elden Ring! Bethesda’s Starfield! Arkane’s Redfall!

Developed by Gareth Damian Martin, aka Jump Over The Age, Citizen Sleeper is a slice-of-life narrative RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games. Set on a derelict space station named Erlin’s Eye, Citizen Sleeper’s cast consists of a ragtag group of outcasts, hackers, mercenaries, and everyday folks try…]]></summary>

Battle your way through Icewind Dale
 Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance lets up to four players take on classic roles to battle through enemy armies. It’s a pretty straightforward hack-and-slash adventure, but there’s still advice we wish we had starting out.
In this Dark Alliance beginner’s guide, we’ll give you our seven best tips for your adventure through Icewind Dale.
Playing with friends unlocks new moves
Playing D&D: Dark Alliance solo is a hack-and-slash adventure without a lot of subtlety. Playing with friends is a little different. Pulling off certain moves like parrying or backstabs will trigger Team Attacks. These attacks make managing your enemies much easier and make those moves a lot more meaningful.
Characters are classes

Should the Flyers be pursuing the Minnesota defenseman?
 It appears that Dougie Hamilton, the headliner of the 2021 free-agent market, is not the Flyers’ top priority.
In the latest edition of 31 Thoughts, Elliotte Friedman reports that the Flyers’ defensive targets seem to be elsewhere. He later expands on this point:
15. Philadelphia’s got a lot of balls in the air. I figured they’d be in on Hamilton, but, as mentioned above, he doesn’t appears to be their top target. I’m speculating here, but my guesses would include Seth Jones and Matt Dumba (who GM Chuck Fletcher knows very well). It also wouldn’t be a shocker if they have asked the Coyotes about 2019 first-rounder Victor Soderstrom. The Flyers liked him at that draft, and Arizon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite previous attempts to put the situation at rest, some iCloud users continue to experience spam calendar invitations, causing their calendars to be filled with random events.





The situation received widespread coverage in 2016, where Apple said that it was "actively working to address this issue" by "identifying and blocking suspicious senders." Victims are targeted in various ways. The most common method is by receiving a normal iCloud calendar invitation through their calendar app. 



Interacting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing "Maybe," lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.



Other users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a video posted by Apple Support, that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. 



The video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. 








One measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation. By redirecting invitations to their email, users can better manage and delete calendar invitations. For more detailed instructions, make sure to check out our how to.

Among the recipients in 2021 was CARROT Weather, a popular app known for its humorous weather forecasts.





CARROT Weather has since shared an unboxing video of its Apple Design Award with a similarly humorous tone, offering a closer look at the aluminum cube.



The quirky weather app was a winner in the "Interaction" category alongside Bird Alone. Apple said winners in this category "deliver intuitive interfaces and effortless controls that are perfectly tailored to their platform."






"CARROT Weather is known for its humorous forecasts and unique visuals," said Apple. "A recent design update has brought simplicity and elegance to its experience across all Apple platforms. From witty weather projections, to a robust set of customizable widgets and a collection of useful watch faces, this app comes packed with endless entertainment."

And it turns out, astronomers are about to witness the closest pass of this incredible round trip. Currently, 2014 UN271 is about 22 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun (for reference, Earth is 1 AU from the Sun). That means it’s already closer than Neptune, at 29.7 AU. And it’s not stopping there — it’s already traveled 7 AU in the last seven years, and at its closest in 2031, it’s expected to pass within 10.9 AU of the Sun, almost reaching the orbit of Saturn.
Before then, it’s expected to develop the characteristic coma and tail of a comet, as icy material on its surface vaporizes from the heat of the Sun. This close pass would give astronomers an unprecedented close look at Oort cloud objects.


C’mon NASA, let’s a get a probe fired up and visit this very unusual object!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Macintosh 128K fan has created a fun video that re-imagines the original Mac from 1984 in a modern-style advert.






The project comes from motion designer Thibaut Crepelle, who outlined the creative process behind the video in a Behance post.



I wanted to pursue my idea of creating modern motion design stuff for vintage products. 

For this piece, since everything is a learning experiment, I wanted to tackle a bit of UI and "animated modeling."



Today, its cubic design, its cute launch icon are elements well established in the computer horizon, and I wanted to pay an homage to that classic piece of hardware.








The Macintosh 128K was introduced in the now-famous "1984" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott, but Crepelle sought to match the vibrant, punchy Apple ads of today using a range of software and resources from Figma to replicate the classic Mac's UI and high-resolution animations that synchronized with the music.



Crepelle also included a number of easter eggs in the video, such as macOS Monterey's wallpaper and the gradient used on Apple's "One More Thing" Mac event graphics.

The Xbox creator has built up a diverse gaming lineup
 In Microsoft’s E3 2021 presentation last week, the Xbox maker finally revealed the fruits of its five-year plan to forge an empire. The company’s higher-ups have spent years building to this future, quietly toiling away at acquisitions and refining the Xbox platform while competitor Sony flashed its major cinematic games, like God of War and Spider-Man. Now, Microsoft has something to show for those seemingly slow years. 
Based on the Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, there appears to be no one “type” of gamer that the company is targeting, with games both big and small in the mix. Then there’s the temptation of a good deal with Xbox Game Pass, and ease of access via Xbox Cloud Gaming. But th…]]></summary>

We are no longer feeling the shake.
 A mark of greatness is a memorable gimmick, something that sticks in the minds of fans generations after the story of a team has come to a close. Remarkable periods of success are best enjoyed when there’s a certain moment, playoff run, or player that remains iconic even as time passes and the luster of a franchise is eroded by mismanagement and failure. These are the gems of the past that we, as Flyers fans, cling to; occurrences that gave us hope, that compel us to root for this infuriating product year in and year out.

The survey asked 3,000 iPhone and iPad users, evenly split between men and women, aged 18 or over in the United States, what they thought of ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, and the naming of the upcoming iPhone 13 lineup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following widespread reports that the iPhone 12 mini has experienced poor sales performance, at least relative to other iPhone 12 models, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce today claimed that production of the device has already ended.





According to TrendForce, the iPhone 12 mini "reached End-of-Life ahead of time" during the second quarter of 2021, suggesting that Apple will focus on selling through its existing inventory of the device without producing any further units. Launched in October 2020, the iPhone 12 mini features a 5.4-inch display that caters to fans of smaller smartphones, with pricing starting at $699 in the United States.



While production has reportedly ceased, the iPhone 12 mini remains available on Apple.com without any notable shipping delays for now. The device is offered in six colors, including a purple option that went on sale in late April.



Apple is still expected to unveil an iPhone 13 mini later this year, but rumors suggest the 5.4-inch model will be discontinued in 2022.

We’ve got a goalie in the mix, folks!
 At long last! We’re closing out the top-10 and we finally have a goaltender entering the draft board mix. 
Jesper Wallstedt had, in short, a pretty stellar season. At just 18 years old, he made a full time debut with Luleå of the SHL, and was really well able to hit the ground running. His team finished 5th in the SHL on the season with a loss in the quarterfinals, and Wallstedt was a key piece in that success. It was just about an even split of the workload for the goalies, with Wallstedt playing in 22 of their 52 games, and not looking even a bit out of place in his role. It’s really hard to overstate how huge that is for a player of his age, and that leaves us with a lot to be excited about with regard…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple will likely unveil its next-generation "iPhone 12s" or "iPhone 13" lineup in around two and a half months from now, and ahead of time, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce has outlined its expectations for the devices.





A summary of TrendForce's expectations:
Apple will unveil four new iPhones in September, including a mini model, a standard model, and two Pro models. September is the usual month for Apple to unveil new iPhones, but the iPhone 12 lineup was announced in October last year due to reported COVID-19-related production delays.


The new iPhones will have a smaller notch above the display, but will otherwise have a similar outward design as iPhone 12 models.


The devices will be powered by Apple's next-generation A15 chip manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm+ process.


All four iPhones will be equipped with OLED displays, while the two Pro models will also feature a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother content.


The new iPhones will have the same storage capacity options as their iPhone 12 counterparts. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models are available with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, while 12 Pro models have a 512GB option.


The rear camera system on all four iPhones will be equipped with sensor-shift image stabilization, a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. For the new Pro models, the Ultra Wide lens will gain autofocus.


The LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the Pro models.
With the pandemic showing signs of easing in the United States and Europe, TrendForce forecasted that annual iPhone production for 2021 will grow by around 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to 223 million units. The research firm believes the "iPhone 12s" lineup will account for nearly 40% of that total production volume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a TEDx Talk from 2017, LB Hannahs talks about their experience as a transgender dad, comfort vs authenticity, and the collision of theoretical gender roles & identities with the practicalities of parenthood.
Now, for most people, what their child will call them is not something that they give much thought to outside of culturally specific words or variations on a gendered theme like “mama,” “mommy,” or “daddy,” “papa.” But for me, the possibility is what this child, who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult, will call me for the rest of our lives, was both extremely scary and exciting. And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called “mama” or something like it didn’t feel like me at all. And no matter how many times or versions of “mom” I tried, it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable. I knew being called “mom” or “mommy” would be easier to digest for most people. The idea of having two moms is not super novel, especially where we live. 
So I tried other words. And when I played around with “daddy,” it felt better. Better, but not perfect. It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in. And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called “daddy” was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments. But, before I knew it, the time had come and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do, and my new identity as a parent began. I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 So we all agree that no sporting event happened in Philadelphia last night, right? Right. Anywho, onto the links.
*Ryan Pulock played hero for the Islanders in one of the crazier playoff moments you’ll find, given the circumstances in both the game and the series. (Sportsnet)
*So you want to fix the Flyers. What’s step one? (BSH)
*Is OEL a part of that solution? Oliver Ekman-Larsson has his detractors, but he’s yet another defenseman to keep an eye on as the Flyers’ quest to replace Matt Niskanen continues. (Philly Hockey Now)
*Perhaps Dougie Hamilton isn’t the Flyers’ main target, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a target. His impact would be massive. Charlie breaks it all down. (The Athletic)
*Two weeks back the Trois-Rivières Lions unveiled their gorgeous logo, sparking some conversation about the best hockey logos outside the NHL. (The Hockey News)
*Something that I’m sure many of us don’t want to think about is how Sean Couturier is set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of next season. There’s always some added fuel in a contract year. (NBC Sports Philly)
*Advertisements on jerseys? They may be on their way. Eek. (The Athletic)
*Our draft board continues with Finnish center, Aatu Räty. We’re inching closer and closer to the Flyers’ territory. That is, if they actually keep their pick. (BSH)
*Finally, Robin Lehner showed up in a big way for the Golden Knights in their series-evening victory last night. Of course, not without reading all of your mean tweets beforehand. (ESPN)]]></summary>

The proceeding against Apple announced today will determine whether the Cupertino tech giant holds a "paramount significance across markets" and whether, through its ecosystem, Apple holds enough power to make it difficult for "other companies" to challenge it.

Russian lawmakers passed legislation last week that requires foreign sites with more than half a million daily users in Russia to set up a local branch or Russian legal entity, reports Reuters:

Websites that do not comply would be marked as being non-compliant on search engines, they could be excluded from search engine results, and banned from advertising in Russia and for Russians, the parliament said on its website.
The bill's authors argue that the current lack of such a requirement allows foreign sites to formally remain outside of Russia's jurisdiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Rayburn, writing for Streaming Media Blog:
On Monday, Apple announced some new privacy features in iCloud,
one of which they are calling Private Relay. The way it works is
that when you go to a website using Safari, iCloud Private Relay
takes your IP address to connect you to the website and then
encrypts the URL so that app developers, and even Apple, don’t
know what website you are visiting. The IP and encrypted URL then
travels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a
“trusted partner”. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple
would not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,
based on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on
the right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.
It’s a little weird that Apple doesn’t want to talk about who these “trusted partners” are, because if we don’t know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them? Putting your name on a product or service is a badge of trust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in iOS that effectively disables an iPhone's ability to connect to Wi-Fi.





Security researcher Carl Schou found that after joining a Wi-Fi network with the name "%p%s%s%s%s%n" his ‌iPhone‌'s Wi-Fi functionality was left "permanently disabled." 



Changing a hotspot's SSID did nothing to correct the problem, with even a reboot failing to make a difference, according to BleepingComputer. 



Other users who were able to replicate the issue have suggested the bug could be related to the initial use in the network name of the percentage sign, which leads to an input parsing issue whereby iOS mistakenly interprets the letters following the "%" as a string-format specifier.




After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID “%p%s%s%s%s%n”, my ‌iPhone‌ permanently disabled it’s WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~) pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3
— Carl Schou (@vm_call) June 18, 2021
 


In C and C-style languages, string format specifiers have a special meaning and are parsed by the language compiler as a variable name or a command instead of standard text.



Android phones don't seem to be affected by the same network, but iPhones hit by the problem need to have their network settings reset before a Wi-Fi hotspot can be connected again.



To perform the reset, open the Settings app, tap General -> Reset, then tap Reset Network Settings and confirm the request at the prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fox Now app has removed support for the third-generation Apple TV, with the app now only compatible with fourth-generation and later models of Apple's set-top box.





Existing installs of Fox Now on third-gen Apple TVs no longer work, and the app has been removed from home screens, preventing users on the older hardware from accessing Fox live and on-demand content like TV shows and sports.



First spotted by Appleosophy, the change follows a Fox Now announcement in May that it would no longer support the third-gen box from June 17. Similar moves to drop third-gen support have been made by other streaming apps this year, including YouTube and CBS All Access.



While native third-gen ‌Apple TV‌ support has dropped, the Fox Now app is still available on iPhone and iPad, which means anyone with one of these iOS devices can still AirPlay Fox Now content to their ‌Apple TV‌ for watching, albeit indirectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with Ampere to offer MacRumors readers a chance to win a pair of Dusk sunglasses. The Dusk sunglasses aren't your standard pair of sunglasses -- they have adjustable electrochromic lenses.






You can use an accompanying app or a control on the sunglasses themselves to adjust the tint level, plus these are smart sunglasses with integrated speaker and microphone so you can also listen to music and take phone calls. 





Like many sunglasses that play music, the Dusk sunglasses use an open ear audio feature that lets you listen to music without disturbing those around you. The built-in battery gives you four hours of playtime before needing to be recharged, but it lasts for seven days when you're just using tint control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, the Photos app has been given a significant update that includes a richer Info pane to view information about a photo in your library, such as the camera, lens, and shutter speed used, the file size of the image, and where the image came from if it was saved from within another app. 





In another notable addition, you can also edit the date and time when a photo was taken. Here's how it's done in the latest ‌‌iOS 15‌‌ developer beta, a version of which will be available to the public in July.


Launch the Photos app and tap a photo to select it.


Tap the info button (the encircled "i" icon) below the image.


Tap Adjust next to the date and time.


Use the calendar and the time dial to choose a new date and time, then tap Done.


Elsewhere in ‌Photos‌, ‌iOS 15‌ features a considerable update to Photo Memories, which now feature a new design, integration with Apple Music, a more interactive interface, and more intelligent memory types, such as improved pet memories, including the ability to recognize individual dogs and cats.



For more information on ‌iOS 15‌, check out our dedicated roundup. Apple will make ‌‌iOS 15‌‌ available for general release this fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long wait, YouTube for iOS is officially gaining picture-in-picture support, allowing all users, non-premium and premium subscribers, to close the YouTube app and continue watching their video in a small pop-up window.





In a statement to MacRumors, YouTube says that picture-in-picture is currently rolling out to all premium subscribers on iOS and that a larger rollout to all US iOS users will take place soon. It's worth noting, again, that this feature will be available to all users, despite some speculation that YouTube may have limited picture-in-picture support for only paying subscribers.

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows users to watch YouTube videos in a small mini player while simultaneously browsing outside of the YouTube app on their mobile device. We’re starting to roll out PiP for YouTube Premium members on iOS and plan to launch PiP for all US iOS users as well.
YouTube picture-in-picture has been a constant back and forth game, with it sometimes working via the YouTube website on Safari. Some users have found creative workarounds utilizing Shortcuts to turn off built-in parameters on the YouTube site that disables picture-in-picture. Now, though, with official support rolling out and soon to be more widespread, those workarounds will no longer be needed.

Last month, Apple listed the Space Gray accessories as available while supplies last, and the company has now removed the product pages from its website entirely, as spotted by Appleosophy. The accessories remain available in Silver, but keep in mind they have not been updated since October 2015.



The new iMac with the M1 chip is available with colorful new Magic accessories, including a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, but Apple has not yet made these accessories available for purchase on a standalone basis.

The HomePod mini is a smaller version of the HomePod, measuring in at 3.3 inches tall compared to the HomePod's 6.8-inch height.

The only other notable deal for HomePod mini we've tracked in 2021 was a $10 sale at Expercom. Given the low entry price of the smart speaker, steep discounts have been rare, and will likely continue to be as we move into the rest of the year.

Räty’s name has been on the scouting communities mind for a few years now — and at one point even looked like sure-fire top-five pick just a few seasons ago, with mentions along the likes of his Finnish countrymen Mikko Rantanen and Aleksander Barkov depending on who you talked to.

Trade for Eichel! Do it! 
 The Flyers have similar needs to last year this offseason. In fact, they have the same needs this offseason as the last.
Despite the similarities, the main difference as the Flyers approach free agency this season is the shift in attitude. After the Flyers’ success during the end of the 2019-20 season in the Toronto bubble (for lack of a better term, we can consider winning a playoff series a success), the team and front office staff had every right to feel confident with the group at hand, and thus, major moves were not a focus that offseason. However, a disappointing 2020-21 campaign exposed the flaws in the Flyers’ handling of their key weaknesses, and the optimism present a year ago no longer exists as bois…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple supplier TSMC is preparing to produce 3nm chips in the second half of 2022, and in the coming months, the supplier will begin production of 4nm chips, according to a new report from DigiTimes. 





Apple had previously booked the initial capacity of TSMC's 4nm chip production for future Macs and more recently ordered TSMC to begin production of the A15 chip for the upcoming iPhone 13, based on an enhanced 5nm process. 



Today's report outlines a more long-term plan for TSMC, stating that the new 3nm chip process will offer 15% performance boost alongside 30% improved energy efficiency and will enter mass production late next year. 

TSMC has claimed its N3 technology will be the world's most advanced technology when it begins volume production in the second half of 2022. Relying on the proven FinFET transistor architecture for the best performance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness, N3 will offer up to 15% speed gain or consume up to 30% less power than N5, and provide up to 70% logic density gain.
While the report doesn't offer any detail of how the new 3nm chip can be implemented into Apple products, it's safe to assume its still years away. Apple's 14 chip, currently in the iPhone 12 series and iPad Air, is based on the 5nm process. The M1 Apple silicon also shares the same 5nm architecture.



The smaller process provides improved performance and energy efficiency and offer more freedom with product design, thanks to their smaller overall footprint.

Even platforming masters aren’t immune 
 Trolls are the most recognizable element of ultra-hard Mario hacks and levels, known as kaizo. A simple, unexpected obstacle is not only funny but also creates that special sauce that makes kaizo so fun to watch. But not all trolls are created equally, and many creators use different interpretations of the concept to subvert players’ expectations.
A subgenre under the broader umbrella of ROM hacking, kaizo hacks emphasize precision and mastery in a way that’s much more difficult than normal Mario platformers. These user-created games are also are known for containing an abundance of trolls. Some particularly devilish or clever levels are even designed to exploit the player’s knowledge of the genre and its conventions. Here a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has released updates for iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor, introducing a handful of new features such as enhanced media search and notifications for encoding batches, as well as bug fixes.





iMovie 10.2.4 brings sixteen new solid and textured backgrounds with adjustable colors, the ability to import projects created with iMovie for iOS (version 2.3), and general stability improvements. 



Final Cut Pro 10.5.3 allows users to create and save custom column arrangements in the browser, and edit them with the Column Set Editor.

        <id>https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/intel-market-share-falling-apple-silicon/</id>
        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/intel-market-share-falling-apple-silicon/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-18T09:06:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.





Apple announced last year that it would embark on a two-year-long journey to transition all of its Mac computers, both desktops, and laptops, to use its own in-house processors. Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, M1. 



As a result of the four Macs with ‌M1‌ and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.

However, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.



Intel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.
Intel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs. Bloomberg reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as 32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics for future Mac releases.

Players have until Saturday afternoon to claim it
 GOG.com has a free game available for the next two days, and it’s a pretty good one: Absolute Drift: Zen Edition, by Funselektor, whose follow-up Art of Rally launched in September.
Absolute Drift, for Windows PC is a series of drifting/gymkhana challenges raced from a stylized, top-down perspective, somewhat resembling a Micro Machines racing game. Absolute Drift launched on Windows in 2015, and then on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in August of 2017. It launched at the beginning of 2021 for Nintendo Switch, too. Absolute Drift is ordinarily $11.99; it has a “Very Positive” user rating on Steam.
We were enamored of Funselektor’s Art of Rally, which is a different type of racing but has similar stylish visuals. This video gives a better idea of what Absolute Drift entails.


Players have until Saturday afternoon to claim Absolute Drift. All they need is a free GOG.com account and to opt-in to CD Projekt’s marketing notices.]]></summary>

Rare reveals new gameplay of Pirates of the Caribbean expansion
 Sea of Thieves developer Rare dropped a big surprise on Sunday during E3 2021’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase: Captain Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones are coming to the silly seafaring game in a new, Pirates of the Caribbean-themed adventure called Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life. On Thursday, Rare gave fans another look at that forthcoming content with a new gameplay trailer.
The new trailer shows off more of the new story, spooky new areas, new enemies, and new cosmetics — yes, you and your crew will be able to dress up like Jack Sparrow — coming in Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life when it launches June 22 as a free update. The gameplay trailer also apparently reveals that players will come face to face, literally, with the game’s Kraken.
Sea of Thieves is available on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and is included as part of a Xbox Game Pass subscription.]]></summary>

Senua’s Saga sounds still very early in development
 Ninja Theory’s sequel to Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t make an appearance at Microsoft’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase at E3 2021 for what sounds like a very good reason: The game, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, appears to still be quite early in development, based on a new update from the developer.
Tameem Antoniades, “chief creative ninja” at Ninja Theory, said in a development update Thursday that the Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 team is currently “building a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest.”
Antoniades said that Ninja Theory “didn’t want to do a straight sequel — we wanted to do something extra special, and so we’re making our lives as difficult as possible in that pursuit.”
Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 will be set in ninth-century Iceland, Antoniades said, and to properly capture that setting, Ninja Theory has sent its “art and audio teams out there doing photography, photogrammetry, and combining it with satellite data to recreate large swathes of the landscape.”
“On the character front, we’re building real costumes [and] scanning them in,” Antoniades said. “We’re collaborating with Epic Games to bring you next-generation digital characters, [and] on the combat front, we want it to be extra real and brutal, so Melina [Juergens], our main actress, has been training for two years, and all of our animators have undergone combat training.”
Antoniades’ update concluded with “not a trailer, not a gameplay reveal, but montage of the kind of work we’ve been up to.”
Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 was first announced in December 2019, at The Game Awards, as one of the first Xbox Series X games. The original Hellblade was released in 2017, and was praised for its narrative structure as well as the performance of Melina Juergens. That game told the story of Senua, a Pict warrior who travels to the Norse plane of Helheim.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.



Live Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an M1 Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.



Other updates include WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.



The new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both macOS Big Sur and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.



The ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website.



Apple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

Destiny’s story is about to get (more) complicated
 A new update in Destiny 2 suggests that Savathun, the titular Witch Queen in the game’s upcoming expansion and sister to Oryx, has taken human form in the Last City. And fans are freaking out.
As Destiny 2’s story has improved, players have gotten even more ravenous for details on upcoming story beats and expansions. So far, Season of the Splicer has told a mostly contained story about prejudice and refugees. But players discovered a new lore page on Tuesday that really escalated the threat in this Destiny 2 season, potentially setting up story beats for the upcoming expansion.

C’mon, EA! It was a favorite play for Madden himself!
 Madden NFL 22 is launching with a lot of new features, including new layers to the Franchise mode that should deepen an experience hardcore fans have felt was neglected. But it will not, for the 30th consecutive year, include the fair catch kick. Curses! Drat!
“I was hoping for that question,” said gameplay producer Clint Oldenburg, who has come to expect it from me every year. “No, it’s not going to be in [Madden NFL] 22, but I do ask [at developers’ meetings] every year, and I say this: ‘The fair catch kick is worth at least one Metacritic poin…]]></summary>

Norway you should miss out on this Swede new update
 Microsoft Flight Simulator’s virtual world is getting a gorgeous new update, making the game’s Nordic region more beautiful than ever. World Update 5: Nordics for Asobo Studio’s flight sim gives some love and attention to landmarks and airports across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The update is free and available now.
Microsoft says that World Update 5 includes improvements in detail to “broad swaths of landscapes, enhancements to regional architecture, improved data for 100 airports and 78 carefully selected points of interest.” As seen in the gameplay trailer above, those points of interest include Lego House, Frederiksborg Castle, and the city of Copenhagen in Denmark; Uddevalla Bridge, Avicii Arena, and Sarek National Park in Sweden; Olavinlinna and the city of Helsinki in Finland; Flakstad, the Arctic Cathedral, and Holmenkollbakken in Norway; and Hallgrímskirkja, Jökulsárlón, and Hvítserkur in Iceland. Not shown: how much I’d really like to visit any of those places in real life right now.


Local airports — Denmark’s Bornholm, Iceland’s Ísafjörður, Sweden’s Stockholm Arlanda, Norway’s Svalbard, and Finland’s Vaasa — have all been “carefully replicated by hand for maximum realism,” Asobo Studio said in a post on the Microsoft Flight Simulator website, which names every new point of interest. The update also includes localization in Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish.
Microsoft Flight Simulator is available now on Windows PC and is coming to Xbox Series X on July 27. A Top Gun-themed expansion for the game is planned for later this year.]]></summary>

The site Star Trek + Design is collecting the futuristic design objects — chairs, cups, silverware, sofas — that designers used on the sets of Star Trek movies and TV shows to depict the future.
Being drawn to the aesthetics of Trek, especially of The Next Generation, made me curious about the specific objects that set designers used to create the visual embodiment of what living and working on a starship would look like in a technologically-advanced, post-scarcity future.


For instance, this is an RBT Chair by Teknion used in Star Trek: Discovery:

Park Avenue glasses made by Anchor Hocking were used for barware in TNG:

Voyager used Arne Jacobsen’s AJ Flatware in several episodes (as did Kubrick’s 2001):

In these draft talks, Owen Power and Matty Beniers have been getting a lot of love, deservedly, but they have another teammate who’s eligible for this draft and probably deserves to have a bit more hype himself. 
Kent Johnson had, in short, a really stellar freshman season with Michigan. He finished the season 12th in scoring in the conference, and second among freshman, behind teammate Thomas Bordeleau. It took a bit of time to adjust, but he was a real impact player for the Wolverines this season, and pretty quickly asserted himself as one of the most dynamic playmakers on an already …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared a teaser trailer for "The Shrink Next Door," an eight-episode limited comedy series starring and executive produced by Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd. The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to Apple's announcement.






Based on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says "The Shrink Next Door" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac "Ike" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin "Marty" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.
Over the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.
The project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since "Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues" in 2013.



In other ‌Apple TV+‌ news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of "Truth Be Told," an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer. The series is set to return August 20, with new episodes released every Friday.






In season two, investigative reporter turned true crime podcaster Poppy Parnell (played by Spencer) dives into a new case that deeply involves her childhood friend turned media mogul Micah Keith (played by Kate Hudson).

Meet KAY/O
 Valorant’s newest Agent is a robot named KAY/O with the power to suppress his enemies’ abilities. The new Agent will be part of Valorant’s Episode 3 update, which should also include a fairly large patch for the game.
KAY/O is an Initiator, which means he’ll be great at pushing his way onto sites and breaking through enemy defenses. One of KAY/O’s abilities allows him to throw a special knife that prevents enemies in a small area from using their abilities — an effect called suppressed. His Ultimate includes something similar but radiates out from his body. KAY/O’s Ultimate also gives him a Combat Stim when he uses it, and if he dies during the Ultimate he’ll have the chance to be revived by a teammate.

        <updated>2021-06-17T14:33:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today lowered the prices of AppleCare+ plans for MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models equipped with the M1 chip. Coverage offered by the plans, as well as accidental damage fees, appear to remain unchanged.





In the United States, AppleCare+ for the MacBook Air now costs $199, down from $249. The new price applies to both M1 and Intel-based MacBook Air models, although Apple no longer sells the Intel-based model directly.



For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has split AppleCare+ into two separate plans for the M1 and Intel-based models, with pricing for the M1 model lowered to $249, down from $269. Notably, the price of AppleCare+ for the Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pro remains $269, so customers opting for the Apple silicon model now receive a slight discount.



The new lower prices are also available in other countries we've checked, such as Canada, with discounts varying based on the local currency.



Customers who recently purchased AppleCare+ for one of the affected MacBook models can contact Apple Support for assistance with cancelling their current AppleCare+ plan and purchasing a new one at the lower price, according to information obtained by MacRumors, but Apple did not provide a cutoff date for eligibility.



AppleCare+ for Mac provides up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other damage. AppleCare+ also provides 24/7 priority access to Apple's technical support representatives by online chat or phone.

Patch 1.23 is another bug squasher
 Developer CD Projekt Red rolled out a new patch for Cyberpunk 2077 on Thursday, patch 1.23, that squashes more bugs and fixes a variety of quest-related issues in the first-person shooter. The patch arrives just days before Cyberpunk 2077 is set to return to Sony’s PlayStation Store, after a six-month absence.
Console players will therefore be pleased to read that patch 1.23 for Cyberpunk 2077 promises “numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems” and “various console CPU optimizations,” according to CD Projekt Red’s patch notes. The developer says the update will reduce the number of overall crashes.
Elsewhere, the patch appears to primarily address quest and open-world bugs, a list of which…]]></summary>

 It was a preseason game, Clint Oldenburg said. “Not a regular season game, not a playoff game.” The crowd in Seattle still annihilated his ability to think.
“When I was at the line of scrimmage, I couldn’t hear anything. All I could hear was the crowd,” said Oldenburg, today Madden NFL 22’s gameplay producer, back then an offensive lineman trying to make the Denver Broncos’ 53-man roster. 
Yes, home-field advantage is real, Oldenburg said. With crowds returning after a pandemic year quieted the NFL’s stadiums last fall, they’ll be a more noticeable part of the league’s video game, too. But a home field’s challenge won’t simply be in ramped-up volu…]]></summary>

 The Flyers are on the hunt for an impactful star player, one who can become the centerpiece of this upcoming generation after the former crown jewels (Nolan Patrick, Ivan Provorov, and Carter Hart) all regressed this past year. In particular, the team has reason for concern at forward. Outside of single season performances from Travis Konecny, Oskar Lindblom, and Joel Farabee, the Orange & Black are devoid of young talent up front that looks remotely capable of supplanting the aging star trio of Giroux, Voracek, and Couturier. Recent reports have put the Flyers in play for Jack Eichel, but his enormous contract and coveted status across the league will likely impose a heavy toll on …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has today announced that it is awarding "innovation grants" worth five million dollars to four historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), as reported by USA Today.





Alabama A&M University, Howard University, Morgan State University, and Prairie View A&M University will receive the grants as part of Apple's wider $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative that was announced earlier this year.



The grants, set to be issued over a three-year period, are part of Apple's New Silicon Initiative. The scheme is intended to help students prepare for careers in hardware technology and chip design. The grants will support each university's engineering school and help expand emerging hardware technology courses. Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said in a statement: 
The HBCU community is home to incredible Black talent and we are thrilled to work alongside these universities to enhance the opportunities for their students. We know many jobs of the future will be in innovative areas like silicon engineering and we want to help ensure the leaders of tomorrow have access to transformational learning opportunities.
 The "innovation grants" will also include select scholarships, fellowship opportunities, and internships at Apple, giving students the opportunity to engage with Apple engineers and learn from their experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following in the footsteps of Apple and Spotify, Facebook will launch its own podcast platform offering next week, based on emails seen by The Verge.





According to the messages, which were sent to podcast page owners, Facebook will roll out the podcast service on June 22, and content creators will be able to link their show's RSS feed to Facebook, which will generate News Feed posts for all subsequent episodes.



"Facebook will be the place where people can enjoy, discuss, and share the podcasts they love with each other," said the company in the emails.



Podcast episodes will appear in a forthcoming "Podcasts" tab, which was teased by the company in April. Facebook will also offer podcast creators an optional feature that lets listeners create clips of shows of up to one minute in length for sharing. 



Facebook isn't asking for a cut of any revenue that podcasters generate, but the terms of service state that Facebook reserves the right to make "derivative works" with content distributed on its platform.



The move follows growing interest in podcasts as another potential market of original content, with Apple recently launching its own paid subscriptions service in the Podcasts app. Apple takes 30% of all subscription revenue that creators generate in their first year on the platform, and after that, Apple takes a 15% cut.



Spotify has invested heavily in deals to exclusively distribute podcast shows in recent years, and offers a similar podcast subscription feature to Apple, except the streaming service doesn't collect revenue on any of the content it hosts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly eyeing a new partnership with LG that would allow the South Korean tech giant to sell iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches at its more than 400 retail "LG Best Shops" in South Korea, according to a report from Business Korea.





LG recently shut down its smartphone business, leaving retail space previously used for marketing its handsets being left empty. Apple is now, apparently, eyeing to use that retail space to sell its own iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Apple's own retail presence in South Korea is still relatively small, and accepting a deal with LG to sell its products at more than 400 "LG Best Shops" is an easy way to expand its presence.

The two companies are reportedly discussing the establishment of separate Apple corners within the shops that are directly run by Apple employees or allowing LG Best Shop employees to sell Apple products after LG Electronics acquires the right to the sale of Apple products. The two sides have yet to decide when the partnership starts, but some market experts predict that it will be some time after the end of July when LG Electronics completely pull out of the smartphone business
According to the report, LG and Apple are at a disagreement over the sale of Mac computers. LG sells its own "Gram" laptops, and offering Apple's Mac in the store would be a disadvantage. As a result, the two sides are likely only to agree on selling iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. An LG spokesperson said in a statement to Business Korea that "nothing has been decided yet" and that they're "exploring all possibilities."

        <updated>2021-06-16T21:24:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key new feature of macOS Monterey is the ability to AirPlay content to a supported Mac from other Apple devices, such as an iPhone or iPad, and we've confirmed with Apple that this will include Apple Fitness+ workout videos with one limitation.





After starting an Apple Fitness+ workout on an iPhone or iPad, users will be able to wirelessly stream the audio and video to a supported Mac using AirPlay, providing a convenient way to view the workouts on a larger screen. The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.



AirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:
MacBook Pro (2018 and later)


MacBook Air (2018 and later)


iMac (2019 and later)


iMac Pro (2017)


Mac mini (2020 and later)


Mac Pro (2019)
We've encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.



Apple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.



Launched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.

A multiplayer game for friendship
 There are some multiplayer games that come with a warning: Play with your friends and family at your own risk. That includes games like Overcooked and any Mario Party title — Overcooked for the stress of working together in chaotic scenarios, and Mario Party for the inevitable strain of betrayal. This doesn’t mean these games aren’t great or fun: They’re fantastic! They can both bring you together or tear you apart. But in the end, the games are infamous — for different reasons — for the fights they create.
However, I’ve found the antidote: Chicory: A Colorful Tale. Released in June, Chicory is a 2D adventure game named after a famous painter who stops paint…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously, there are trees. But speaking phylogenetically, trees aren’t a thing. Some things that are trees evolved from things that are not trees and other things that are trees evolved into things that aren’t trees. Confused? This might clear things up.
“Trees” are not a coherent phylogenetic category. On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are absolutely, 100% not trees. This means that, for instance, either:
The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.


See also there’s no such thing as a vegetable and there’s no such thing as a fish.
What would the evolutionary tree of salmon, lungfish, and cows be? The answer, it appears at first glance, is simple. Salmon and lungfish, being fish, would cluster nicely together on one branch, and very non-fishy cows would be off on a separate branch. Right? Wrong. Contrary to what you might expect, what you see above is their evolutionary tree. Working up from the root, the lineage that leads to salmon branches off first. Keep tracing up the tree, and you’ll see that the lineage from which the salmon branched off eventually branches into two new lineages: the one leading to lungfish and the other leading to cows. In other words, a cow and a lungfish are more closely related to one another than either is to salmon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple would not be permitted to sell iPhones with its own apps installed under proposed U.S. antitrust legislation that was released last week. Representative David Cicilline confirmed the self-preferencing ban in a discussion with reporters, details of which were shared by Bloomberg.





Rather than pre-installed apps, Apple would have to offer other app options for consumers to download. Right now, iPhones come with a range of free Apple-designed apps from Messages and FaceTime to Calendar and Notes.



"It would be equally easy to download the other five apps as the Apple one so they're not using their market dominance to favor their own products and services," said Cicilline.



Preventing Apple from selling iPhones with its own apps installed would drastically change the iPhone's setup process, making it considerably less streamlined, more complicated, and potentially more expensive if customers were prompted to purchase or subscribe to third-party apps and services to replicate the functionality that Apple provides at no cost.



According to Cicilline, this would also apply to Amazon Prime because Amazon's ability to sell its own products over third-party products disadvantages some sellers.



U.S. House lawmakers last week debuted sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation in the form of five different bills aimed at major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The bills would apply to businesses that have a market capitalization of $600 billion and at least 50 million monthly active users in the United States.



If passed, these bills would overhaul competition laws that have not been revisited for decades and would lead to significant changes in the tech industry. The House Judiciary Committee will review the five bills at a hearing next week.

Cook was interviewed by Guillaume Lacroix, CEO and founder of Brut, a media company that creates short-form video content.






Much of the discussion centered on privacy, as it often does in interviews that Cook participates in. He reiterated once again how important privacy is to Apple.
We've been focused on privacy for over a decade. We see it as a basic human right. A fundamental human right. And we've been focused on privacy for decades.

But can its systems support more complex play?
 Free Lives is best known for its 2014 side-scrolling action game, Broforce. The game features pixelated caricatures of action movie heroes blowing stuff up with big guns and even bigger American flags. So imagine my surprise in early June when the team announced its next project, Terra Nil, a “reverse city-builder” about restoring wild areas after an ecological disaster.
After spending a few hours with an early demo of Terra Nil, it’s hard to imagine a bigger departure for the studio, but I’m all in. After nearly two years of homebound hyper-vigilance brought on by political chaos and a global pandemic, this is the deeply chill distraction that I needed.

Still talking defense!
 We simply cannot stop talking about defensemen around here, apparently. Next up on the board we have Simon Edvinsson, a Swedish left shot defenseman, and also one of the more polarizing players in this top prospect group. Edvinsson is a bit of a project, and scouts are divided on just how high his ceiling is, and what his chances are of reaching it, but the fact also remains that he possesses one of the more dynamic toolkits of this same top prospect group, and all of that makes him an intriguing name to watch.

This sale is available on Amazon, and only for the Gold color option. Stock appears to be low, although Amazon sometimes has more in stock than is reflected on the website.

Apple updated the MacBook Air in November 2020 with the new Apple M1 chip, which has an 8-core CPU, a 7- or 8-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine for machine learning. These updates brought about improved performance, better battery life, and more. There's also a 256GB model, but we aren't seeing any notable discounts this week.

On Monday, Apple said that some customers would be unable to make in-store purchases with their ‌Apple Card‌, and two days later, the issue continues to persist. These new issues follow a widespread Apple Card outage earlier this month that lasted several hours, impacting all ‌Apple Card‌ customers. The current issue facing some ‌Apple Card‌ customers is limited to in-store purchases, but online purchases seem to be working as normal. 



‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a tightly integrated financial service into Apple's products and services. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs to be the issuing bank for the card, meaning it's currently limited to just the United States. ‌Apple Card‌ features are integrated into the Wallet app with color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and up to three percent cashback on purchases, paid out daily.



Update: Apple's system status page now says that the issue is resolved and ‌Apple Card‌ is working as normal.

The project, which has since stalled due to internal concerns, was to offer customers an all-encompassing healthcare service that would integrate data collected from the iPhone and Apple Watch. On the project's heels, an internal team studied how data collected from the Apple Watch could improve healthcare service.

One of its most ambitious healthcare ideas was a plan to offer primary-care medicine, conceived in 2016, according to documents and the people familiar with the plan. An Apple team spent months trying to figure out how the flood of health and wellness data collected from use…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter is considering offering users the ability to "unmention" themselves in other people's tweets as part of a wider privacy drive for the social media platform.





The early concept has been shared by Twitter designed Dominic Camozzi, who says the idea behind it is to help users control unwanted attention.



An example image shows a notification when the user has been mentioned in a tweet, with an option to "Unmention yourself" (i.e. remove your Twitter handle from it) without the author of the tweet being notified of the change.



In another related option currently being weighed up, Twitter could send you a notification when someone you don't follow mentions you, allowing you to review the tweet, unmention yourself from it, and block that user from mentioning you again.




Notifications
Going further, if someone you don’t follow @ mentions you, you’ll get a special notification. If you unmention yourself from there, the Tweet author will not be able to mention you again. pic.twitter.com/RTFBEnkPFf
— Dominic Camozzi (@_dcrc_) June 14, 2021
 


Additionally, Camozzi is toying with the idea of giving users the ability to "control mass mentions" by preventing anyone on the platform from mentioning them for one day, three days, or seven days, thereby providing respite for anyone inundated with activity related to their account.



As with all early concepts, these changes may or may not be implemented by Twitter, and the company is actively looking for feedback from users regarding the ideas.

For persevering through his recovery, he gets an award. 
 The Philadelphia Flyers have won something for their 2020-21 season... well, a player has.
Oskar Lindblom has won the Bill Masterton Trophy as the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey on Tuesday.
Congrats, @oskarlindblom!   
An inspirational journey culminates with winning the Masterton Memorial Trophy. #NHLAwards pic.twitter.com/duFkbVvIJN
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) June 15, 2021



Back in December 2019, Lindblom was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer (Ewing’s sarcoma). His season ended immediately and the hockey world surrounded the Flyers’ winger with support.
Just several months later, he was able to ring the bell at the Abramson Cancer Center at Pennsylvania Hospital, signifying that his cancer treatments were complete and he was on his way to full recovery. And less than two months after that, he was back on the ice in the middle of a playoff series against the New York Islanders in September. A remarkable comeback for a player that has played a pivotal role on the team the most recent season.
After coming back from his diagnosis and recovery, Lindblom played 50 games and earned 14 points in his supporting role.
Lindblom is the fourth member of the Flyers to win the Masterton — Ian Lapierre (2011), Tim Kerr (1989), and Bobby Clarke (1972) have earned the honor before him as members of this organization. This season, San Jose Sharks legend Patrick Marleau was named a finalist for still playing well into his old age and passing Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL games played record, and Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba was the third finalist for continuing his presence as a co-founder of the Hockey Diversity Alliance and impacting his local community off the ice.
At least something pleasant has come as a result of the 2020-21 Philadelphia Flyers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, one of several new accessibility features that Apple has introduced is Background Sounds, which is designed to minimize distractions and help you stay focused, stay calm, and minimize distractions with the help of your iPhone or iPad.





The Background Sounds on offer include balanced, bright, and dark noise, as well as natural sounds like ocean, rain, and stream. All of the sounds can be set to play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.



The following steps explain how to enable Background Sounds on iOS devices running ‌iOS 15‌.
Launch the Settings app on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.


Tap Accessibility.


Under "Hearing," tap Audio/Visual.



Tap Background Sounds.


Tap the switch to turn on Background Sounds.


Tap Sound to choose a sound effect.


Choose from Balanced Noise, Bright Noise, Dark Noise, Ocean, Rain, and Stream.


Your device will need to download individual sound effects when you play them for the first time, so make sure you have an internet connection, but after that you can play the background sound whether or not you're online.

Officially licensed to ‘fuck shit up’ says Evil Geniuses’ MK11 star
 Five-time EVO champion SonicFox now has their own plushie. “This furry gremlin has been signed off by SonicFox to officially fuck shit up,” says the merch store for Evil Geniuses, SonicFox’s club since last spring.
The plushie is 10 by 11 by 4 inches, 100% polyester, and “Modeled after the ‘Defender of Trans Rights’ themselves,” says the plushie’s product page. “The community begged for it; SonicFox listened.” And that, as they say, is that.
SonicFox (real name Dominique McLean) was named Esports Player of the Year at The Game Awards 2018. In 2019, after coming out as non-binary, their 72-hour Mortal Kombat livestream raised $22,000 for The Trevor Project, a national advocacy organization focusing on LGBTQ persons under age 25. Active since 2013, SonicFox joined Evil Geniuses in March 2020, shortly after winning Mortal Kombat Final Kombat 20.
Most recently SonicFox took first place and a $15,000 prize in WePlay Esports Ultimate Fighting League’s Mortal Kombat 11 tournament, a Tier 1 event held in March. They prevailed 5-4 and 5-1 in the grand final using The Joker against Sayed “Tekken Master” Hashim Ahmed, playing as Cetrion.]]></summary>

The biggest new addition with the patch is probably coming to Zombies mode with the new Mauer der Toten round-based map.

Health Records is a feature that's designed to allow patients to view and aggregate all of their health data in one easy-to-access spot on the ‌iPhone‌. More than 700 institutions and 12,000 care locations now offer support for Health Records in the United States, Canada, and the UK.



Mayo Clinic patients who have a Patient Services Account can access that data through the Health app using their Patient Services username and password. The feature is opt-in and available as an option for Mayo Clinic patients with an ‌iPhone‌.
"There are more ways than ever for patients to be actively engaged in their health care, and smartphone apps can be helpful for accessing records and tracking daily fitness and diet," says Steve Ommen, M.D., medical director of Experience Products for Mayo Clinic's Center for Digital Health. "We want patients who are interested in these apps to be able to use them securely and enhance their health care at Mayo Clinic."
Health Records are downloaded onto the ‌iPhone‌ using an encrypted connection, with the data stored on the user's device and encrypted with a passcode to ensure everything is kept private. Health Records data is not available to Apple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With macOS Monterey, Apple has introduced expanded AirPlay 2 support, so you can ‌AirPlay‌ content from an iPhone, iPad, or even another Mac to your main Mac. We thought we'd do a quick demo of this handy new feature in our latest YouTube video.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


With ‌AirPlay‌ to Mac, you can extend or mirror an Apple device's display to a Mac, and since two Macs are supported, a Mac can use another Mac as an external display, which is a kind of substitute for the Target Display Mode that used to exist for Macs.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works wirelessly or using an appropriate cable, and the wired connection is useful for cutting down on latency.



You can also turn your Mac into a speaker that can be used for multiroom audio alongside other ‌AirPlay‌ 2 devices.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works with the 2018 or later MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, 2019 or later iMac or Mac Pro, the ‌iMac‌ Pro, and the 2020 or later Mac mini.



Apple has also added a useful new Universal Control feature that lets you control multiple Macs and iPads with a single keyboard, trackpad, or mouse, but Universal Control does not appear to be functional in the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta.

that’s me. I was five.

Also, fun fact: When we were watching a Mo Willems episode about drawing, he told us that his child is transgender — the one from Knuffle Bunny. Trixie is now Trix!

On Twitter, ‌Apple Music‌ users in India have been questioning why Spatial Audio is not available and when it might be launching, especially because the feature has been coming and going for some users. Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio has not yet officially launched in India, but Apple has not forgotten about the country and has confirmed that spatial audio is debuting soon.



The Apple Music website in India has a "coming soon" tag for Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio. There is no specific launch date available as of yet, but because some users have been seeing the options appear and disappear, it's likely ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers in India won't have too much longer to wait.

Yep, there’s another one!
 You read that right, folks, another Hughes brother has entered the chat. Luke Hughes is finally having his moment, and despite all of the talk around him that’s being circled back to his brothers ad nauseam, he’s been finding quite a bit of success for himself. After a bit of a slow start to his season, he picked up some steam as he went on, and ended up scoring at a cool .88 point per game pace (not too bad for a defenseman, certainly). But his season was cut short when he suffered a lacerated tendon in his foot from a skate cut, which required surgery. It was a tough way to end it, but it was a good year for him overall, and the individual hype he’s garnered because of it is well deserved.

The remaster brings back the original three games with updated graphics and additional, modern features like online challenges and leaderboards. It also introduces a comic book-style of storytelling and new playable characters. Key features of the original, like 4-player local co-op will still be present in the remaster. Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania recreates roughly 300 levels and 12 minigames from the first three games.
In the Super Monkey Ball franchise, players navigate a monkey in a hamster ball while playing sports-inspired minigames or perilous and zany obstacle courses. The first two games launched in the early 2000s  exclusively to the GameCube. The franchise has since launched on numerous platforms, consoles to mobile versions, with more than a dozen titles.
Sega also announced a Digital Deluxe version of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. It will feature six additional classic character skins, three legendary console skins, 10 customizable items and the classic soundtrack. Fans will also be able to grab a special 20th Anniversary Edition of the game that includes an art book, reversible cover, collectable sleeve and 10 cosmetic items. The Digital Deluxe edition will retail for $49.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The horror game was originally released on the Wii U
 The most recent game in the Fatal Frame series is getting a modern update with Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water for Nintendo Switch and other modern consoles. The new version of the game was revealed during Nintendo’s E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. 
The game takes place on the fictional Hikami Mountain where players control several different characters as they attempt to survive the notoriously supernatural mountain and the variety of hostile spirits and ghosts that occupy it. Each of the game’s protagonists lends a different prospective to the game’s overall story of Ose Kurosawa, a mysterious shrine maiden who was chosen to be part of a powerful and dark ritual. 
Maiden of Black Water is the fifth mainline game in the Fatal Frame series and was originally released in 2014 on Wii U. Just like all of the games in the series, this one focuses on a series of supernatural experiences and spirits that can only be warded off by using a special camera, called the Camera Obscura. The new version of the game will also come with new costumes and photo modes that weren’t in the original, as well as updated visuals.
Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X sometime later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today shared the trailer for the second season of animated comedy "Central Park," which is set to launch on Apple TV+ on Friday, June 25.






"Central Park" follows a family who serve as caretakers for Central Park in New York City and who must fend off a wealthy hotel heiress who wants to turn the park into condos.



In the second season, the family continues to navigate living in and caring for the park.
In season two of "Central Park," the Tillerman family continues to navigate living in and caring for the world's most famous park. Molly experiences the trials and tribulations of adolescence, Cole is challenged by a truly embarrassing moment at school, Paige continues to chase down the mayor's corruption story, and Owen juggles managing the park, his staff and his family all with a smile on his face. Meanwhile, Bitsy inches ever closer to her sinister goal of claiming Central Park as her own; with Helen by her side, eternally wondering whether she's made it into Bitsy's will. Every step of the way, we are guided along by our friendly, fumbling, fiddler narrator, Birdie.
"Central Park" characters are voiced by Josh Gad, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Kathryn Hahn, Tituss Burgess, and Stanley Tucci. It was created and written by Loren Bouchard, known for "Bob's Burgers."



The first season of "Central Park" was recognized with an Emmy Award nomination for Leslie Odom Jr., and was also nominated for the 2021 NAACP Image Awards in the Outstanding Animated Series category.

This video by Kurzgesagt leads us through what happened that day, minute by minute.
This video reminded me of Peter Brannen’s eye-popping description of this event from his book The Ends of the World:

Seth Jones might not be the surefire No. 1 defender that some prop him up to be, but he’s capable of returning to that level of play.
 I’ll preface this article by saying that I would prefer the Flyers to acquire a number of players instead of Seth Jones if they’re looking to fill the role of a top pair defender this offseason (they ought to be). Personally, the addition of any among Ryan Ellis, Dougie Hamilton, Mattias Ekholm, or John Klingberg would make me happier than seeing a blockbuster Jones trade on draft day. This is not an article advocating for the acquisition of Jones, so please don’t interpret it that way.
With all of that said, Seth Jones receives entirely too much vitriol from the analytics community when he’s a player who …]]></summary>

“Conference” final time!
 It’s chaos time, folks! We’re down to the final four in the playoffs, and none of these teams have seen each other all year, so this is surely going to be... interesting, to put it lightly. The playoffs have been weird so far, and they’re only going to get weirder, it seems. Is it a fool’s errand to try and make any kind of prediction here? Maybe, but that’s certainly not going to stop us from trying. 
Tampa Bay Lightning vs. New York Islanders

Maddie: I want to pick the Lightning here, because I think they’re the better team and that should win out and be the end of it. But I also think the Bruins are a better team than the Islanders and should have knocked them out last round, and we saw what happened there. But I'm g…]]></summary>

You have one week to try them all
 Xbox’s whirlwind week at E3 2021 isn’t just limited to big new IPs and AAA launches on Xbox Game Pass. Starting today, Xbox One and Xbox Series X owners can also get their hands on demo versions of 40 yet-to-be-released indie games as part of the ID@Xbox Summer Game Demo Fest.
If you want to try them out, you shouldn’t wait. The showcase only runs for one week, from June 15-21. 
The list of demos is filled with upcoming indie titles like the adorable animal-filled adventure game Button City and the Tribeca Film Festival award-nominated Sable. Oh, and also you can go play Lawn Mowing Simulator, if that scratches your virtual homeowner’s itch. 
Here are the 12 newly announced games coming to Xbox you can play:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using publicly available datasets of English words, their etymologies, and their semantic distances, software engineer Daniel de Haas generated pairs & triples of words that have a common origin but otherwise are unrelated to each other. 
“actor” & “coagulate”
Both of these words derive ultimately from the Latin “ago”, meaning “act”, “do”, “make”, and a bunch of other things.
English “actor” is a short hop away from “ago”, but “coagulate” takes a longer path: “ago” ➔ “cogo” (“collect”) ➔ “coagulum” (“a clot”) ➔ “coagulo” (“to clot”).



“educate” & “subdue”
“Educate” comes from the Latin “eductus”, meaning to “lead or bring out”, and then the Latin “educare” (“raise, train, mould”). I love the image of education as the process of extruding a refined person out of a base of unrefined material.
“Subdue” comes from the latin “subduco”, meaning “lead under”. Again, a very clear physical description of what the word means — to put beneath you, or bring under control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twelve South today launched the "SurfacePad for iPhone 12," a new MagSafe-compatible wallet folio case for the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 mini. The $49.99 leather case comes in brown cognac, black, and plum colors.





The SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ was designed to protect the front and back of the ‌iPhone 12‌, and includes two interior pockets for ID and bank cards. Since the cards are on the front portion of the folio, you'll also be able to wirelessly charge your ‌iPhone 12‌ with the SurfacePad on, unlike Apple's first party wallet accessory.



To attach SurfacePad to an ‌iPhone 12‌, there's a "SurfaceGrip 2.0" adhesive on the back of the accessory, which sticks to the back of your iPhone. Twelve South says this adhesive is reusable and super secure and it leaves no trace of sticky residue when removed.





You can purchase SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ on Twelve South's website today for $49.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today announced an investigation into the "duopoly" of Apple and Google on mobile ecosystems, just one day after a similar investigation was initiated in Japan.







The CMA will be taking a closer look at Apple and Google's "effective duopoly" on the supply of operating systems, including iOS and Android, the App Store and Google Play Store, and web browsers such as Safari and Chrome. The CMA defines "mobile ecosystems" as "gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services," meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.



The CMA says that consumers could be "losing out across a wide range of areas" as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to "reduced innovation" and "consumers paying higher prices." The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies' market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.



The CMA was already investigating Apple's ‌App Store‌ policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.



The UK is also in the process of establishing a new "pro-competition" regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. 



Yesterday, the Japan Times reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google's duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple in iPadOS 15 has added the ability to access NTFS-formatted media from within the Files app. The additional support for the Windows-related format, first discovered by YouTuber Steven Fjordstrøm, is read-only, so like on macOS you can't modify files stored on NTFS devices, but you can at least copy any data on them for working on elsewhere on your iPad.





The Files app has also gotten a new circular progress indicator to indicate the transfer of data when moving or copying files. Tapping the graphic opens a larger progress bar showing further details on the data transferred/remaining, the estimated time remaining, and the ability to cancel the transfer.



In another notable addition to the Files app, if you're using a mouse or trackpad, it's now possible to click-hold and drag a selection box over multiple files and folders to perform batch actions, such as compress, move, copy, and so on. Lastly, you can also now use Groups as a view option, so that files and folders are arranged on the screen in separate sections according to kind.



What do you think about the new additions to the Files app? Let us know in the comments. ‌iPadOS 15‌ is currently going through beta testing with developers, with a public beta due out next month and an official release in the fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple last month announced that the HomePod mini would be made available in several new countries in June. Now, less than a month later, the ‌HomePod mini‌ has officially launched in Austria and Ireland, and is listed as "available in June" in New Zealand, suggesting availability in the next couple of weeks.





The ‌HomePod mini‌ is the follow-up to the original HomePod released in 2018. The full-sized ‌HomePod‌ failed to become a mainstream hit, leading to its discontinuation. The $99 ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌ but offers the same functionality enabled by Siri. 



The ‌HomePod mini‌ first launched in October of 2020 in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Spain, and the UK. Both the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ will gain support for Apple Music's recently launched lossless audio feature via a software update later this year. Additionally, the ‌HomePod mini‌ will be able to be set as the default output speaker for Apple TV 4K starting later this year.

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-tv-plus-three-month-free-trial/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-15T08:49:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while now, Apple has been running a promotion that offers a free one-year trial of Apple TV+ with any iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch purchase. That promotion ends on June 30, and Apple has today updated its website to show that from July 1 the included free trial shrinks to three months with eligible device purchases.





Apple has frequently offered promotions or credit for users to stay subscribed to the still relatively new service. Launched in 2019, ‌Apple TV+‌ continues to grow into a more mainstream streaming service; however, it still has some ways before catching up to Netflix and others. Apple offers original shows such as "Ted Lasso," "The Morning Show," and "See" on the platform.



The new three-month trial will go into effect on July 1, so customers wanting to maximize their free ‌Apple TV+‌ subscription should purchase their product before the beginning of next month. Devices purchased before then will continue to be eligible for a one-year trial. 



The offer of a generous year-long free trial for ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ has been an important part of Apple's strategy to lure in long-term subscribers by giving unfettered access to the full roster of content on the streaming service. ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ launched with a small amount of content compared with other rival services, so it has been crucial for Apple to build goodwill and interest about the service's shows without expecting immediate returns. The company now appears to feel that the content offering has grown enough that a shorter trial will suffice going forward.



The new extension comes ahead of a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, where several hit shows, such as "Ted Lasso" and "The Morning Show," will see their second seasons debut.

        <updated>2021-06-15T07:52:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Apple has now announced that Apple Podcast Subscriptions for shows and channels is rolling out worldwide, showcasing a large number of new shows, groups of podcasts, and channels.



When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they automatically follow the show and the page is updated with a Subscriber Edition label so it is clear that they have access to the premium experience. As listeners subscribe to more channels, the Listen Now tab expands with new rows to provide easy access to all subscription content. Listeners who subscribe to two or more channels will also see a My Channels row in the Listen Now tab.








As expected, Apple Podcasts has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.





Apple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then decided to delay its launch to ensure that the "best experience" is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.



All subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple's 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-music-android-beta-spatial-lossless-audio/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-15T07:44:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Apple last week launched Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio for Apple Music, it said that the new features would be "coming soon" to Android. Now, the company has released a new ‌Apple Music‌ beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.





As per the changelog for the release, spotted by 9to5Google:

In this update, ‌Apple Music‌ adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.



Other updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.
In the app's Settings menu, there is a new "Audio Quality" sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.



The beta release for ‌Apple Music‌ 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.



Note that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.



Getting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‌Apple Music‌ user base on Android won't have to wait much longer to get these features, too.



Apple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‌iPhone‌ 7 and later, all iPad Pro models, the 6th-generation ‌iPad‌ or later, the iPad Air 3 and later, the fifth-generation iPad mini and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/MacBook Air, and the 2020 or later iMac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, you can enable anyone, even if they don't have an Apple device, to join a FaceTime call with you by creating a link to a ‌FaceTime‌ conversation that can be shared anywhere.





Using this new link facility, friends and family members who do not have an Apple account can log into a ‌FaceTime‌ call with you using a web browser opened on any non-Apple device, whether that's a Windows PC or an Android phone.



This effectively makes ‌FaceTime‌ a platform-agnostic video service, although you do need to be an iOS or Mac user to start the ‌FaceTime‌ call and send the link. Here's how it works in ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌.




Launch the FaceTime app on your iPhone or iPad.


Tap Create Link.


Give your ‌FaceTime‌ Link an identifiable name by tapping Add Name at the top of the Actions menu that appears.


Select a method of sharing your link from the Actions menu, e.g. over Messages or Mail.




Once you've sent the link and the recipient opens it, they'll be directed to a web page where they can enter their name to join the conversation. Once they've joined the call, they'll have the usual ‌FaceTime‌ options to mute their microphone, disable video, switch the camera view, and leave the call.





For more information on all the new ‌FaceTime‌ features in ‌iOS 15‌, be sure to check out our upcoming dedicated guide.

What remained unclear to fans, however, was how they were actually going to fly those airplanes on a console. Sure, you could use an Xbox controller, but the grass is especially green on the PC side of the fence with a boatload of boutique controllers and high-end joysticks.

Capcom says DLC is now in development
 The story of Resident Evil Village will continue in a new expansion, Capcom announced Tuesday during its E3 2021 showcase. By popular demand, Capcom said, “development has just started” on additional DLC for the game. 
Unfortunately, Capcom did not provide details about its plans, but promised more info at a later date.
Resident Evil Village producer Tsuyoshi Kanda said that players will have something to look forward to next month, however. Kanda announced that Resident Evil RE: Verse, the deathmatch multiplayer mode that features heroes and bioweapons from the Resident Evil franchise, will go live in July after a brief delay.
The previous game in the franchise, Resident Evil 7 biohazard, received a number of post-release story-based add-ons, including Banned Footage Vol. 1 and 2, Not A Hero starring Chris Redfield, and End of Zoe.
Resident Evil Village was released in May for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. In our review of the first-person survival-horror game, we called Village’s blend of gunplay and scares “the perfect cocktail of horror and action.”]]></summary>

Still green, though
 Microsoft is, apparently, changing the game cases for Xbox titles. Box art seen at Best Buy and other retailers more prominently calls out the compatible platforms while eschewing the embossed Xbox logo that fronted game cases since the launch of Xbox One.
It’s a subtle change and, considering how many full copy sales of video games take place online today, one that some may not notice for a while. It also seems necessary considering Microsoft is supporting two consoles and, the Xbox Series X’s backward compatibility notwithstanding, some games are in fact Series X only.
Microsoft has long aspired to unify its video games presence under a single brand, but it still can’t quite seal the deal. Xbox games are sold on The Microsoft Store, for example, while PC subscribers peruse the Xbox Game Pass for PC library. And let us never speak of Games for Widows Live, which Microsoft needed two years to finally shut down.
Bottom line to you, the consumer: Not much, really. The design change probably means Microsoft saves a few cents stamping the Xbox logo on the top. We now return you to your regularly scheduled E3.]]></summary>

 Xbox fans wondering why Rare’s Everwild didn’t show up at Sunday’s E3 showcase now have an answer: The studio has “completely rebooted” the open-world adventure game under a new creative director, and its release is multiple years away, reports Video Games Chronicle.
Citing sources with knowledge of Everwild’s development, VGC reports that Rare has undertaken “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction” following the departure last fall of its previous creative director, Simon Woodroffe. Gregg Mayles — who has worked at Rare for more than three decades, and is the studio’s most senior employee on the creative side, according to VGC — has been tapped as creative director for the ongoing reboot, VGC repo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular iOS and Mac-based journaling app Day One has been acquired by Automattic, a company best known for running WordPress.com. News of the acquisition was announced today on the Day One blog.





The Day One app will continue to be run separately, and Day One founder Paul Mayne will continue to lead the Day One team. Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.
When a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company. That's not the case here. I'll be remaining at the helm of Day One, leading the same passionate team that has been responsible for the development and design behind the app today. This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn't going away. Instead, it'll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.
Day One's privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it's long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.



Day One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings. Day One Premium is priced at $3.99 per month and the app can be downloaded from the App Store. [Direct Link]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nomad, known for its range of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the Card for AirTag, which is designed to make it easier for an AirTag to fit inside a wallet for tracking purposes.





With Card for AirTag, an AirTag fits inside the middle of a card-shaped holder that's then meant to fit inside of a wallet. According to Nomad, the design offers a smooth, uniform shape that allows the AirTag to be kept in the wallet without having a circular bump.



The Card for AirTag is made from a polycarbonate material with a soft-touch TPU surface, and the AirTag is designed to snap into the middle.





It's worth noting that the AirTag is quite thick on its own and not really designed for use within wallets, so this Card for AirTag is still going to take up a lot of space. Thin wallets may not accommodate the thickness of the AirTag and the accompanying Card accessory.



The Card for AirTag is priced at $20, but there's a $5 discount when bundled with one of Nomad's wallets. Nomad is also today releasing new Bi-Fold and Card wallets priced starting at $69.95. The Card for AirTag and the new wallets can be purchased from the Nomad website.

According to the new  roadmap, season 4 will have a new round-based Zombies map, new weapons, new maps, and another update to Verdansk — just not quite as big as the last one. 
The new addition to Verdansk will be a new location centered around a crashed satellite — the focus of the season’s reveal trailer, which debuted during Summer Games Fest last week. It seems that the crash will take out some existing structures, but is also big enough for players to fight in and around. Meanwhile, Verdansk’s season 3 Reloaded addition of the Nak…]]></summary>

Computer, enhance
 Bethesda Softworks formally unveiled Starfield, its highly anticipated new role-playing game, on Sunday during the Xbox showcase. And in a surprise twist, eagle-eyed fans on Reddit have found what they think could be a teaser for Bethesda Game Studios’ next new game: The Elder Scrolls 6. We’ve seen the evidence, and ... yeah. There could definitely be a big, fat Easter egg hidden in plain sight.
[Warning: This story could contain spoilers for the next game in The Elder Scrolls series of single-player RPGs.]

Jack wants chaos? Jack gets chaos
 Square Enix revealed a new spinoff Final Fantasy game at its E3 2021 press conference on Sunday, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin. And while a new Final Fantasy game might sound like exciting news at a conference thin with announcements, fans were quick to notice a fatal flaw with its protagonist, Jack. 
He wears a T-shirt.  
He dons a simple, black, short-sleeved shirt with buttons on the front. If it weren’t for the ragged hem hanging down over his crotch and butt, it looks like something you could buy from the men’s section at Target. It might sound like a small thing, but this is the world of Final Fantasy, where everybody and their mom usually has an ornate, whimsical character designs. And Jack is the protagonist…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the New Yorker, Hannah Fry wrote a brief history of information visualization, a quiet innovation that has changed the world:
Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, “only a graph speaks directly to the eyes.” Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them — and the stakes dependent on those differences — became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, “If the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.”
Van Langren’s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study “Visual Explanations” (1997), “Maps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.” Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error — how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.


Van Langren’s graph, which Fry says “might be the first statistical graph in history”, is pictured at the top of this post.

PlatinumGames’ latest looks a little rough around the edges, but there’s hope
 On Sunday, Square Enix showed off new gameplay from Babylon’s Fall, the PlatinumGames-developed hack-and-slash that was first announced way back in 2018. It looked drastically different from the early gameplay preview we saw in late 2019, which made Babylon’s Fall look like a fairly traditional PlatinumGames release.
It also, frankly, looked a little ... off. What I (and others) perceived as heavily compressed streaming video artifacts obscuring the game’s graphics is actually Babylon’s Fall’s intentional art style. PlatinumGames says it’s going for a “visual style is based on classical European oil paintings” that it calls “brushwork style.” To wit, taking a closer look at direct-feed screenshots of Babylon’s Fall reveals that the graphics are being treated with a canvas-like texture and what appear to be actual brushstrokes.
“Our goal was to create a deeply layered, high quality fantasy world rendered in the oil painting style seen in classic sword and sorcery fantasy works,” said Babylon’s Fall game director Kenji Saito in a behind-the-scenes look at development.


PlatinumGames and Square Enix tapped artist Kouji Tajima to create the game’s high-fantasy art style. Tajima’s previous work is mostly in live-action film, he says, working on movies like Terminator: Dark Fate, Venom, Blade Runner 2049, and the Fantastic Beasts series.
The most encouraging bit of news on Babylon’s Fall is who’s overseeing it, the aforementioned game director Kenji Saito. He directed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Transformers Devastation, two of Platinum’s better games. He’s joined by Isao Negishi, lead game designer on Babylon’s Fall, who had the same credit on Nier: Automata.
Babylon’s Fall is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam. Square Enix has not announced a release date.]]></summary>

According to Apple's release notes, iOS 12.5.4 introduces important security updates and is recommended for all users. Apple often releases security updates for older devices that are no longer able to get the current version of iOS in order to keep users protected from malware and other security vulnerabilities.



Apple's security support document says that the update addresses three vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Two of them that affected WebKit may have been actively exploited. One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.

Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV models, the tvOS 14.7 developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There's no word yet on what's included in tvOS 14.7 update, but we'll update this article should anything new be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

Halo multiplayer is all about hunting for power weapons
 Players got some new details around Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer during 343 Industries and Microsoft’s Halo multiplayer livestream on Monday. The livestream showed off a little more than 10 minutes of new gameplay and developer interviews. It gave 343 Industries an opportunity to deliver its philosophy for Halo Infinite's multiplayer: old school.
Early in the stream, 343 Industries developers made it clear that players will start on equal footing with “fair and balanced starts,” and that they wanted to go back to the old-school Halo style of hunting for power weapons once you spawn. However, it’s not currently clear if Halo Infinite will have loadouts.

Infinite will also give players more customization options than ever, including the AI voice in multiplayer
 343 Industries is totally reshaping Halo’s multiplayer customization in Halo Infinite by adding a few hallmarks of popular free-to-play games. The studio released a multiplayer overview on Monday, where it revealed what players could expect for all the game’s cosmetics when it comes out later this year. 
Because Infinite is the first Halo game to feature free-to-play multiplayer, it’s no surprise that the team at 343 is ramping up cosmetics and customization. Not only does it give the developer more items to sell, but Infinite is inviting players to spend hundreds of hours in the Halo arena, and with time investment like that it’s always more fu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Cold War, the Soviet Union controlled the music recording industry and even restricted the types of music that were allowed to be played & listened to. Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock & roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:
X-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl — some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand — and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.


And from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:
Before the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‘n’ roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.
“Usually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,” says Sergei Khrushchev. “Before the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.”
“They would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,” says author Anya von Bremzen. “You’d have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha’s brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.”


To learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates’ book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records — here’s Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:

The Beats Studio Buds are available to order today in red, white, and black ahead of a June 24 ship date, and they're priced at $149.99.





The Studio Buds are the first Beats-branded earbuds to truly compete with AirPods thanks to their wire-free design that fits comfortably in the ear without the over-ear hook seen on Powerbeats Pro.






In many respects, the Studio Buds are competitive with AirPods Pro at a lower price point, with a diminutive design that's slightly lighter than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ while still offering features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency modes.

This is a pivotal offseason for Chuck Fletcher with the Flyers’ veteran core and underperforming youngsters at a crossroads.
 When you look at the Philadelphia Flyers roster, it’s split into a few different groups. 
There is the veteran core made up of a few guys that have been here for years (Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek, Sean Couturier) plus the recent additions (Kevin Hayes, James van Riemsdyk).  All five of those players are 28 years old (or older) with varying contract statuses. The two most valuable Flyers forwards in that group — Giroux and Couturier —have their contracts expire after next season, while the other three are under contract through 2023 (JVR), 2024 (Voracek), and 2026 (Hayes).
This is the veteran core that could be s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced that the second season of drama series "The Morning Show" will premiere September 17 on Apple TV+. The 10-episode season will premiere with the first episode, followed by one new episode weekly, every Friday.



Apple shared a teaser trailer for the second season on YouTube:






Starring and executive produced by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, "The Morning Show" unveils the power dynamics in the workplace between women and men, and women and women, in a morning talk show environment. Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, the star-studded returning cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, and others.



Apple's announcement sets the stage for what to expect in season two:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds "The Morning Show" team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley's (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.
Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial available. An extended one-year free trial is also available with the purchase of most new Apple devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the Photos app, such as the ability to see the EXIF data for a photo. The latter feature is accessed via a new "Info" button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.





In addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn't take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the HomePod image was saved from the web via Safari. 



This metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the "Saved from" location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don't have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll. 



The new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you've saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.



‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.

Studio Fizbin’s thoughtful puzzle-platformer got a surprise release on Sunday
 You’ve heard this story before. Though the details may be different, the thrust of the story is the same. When the world goes to shit, there’s only one person who can save us — the chosen one, through their sheer power of chosen-ness, must set off on a calamitous journey to stop whatever terrible thing is threatening the world. 
It’s Link in the Legend of Zelda, Master Chief in Halo, Kratos in God of War. These sorts of heroes also appear in smaller-scale stories, in more intimate worlds, like the player-character in Cozy Grove, perpetually taking on everyone else’s needs. But being a hero can be isolating, even traumatic.

Coming to PC and consoles in 2022
 PC gamers itching for a Pikmin-like fix have Tinykin to look forward to in 2022. The game, from developer Splashteam, stars a tiny protagonist and a small army of helpful insects — the titular Tinykin — was revealed Sunday during the PC Gaming Show.
Here’s the narrative setup for Tinykin:
It’s the year 2748 and Milo has re-discovered Earth! He’d go down in history for this achievement, but when he lands on the planet he encounters a problem... He’s as small as a penny. And everybody’s gone. And it’s the ’90s.

As Milo, players will explore a giant house, using Tinykin to maneuver through an oversized world by building ladders, bridges, carrying objects, and more. Milo can also jump, skate, and grind, as you can see in the game’s debut trailer above.
Tinykin is coming to Windows PC and unannounced consoles next year. Developer Splashteam is composed of ex-Ubisoft developers who have worked on the Rayman and Rabbids franchises.]]></summary>

The game won’t be free-to-play after all
 Icarus, the next game from DayZ creator Dean Hall’s Rocketwerkz studio, launches on Steam Aug. 11. In a surprise announcement, the session-based multiplayer survival game will not be free-to-play. Instead the game will cost $29.99, and will be released in chapters. The announcement was made Sunday during the PC Gaming Show presentation, and was accompanied by a new trailer.
“We didn’t want the business model to get in the way of the game experience,” Hall said in a news release. “We also heard loud and clear from our community that they wanted to avoid the pitfalls of free-to-play. We want Icarus to continually evolve as a living game, always adding new session challenges and game modes. We think regular chapters and content updates are a great way to deliver.” 
Icarus puts players in the role of pioneering explorers trying to tame a wild, alien world. The session-based gameplay puts a time limit on each mission, challenging players to gather resources before their ship back to orbit leaves them behind. You can read more, including an interview with Dean Hall, in our hands-on preview. 
A deluxe edition, which will include two follow-on chapters of downloadable content, will also be available for $99.95.]]></summary>

 Starfield is the next large-scale, AAA role-playing game from Fallout and Skyrim makers Bethesda Game Studios. It will launch Nov. 11, 2022. The spacefaring RPG, first teased in 2018, is Bethesda’s biggest all-new video game world in the past 25 years. Here’s what we know about it, so far.
WHAT IS STARFIELD?
“Skyrim in space,” Todd Howard told The Washington Post. Howard is the executive producer for Bethesda Game Studios and the creative leader of its Elder Scrolls franchise since 2000. In other words, this is the full-featured Bethesda Game Studios RPG experience, seen in games like The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and Fallout 5, just applied to an all-new, science fiction setting.

Square Enix is going full character action with a new Final Fantasy spinoff
 Ninja Gaiden and Nioh developer Team Ninja is making a new Final Fantasy spinoff game for Square Enix. Titled Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin and pitched as “a bold new vision for Final Fantasy,” the game is scheduled to launch in 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is being developed by Final Fantasy veterans Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima in conjunction with Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo Games.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin appears heavy on action. In the game’s E3 2021 reveal trailer, we see a trio of Warriors of Light battling a variety of creatures and enemies, and, ultimately, the evil knight Garland from the original Final Fantasy. Square Enix’s official description of the game reads: “Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine. Yet doubts remain—are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?”
A trial version of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is available now from the PlayStation Store. It will be available on PlayStation 5 through June 24.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.]]></summary>

The next Life is Strange game, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 10, is about a 21-year-old Asian American woman named Alex Chen who moves to Colorado to reunite with her brother Gabe. When her brother mysteriously dies, Alex uses her supernatural power, Empathy, to find out what happened in the quiet mountain town.

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The trailer page says War for Wakanda will launch in August of this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed iOS 15, which is available now in beta for developers ahead of a public release later this year. One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.



MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:

Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally 🎉 #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq
— Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021
 
Cross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.



From the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:
Drag and drop

With support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.
To drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.



In many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that's dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.



The first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.

Devolver Forwarder promises wackiness
 Publisher Devolver Digital brings its singular brand of video game publisher zaniness to E3 2021 (or at least close to it) with a new livestream on Saturday, June 12. Dubbed the Devolver MaxPass+ stream, the event promises new looks at upcoming games, including gameplay for Shadow Warrior 3 and Death’s Door.
Devolver MaxPass+ (aka Devolver Forwarder) kicks off at 4:30 p.m. EDT/1:30 p.m. PDT, and will stream on Twitch. Devolver Digital promises five new game reveals from its stable of developers including Flying Wild Hog, Galvanic Games, and Doinksoft, as well as release date announcements for Phantom Abyss and Death’s Door.

New Avatar game set for 2022 release
 Ubisoft has unveiled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a first-person action-adventure game set in James Cameron’s Avatar universe. A new trailer highlighted the game’s central conflict, focusing on air-to-air combat between humans and the Na’vi.
First announced in February 2017, we now know the game has been built on Ubisoft’s proprietary Snowdrop Engine — the same technology that underpins The Division. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, in partnership with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney itself.
“In this new, standalone story,” Ubisoft says in the game’s description, “play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back on the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.”

The Siege of Paris follows Wrath of the Druids
 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s developers have post-launch support planned “well into” the game’s second year. Highlights, announced during the Ubisoft Forward livestream on Saturday, include a story expansion called The Siege of Paris, and an educational Discovery Tour mode similar to the ones made for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey.
Ubisoft did not give a specific launch date for The Siege of Paris, other than to say it would arrive this summer. The game’s first premium expansion, The Wrath of the Druids, just launched in May. That chapter took place in Ireland; this one takes players to France for “the most ambitious battle in Viking history,” Ubisoft’s Karen Lee told viewers. 
The Siege of Paris is premium content, and will be available a la carte or with the game’s Season Pass. The new chapter also brings back “black box” missions, in which the player is given only a single infiltration objective. How they complete the task is entirely up to them.
The Viking Age Discovery Tour, like its two predecessors, will be a free update to all with the game. It’s a combat-free exploration mode and, like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s tour, it will allow users to create and pursue role-playing missions for the world’s inhabitants.
Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla launched in November on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna services.]]></summary>

Siege is also getting a new Operator called Thunderbird
 Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer shooters around on both console and PC and it’s finally getting cross-play ... but with some caveats. The announcement  came at Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation on Saturday.
On June 30, Ubisoft will add cross-play and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege between all of its various PC platforms including standard PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna. Players from all three platforms will be able to queue into games together. For consoles, cross-play will be released in early 2022, when players on PlayStation and Xbox will be able to jump into games together. It does not appear that Ubisoft will let PC and console players compete together, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise.

According to Ubisoft’s announcement, these updates will also include cross-progression across “all platforms” as part of one unified account, so you can earn rewards no matter where you’re playing. 


Right after the announcement of cross-play and cross-progression, Ubisoft also gave fans a new look at the game’s newest Defensive Operator, Thunderbird. The Thunderbird preview came in the form of an gorgeous animated trailer where the new Operator takes on a bear with a flare gun and lives to tell the tale. 
Thunderbird will be available as part of Siege’s North Star update and event, which starts next week on June 14.]]></summary>

Ubisoft announces Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph as playable characters
 Far Cry 6’s season pass will add three villains from previous Far Cry games as playable characters, Ubisoft announced at its E3 2021 press conference Saturday. As seen in the trailer above, Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3, Pagan Min from Far Cry 4, and Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5 will be playable characters in post-release content for Far Cry 6.
The content appears dreamlike or hallucinogenic in nature, giving Ubisoft a narrative out for its Far Cry 6 DLC. Not that it’s ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5’s post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.
The season pass content also includes Far Cry 3’s DLC Blood Dragon.
The revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, “Vaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me. I still get recognized as Vaas, and I still feel the outpouring of love for that character - makes me very happy. Who knows... maybe I will reprise the role very soon?”
Far Cry 6, by Ubisoft Toronto, launches Oct. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna platforms. The game stars Giancarlo Esposito as the primary antagonist; he is El Presidente, Anton Castillo, the autocratic ruler determined to crush an uprising bent on regime change. Our preview from two weeks ago has more.
Update: This story has been updated with confirmation from Ubisoft.]]></summary>

While many iPhone and iPad games already offer on-screen controls, Apple's new virtual game controller is available to all developers, easy to add, and can be customized on a per-game basis. Apple said the on-screen controller can be adjusted to a variety of layouts, with up to four buttons and a thumbstick, d-pad, or touchpad available per left and right side.



"These new on-screen controls for iPhone and iPad look amazing, and they're carefully tuned for grip locations across hand sizes and for a great responsiveness and feel," said Nat Brown, an Apple engineer working on Game Technologies.



Apple offers a WWDC session and developer documentation with more details.

Season Pass owners can add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec cells
 Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline, the story expansion for those who bought the game’s premium season pass, will launch July 6, Ubisoft said on Saturday. The story brings back Aiden Pearce from the first Watch Dogs and Wrench from the second as playable characters.
Pearce, according to Ubisoft’s news release, has come to London to reconnect with his nephew, Jackson. He’s supposed to infiltrate a Broca Tech lab and steal some cutting edge technology — but Wrench gets the device first and flees. With his job botched, Pearce and his nephew are now on the lam from those who hired him.
Ubisoft’s statement says Bloodline is a prequel to the main campaign of Watch Dogs: Legion. It will also offer several side quests for both characters to complete.
Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline is available a la carte for $14.99 to those without the Season Pass. The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn’t get it with one of two premium editions in the game’s October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.
Watch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon’s Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.
Post-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.]]></summary>

Tactical alien action with Rainbow Six operators
 Rainbow Six is getting back to its tactical co-op roots, sort of. The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game’s latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation. 
The trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. 


Rainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege’s Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies — instead of the series’ usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020’s pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. 
Just like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series’ tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down — or escape from — infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege — including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  
Rainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.]]></summary>

Gearbox has Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands movie, and more in store
 Borderlands developer Gearbox Software is heading to E3 2021 armed with a new game, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands — the high-fantasy spinoff of its shooter-looter series — and a new movie. Gearbox fans expect to hear more about Borderlands — the Eli Roth-directed movie starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Jamie Lee Curtis — during its E3 Showcase on Saturday.
Gearbox Entertainment will take over the official E3 2021 livestream on Saturday, June 12 at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT. The event, which is expected to run about 30 minutes, will stream on E3’s YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter channels.
Beyond Wonderlands and Borderlands, don’t be surprised if a few Gearbox Publishing titles also get some attention during Gearbox’s E3 showcase. Norsfell and Gearbox announced earlier this week that co-op action survival RPG Tribes of Midgard will launch July 27 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam.

Registration for PC beta begins today
 Ubisoft’s 10-year-old Rocksmith franchise will become an “interactive music learning subscription service,” with its next entry, Rocksmith Plus. That’s according to an email that guitar maker Gibson let slip before Ubisoft could announce the video game at its E3 keynote on Saturday.
Per the marketing email, Ubisoft is apparently partnering with Gibson again, as the company’s Epiphone, Kramer, and Gibson models of acoustic, electric, or bass guitars are specifically mentioned as compatible. A closed beta on PC will also begin soon, with registration open today.

      A gif included with the email Gibson sent today.
  
Newcomers and returning musicians will find “an expansive library” of songs in Rocksmith Plus’s catalog. The program’s Riff Repeater, which can control a song’s speed to help players practice, also returns.
The first Rocksmith launched in 2011 but only for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That was followed two years later by Rocksmith 2014, considered a replacement rather than a sequel. That game launched for PC platforms in addition to the two consoles, and their successors.
Rocksmith 2014’s song library included 66 playable tracks on the disc, with more available as downloadable content. Saturday’s email did not specify how many songs would be available with the base game, or how deep the subscription service runs, or its pricing, for that matter.
Update: Ubisoft formally announced Rocksmith Plus at Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward event. The game still does not have a release date. During a presentation, Ubisoft said Rocksmith Plus players will also be able to use something called Rocksmith Workshop to create and add their own guitar arrangements to the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a currently unlisted ad on YouTube, Apple is promoting the versatility, portability, and power of the M1 iPad Pro in a fun musical inspired by The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World" soundtrack.






In the ad, which features the main character using an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil, multiple users can be seen struggling with their old PCs indoors while hoping that they can someday use an ‌iPad Pro‌ instead. The lyrics and soundtrack of the ad are completely based around The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World," but the visuals tell the majority of the story.



In one scene, an office employee using an old Windows PC can be seen looking out at a girl using an ‌iPad Pro‌ with the Magic Keyboard in a park while singing "up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun." The ad ends with all the characters singing "wish I could be, part of that world," referencing the world of using an ‌iPad Pro‌. 



The ad, uploaded on June 4, is currently unlisted on YouTube, meaning only those with a link will be able to watch it. It's unclear why Apple has decided not to make it public or if it plans to in the near future.

Halo, Starfield, Fable, and Game Pass news
 Microsoft’s E3 2021 press conference — called the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase — has a lot of ground to cover on June 13. The company has more to reveal for long-delayed Halo Infinite, including hopefully a finalized release date. It will also likely have updates to the Fable and Forza franchises, and Rare will likely have updates to Sea of Thieves and hopefully more to say on its mystical title Everwild. 
The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will stream on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and last for about 90 minutes. 
This is the first E3 since Microsoft acquired Bethesda, so the publisher and its studios will also take part in the press conference. Expect updates on long-awaited Starfield, and maybe a better look at The Elder Scrolls 6. Bethesda also promised updates to Fallout 76. 
Ahead of E3, Microsoft revealed plans to bring Xbox Game Pass and streaming games to internet-capable TVs and other stand-alone platforms, as well as bringing cloud based gaming to iOS devices. Microsoft also committed to bring at least one new first-party Xbox Game Studios game to Game Pass every quarter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.





In line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with "dramatically improved" speakers.



According to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.





The report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.



Prosser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.

These measures are the culmination of a 16-month antitrust investigation into tech companies practices that kicked off in 2019, and which saw Apple CEO Tim Cook testify in an antitrust hearing alongside Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.



At the conclusion of that hearing, which took place in July 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee leading the inquiry released a 450 page report with recommendations that have turned into the new antitrust bills that were proposed today.

Apple told Engadget the feature will work with stereo, 5.1, 7.1
and Dolby Atmos content. Whether you’re using a pair of AirPods
Pro or AirPods Max, the software that powers the feature will
widen the soundstage so that it seems like the entire room you’re
in is being filled with sound. When you sit down to watch a movie
or TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after
it detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while.
Once you get up to walk around, it will reactivate. Connecting
your AirPods to an Apple TV is also easy in this context. When
you’re near the device with your headphones, it will display a
popup that will allow you to quickly connect, and you won’t need
to dig into the settings menu.

Kena blends multiple genres into something new
 Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the first game from new studio Ember Lab. Its first trailer made it look like a cute romp through a forest overtaken by darkness, but after spending over an hour with a hands-on demo of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, I’ve learned it’s surprisingly difficult. Kena may look like the latest from Pixar, but the final mini-boss I encountered kicked my ass up, down, and sideways.
Kena: Bridge of Spirits has layers to it — some cute, others tough — and it made for a fun preview full of surprises.

Due to the global health crisis, Apple has held its typically in-person Worldwide Developers Conference in an all-digital format for the past two years. The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.



Unlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. 



One of the questions as part of this year's end of WWDC survey reads, "How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?" 



While not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community's outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple is contemplating the idea, and does plan to hold its first in-person event since the global health crisis began in the coming months.

This week you can pick up three weapons and an armor piece
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week.
Map: The Burnout
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock)
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. 
Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.]]></summary>

but, have you ever been at a friend’s amateur magic show, where
the magic show is not going quite as was hoped, and there’s a lot
of saying “hold on” and “wait, hang on” and “sorry” as they fail

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of neglect, Adobe is removing its free "Photoshop Mix" and "Photoshop Fix" apps from the App Store on June 21, 2021.





Adobe made the announcement in an update to its FAQ page for each of the apps. On the pages, Adobe says that both apps will be removed from the App Store on June 21, and advises users who used the apps to switch to using its "Photoshop Express Photo Editor," which requires either a monthly or yearly subscription for deeper photo editing.



Photoshop Mix was released on the App Store prior to when a fully-fledged version of Photoshop arrived on the iPad. It was Adobe's attempt to offer iPad users at the time some level of photo editing capabilities on the go. The app allows users to add text layers and "easily create and share professional multilayered images and designs in minutes." Photoshop Fix, on the other hand, is more tailored towards light touch-ups and refinements.



Photoshop Mix was last updated three years ago, while Photoshop Fix was updated two years with support for the iPhone X and newer screen ratio. Both apps will remain available for download on the App Store until June 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times:
As the Justice Department investigated who was behind leaks of
classified information early in the Trump administration, it took
a highly unusual step: Prosecutors subpoenaed Apple for data from
the accounts of at least two Democrats on the House Intelligence
Committee, aides and family members. One was a minor.
All told, the records of at least a dozen people tied to the
committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018, including those of
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, then the panel’s top
Democrat and now its chairman, according to committee officials
and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric
Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he
had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed. […]
Moreover, just as it did in investigating news organizations,
the Justice Department secured a gag order on Apple that expired
this year, according to a person familiar with the inquiry, so
lawmakers did not know they were being investigated until Apple
informed them last month.
Adam Schiff:
Trump repeatedly demanded the DOJ go after his political enemies.
It’s clear his demands didn’t fall on deaf ears.
This baseless investigation, while now closed, is yet another
example of Trump’s corrupt weaponization of justice.
And how much he imperiled our democracy.

Another Eklund to the Flyers?
 William Eklund is clearly head and shoulders above the other first round European prospects.
Playing in the SHL full time this past season (he played 20 SHL games in 2019-20), Eklund outpaced 2020 first round picks Alexander Holtz (who is also his teammate, and in fact, linemate) and Lucas Raymond, and delivered a solid postseason performance. Many consider Eklund to be the most skilled forward in terms of raw ability in the draft, and given my personal propensity to favor European prospects from men’s leagues, I would have to agree.

Ceramics will have their revenge
 FromSoftware’s Elden Ring finally came out of hiding on Thursday, after two years of deafening silence about the new adventure from Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin. It looked spectacular, in a next-gen Dark Souls kind of way, with its gigantic lightning-chucking dragons, double-jumping horses, a spider made of fingers, a brand-new Tall Lady to obsess over, and, of course, those pots.
Oh, those pots.
Elden Ring’s first gameplay trailer barely hinted at the existence of anthropomorphic pots, but they’ve becoming a quiet sensation since they were revealed. It seems everyone — there are dozens of us! — loves the little pot with arms and legs, and the slightly larger pot with arms and legs. In case you blacked …]]></summary>

One team’s questionable player is another team’s gold?
 The Flyers are in a precarious position heading into the offseason. As a team in need of significant changes while working with limited cap space, producing trades, handling free agency, and running the expansion draft in a way that will regain the confidence of the less than magnanimous fanbase won’t be easy. The aforementioned salary squeeze will make adding multiple no-brainer plugs for the gaps on this roster nearly impossible, so Chucky Two-Trades would be wise to pursue players that are underrated by the rest of the league. Whether that be to simply restructure the team’s salary or to provide cheap depth that’ll free up room to add a star is up to him.
With that in mind, below are som…]]></summary>

Security breach was reportedly performed via EA’s Slack
 A group of hackers has said they’ve broken into The Sims 4 and FIFA publisher Electronic Arts’ internal systems, according to a report from Vice. Hackers reportedly stole FIFA 21 source code — for the game and its matchmaking components — as well as source code for EA’s Frostbite engine.
A total of 780 GB of data stolen was stolen, Vice reported, including “proprietary EA frameworks and software development kits.” Hackers provided Vice with documents reportedly stolen in the hack, with information on PlayStation VR and other development tools.
“We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,” an EA representative told Vice. “No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident, we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation.”
Hackers reportedly accessed EA’s internal systems through workplace chat platform Slack, which plenty of companies use for online communication. The hackers told Vice they obtained access to an EA Slack channel using “stolen cookies” sold online for $10. (Cookies can be used to access login details.)
The hackers said they contacted an EA IT support person via Slack for a “multifactor authentication token” — claiming they’d lost their phone — to login to EA’s network. The hackers provided Vice with screenshots of the steps taken in accessing the information; Vice later confirmed the details of the hack with EA.
Contents of the hack have not been released online, at least just yet. Vice reported that the hackers are looking to sell the data.
EA has not responded to Polygon’s request for more information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple revealed that newer Macs will be gaining support for Adaptive-Sync external displays with variable refresh rates in macOS Monterey.





Apple says Adaptive-Sync displays will be supported on any Mac with Apple silicon, like the M1 chip, as well as "many" recent Intel-based Macs. When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences > Displays.



Adaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.



Macs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.

How the 21-year-old forward rose above expectations in a year of disappointments for the Flyers.
 After spending most of his draft plus two season playing in the NHL during the 2019-20 campaign, Joel Farabee broke out in a big way offensively for the Flyers in his 2021 sophomore campaign. To put it simply, Farabee was one of the best goal scorers in the NHL this season, and he just turned 21 at the end of February. 
Farabee led the Flyers in goal-scoring with 20, tying him for 30th league wide, equal to players like Nathan MacKinnon and David Pastrnak. Even more impressive is that 16 of those goals occurred at even strength, tying him for 6th in the league with Alex DeBrincat, Brad Marchand, Kirill Kaprizov, and Kyle Connor.

What I like about this is that no critic or professional interviewer would ask these questions (they are “bad” interview questions) and yet Ma answers them all generously and thoughtfully. It reminds me a little bit of when Vogue trained an AI program to interview Billie Eilish:
What I really loved hearing Billie say was that human interviewers often ask the same questions over and over, and she appreciated that the AI questions don’t have an agenda in the same way, they’re not trying to get anything from her.


Perhaps with interesting subjects who are game, having “good” interview questions maybe isn’t that important, particularly if they are repeated queried about the same topics in every interview.

Koch Media unveils new publishing label
 The next Payday game from Starbreeze Studios and a brand-new Painkiller are coming from a newly announced game publishing label called Prime Matter. Koch Media, which also owns publishing labels Deep Silver, Milestone, and Ravenscourt, announced Prime Matter on Thursday, revealing its first slate of games.
Koch Media calls Prime Matter a “premium label” that’s “dedicated to delivering brilliant immersive games.” That includes soon-to-be-released titles like Encased from Dark Crystal Games and King’s Bounty 2 by 1C Entertainment, both of which are due in the coming months. Then there are games that won’t be out for years, including Payday 3 and a new Painkiller game from Saber Interactive. 
In between, Prime Matter will publish Crossfire: Legion, a new real-time strategy game from Blackbird Interactive based on Smilegate’s Crossfire shooter series; GunGrave GORE, developer Iggymob’s anime-inspired third-person action shooter; and Kingdom Come Deliverance for Nintendo Switch. 
Prime Matter will also publish dark sci-fi action adventure Scars Above, futuristic FPS Codename Final Form, Lovecraftian horror action RPG Dolmen, Middle Ages-era action RPG The Last Oricru, story-driven fantasy adventure Echoes Of The End, and psychedelic horror adventure The Chant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, Safari has been completely redesigned with easier-to-reach controls in mind. Foremost is a new, compact tab bar that floats at the bottom of the screen when you're not inputting a URL address. Safari on iOS has also inherited the Start Page from macOS Big Sur, and you can now create tab groups to allow you to easily access them across devices. Let's take a closer look at how it all fits together.





The Start Page


First seen in macOS Big Sur, Safari's redesigned Start Page is where your Bookmarks, Favorites, Frequently Visited sites, Siri Suggestions, iCloud Tabs, Reading List, and Privacy Report all live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, Apple is expanding the features built into the stock Reminders app, which received a major overhaul in 2019. With the new updates shipping this fall, users will be able to create "Smart Lists" that corral reminders based on different filters, such as their location, due date, flag, priority, and more.





With the new functionality, users can create powerful lists that show reminders based only on several filters. For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.



For date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location. Users can also select the flag filter to show only flagged reminders and the priority filter.



‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and ‌macOS Monterey‌ are all currently in beta testing for members of the Apple Developer Program, with public beta versions set to be released soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has begun testing a major redesign to the iCloud Mail experience on the web, bringing its webmail service more in line with recent design changes made in macOS Big Sur.





The new design, currently in beta, reported first by 9to5mac, features a cleaner overall design and feel than the current public experience of ‌iCloud‌ Mail for the web. The current, soon-to-be previous version features thin typography, lighter colors, and design elements from iOS 7. Additionally, the new design allows users to compose emails in a smaller window in the middle of the screen, compared to opening an entirely new window.



As the new design is in beta testing alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS Monterey, and tvOS 15, it will likely be made available for all ‌iCloud‌ web users later this fall. Users wanting to try the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design can check out the beta website for iCloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nashville Chatter Class has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database pointing towards several unreleased iPhone 13 models that Apple will be launching in the fall.





Versions of iPhone running iOS 14 are listed with the model numbers A2628, A2630, A2634, A2635, A2640, A2643, and A2645. None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.



The EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.



Apple's 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end "Pro" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.



Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. See our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.

For example, Live Text allows you to capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call, or look up a location name in Maps to get directions. It also incorporates optical character recognition, so you can search for a picture of a handwritten note in your photos and save it as text. 



Live Text's content awareness extends to everything from QR codes to emails that appear in pictures, and this on-device intelligence feeds into Siri suggestions, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook has announced new features for its Messenger app, including a quick reply bar, QR codes, and new chat themes.





The new quick reply bar can be found in the Messenger media viewer, and aims to make it easier to chat about media posted by friends without needing to go back to the main chat thread.



Users can tap on a photo or video and send a response via the quick reply bar, which lives at the bottom of the screen, then swipe up to exit the fullscreen media viewer to return to the main chat thread.





Three new chat themes, which are available in both Messenger and Instagram in chat settings, let users add new twists to their chat thread backgrounds. The themes include Olivia Rodrdigo, World Oceans Day, and F9: Fast and Furious.



In addition, Facebook is adding QR codes and payment links for use with Facebook Pay, allowing users to make payments even if they're not on Facebook. 





To access a personal QR code and payment link, go to Messenger settings and tap "Facebook Pay." Users can share the payment link or allow friends to scan the QR code to send or request money.



The new features are rolling out now to Facebook Messenger, which is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

because of bad education. Maybe you do so because you’ve talked to
“experts” or watched youtube videos by charlatans that don’t know what

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Screen Times:
At the end of last week we detailed an update to the HBO Max Apple
TV app that introduced a whole host of issues, making the app
almost unusable. Check out our article for the very long
list. The issues were so bad that HBO exec Andy Forssell even
addressed them in a reply to John Siracusa on Twitter.
Thankfully, HBO has now issued a software update that reverts the
playback UI to the original tvOS version. I’ve verified this in
the 50.30.2 update and can confirm everything is back to normal
from skipping ahead to asking Siri ‘What did they say?’ and
everything in between.
You make a mistake, you fix it as fast as you can. Kudos, HBO Max tvOS team. 
Someone should send this to the new team behind the MLB app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At TED2020, Ethan Hawke gave a remote talk about the benefits of being creative. As someone who often struggles to find meaning in whatever it is I do here, this bit was especially good to hear:
Do you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?”
Or the inverse — something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance. We need it.

Kranz founded Canoo, a self-driving car startup that he left earlier this year. Prior to creating Canoo, Kranz helped to develop the i3 and i8 vehicles at BMW, where he was employed for 30 years.



According to Bloomberg, Kranz's hiring is a sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving vehicle that will rival Tesla. Kranz will report to Apple Car lead Doug Fields, who works under AI chief John Giannandrea.



Rumors about Apple's car project have picked up in recent months as Apple now appears to be looking for suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop the vehicle. There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai's Kia division, but it's not clear if that relationship has progressed.



Development on the ‌Apple Car‌ remains in the early stages, and Bloomberg suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.

Fight Deadites with three friends (and one frenemy)
 On Thursday at the Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at the gameplay of Evil Dead: The Game, an upcoming co-op shooter. Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.
One player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they’re tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It’ll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it’s controlled by a skilled player.
While moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It’ll also be necessary to actively manage your player character’s fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.
Evil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:
On the macOS Monterey features page, fine print indicates
that the following features require a Mac with the M1 chip,
including any MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac
model released since November 2020:
Portrait Mode blurred backgrounds in FaceTime videos
Live Text for copying and pasting, looking up, or translating
text within photos
An interactive 3D globe of Earth in the Maps app
More detailed maps in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles,
New York, and London in the Maps app
Text-to-speech in more languages, including Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian, and Finnish
On-device keyboard dictation that performs all processing
completely offline
Unlimited keyboard dictation (previously limited to 60 seconds
per instance)
Apple has not explained why any of these features are not
available on Intel-based Macs. For what it’s worth, Google Earth
has long offered an interactive 3D globe of the Earth on
Intel-based Macs both on the web and in an app.
I don’t think Apple has to explain. These features all clearly are built on code that uses features exclusive to Apple Silicon. E.g. for Portrait Mode in FaceTime, it uses the M1 imaging pipeline — the same thing that makes all FaceTime footage on the M1 MacBooks look so much better than on any Intel MacBook, even though the camera hardware is the same. The speech/dictation features on this list are surely using the Neural Engine, something Intel Macs don’t even have.

The trailer shows a tragic backdrop to a tranquil scene
 Planet of Lana is a beautiful new cinematic puzzle adventure game from the Swedish indie studio, Wishfully. It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.
The story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana’s sister. Their planet — which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature — has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.
What’s interesting though, is that this game expressly isn’t about war or conflict. “This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet –and the journey to keep it that way,” a description from the developers said. 
The world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. 
A release shared that the visual style “combines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.” The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, “allowing its incredible artwork to come to life.”
In the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There’s a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. 
However, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It’s a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. 
Planet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.]]></summary>

FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022
 Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.
The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.
Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses!
Check out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.


The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.
Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.”
FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.
Elden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-06-10T19:44:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good overview of one of this week’s biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:
Apple’s iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it
routes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address
from the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever
manages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is
generally just one server between you and the website you’re
visiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ↔︎ VPN
Server ↔︎ Website. Private Relay adds another server to the
mix, which ensures that no one in the chain — not even Apple — can see the whole picture: You ↔︎ Apple’s Ingress Server ↔︎
Content Provider’s Egress Server ↔︎ Website.
This is, as Apple calls it in their “Get Ready for iCloud Private
Relay” WWDC Session on the topic, “Privacy by Design.”
Apple made specific mention that while the “Ingress Proxy” servers
are run by Apple, the “Egress Proxy” (aka the server which
communicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by
Apple and is under the control of “a (trusted) content provider”.
This means that Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting,
and the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.
I’m using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn’t seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail’s new tracker privacy protection), even though I’ve got an Apple One family account. I “fixed” that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1 — just figured I’d mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.

Less Masquerade, more mass murdering
 Developer Sharkmob is creating a new game in the Vampire: the Masquerade universe, but it’s a far cry from the dialogue-heavy RPGs that are common to the franchise. Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.
We saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. 
There’s an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.
Bloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021. Players can sign up for a closed alpha test on the game’s official website.]]></summary>

‘We cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with’
 CD Projekt, the parent company of the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, announced Thursday that the data breach it suffered earlier this year is potentially more damaging than originally thought. The news was announced during the high-profile industry premieres showcased during the Summer Game Fest, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
In early February CD Project announced that it was targeted by a “cyber attack” and that data, including video game source code, had been stolen. At the time, the Polish company said that “certain data” was being ransomed by unknown parties. It did not confirm the type of data stolen.

 At Summer Game Fest on Thursday, actor Jeff Goldblum announced Frontier’s newest game, Jurassic World Evolution 2.

Goldblum had the honor of announcing the release, since he will play Dr. Ian Malcolm in the upcoming game, and has played Dr. Malcolm in the Jurassic Park film canon, and in games like The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. He will be joined by the actress Bryce Dallas Howard who will play Claire Dearing in the game.

 Chet Faliszek won’t begrudge you for thinking his newest game sounds a lot like one of his old ones. The Anacrusis, coming this fall to Windows PC via Steam, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Xbox Game Pass, is a cooperative shooter in which four players must fight together against a relentless horde of mindless monsters. 
So, that’s basically Left 4 Dead, right?

Plus, two new roles: the Sherriff and the Scientist
 Among Us’ next update got partially revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream on Thursday, and it includes a new map, new colors and cosmetics, new roles, and a Hide and Seek mode. There’s no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.
The new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We’ll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.
There are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.
Among Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It’s a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it’s still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.]]></summary>

The new trailer also teases another update for Verdansk
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting another new season, but there won’t be a whole new map this time. We got a preview of the season’s changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.
The largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. 
Meanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what’s next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn’t clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. 
Call of Duty: Warzone’s previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo. While this patch certainly seems to be smaller than that, it does seem like it will have plenty of new additions to the game for players to check out over the next few months. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone season 4 will start on June 17.]]></summary>

Much of this tracking is facilitated by remote images that load when viewing an email, and some of it is even sneakier, with advertisers using invisible tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are hidden graphics that you might not see in an email, but your email client loads them, allowing senders to gather data from you. Senders can see that you've opened an email get other information, such as your IP address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I learned about bonsai trees as a kid, I’ve been fascinated with them. In my 20s, my girlfriend bought me a juniper bonsai for my birthday. I was really excited to see what I could do with it, but it was dead in a month and a half, forever dimming my enthusiasm for ever practicing bonsai myself. But I still love observing the process and seeing the results, so I’ve enjoyed watching Bucky Barnes’1 Bonsai Releaf videos. His latest video (above) documents the year-long transformation of a Japanese larch tree he purchased for £30 into something that looks like it’s been majestically clinging to a windswept cliff for hundreds of years.
Observation, healing, experimentation, growth, making irreversible choices — so many lovely little themes, lessons, and moments in this video. At one point, well into the process, he clips off most of a long branch and I exclaimed “Oh my God!” out loud. I guess I still need to work on letting go of attachments.

No, not that one.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced that following beta testing for a small group of users, it plans to launch its xCloud game streaming service on Apple devices via Safari "in the next few weeks."





Microsoft has been attempting to launch its game streaming service, which allows users to stream games from the cloud rather than store them locally on the device, on Apple's platforms for some time. Microsoft and Apple got into a heated public argument last year over App Store guidelines that rejected apps such as xCloud from being available on the ‌App Store‌. Apple eventually changed the policy, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. 



Microsoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on iPhone and iPad. Alongside xCloud on Safari, the streaming service will also launch on Edge and Chrome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One small but useful new feature introduced in iOS 15 is the ability for customers to request refunds for in-app purchases directly within an app, rather than having to use the Report a Problem page on Apple's website.





Apple has introduced a new StoreKit API that allows developers to implement a "Request a Refund" option within their apps. Users can tap on this option, select a specific in-app purchase, identify the issue that prompted the refund request, and tap the Request Refund button. Once the request is submitted, customers will receive an email from Apple with an update on the status of their refund within 48 hours.



When requesting a refund within an app, customers still have the option to visit the Report a Problem page on Apple's website to check the status of claims.



‌iOS 15‌ is available now in beta for developers, and will be publicly released in the fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On iOS and iPadOS 15, Apple is adding new functionality to WidgetKit, introduced last year, that will allow developers to classify information deemed as sensitive in their widgets, meaning that specific information will only become viewable on the lock screen when the user unlocks their device.





iOS 14 introduced completely redesigned ‌widgets‌ for the lock screen and Home Screen. While there are no major changes to WidgetKit this year, the new password-protected feature may be welcomed by apps that feature ‌widgets‌ with sensitive information, such as health and banking information. Widgets are accessible on the lock screen by swiping left to Today View.



Related to ‌widgets‌ on iOS 15 is new functionality for Smart Stacks. Smart Stacks allows users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to be shown depending on factors such as time of day, location, and more. 



On ‌iOS 15‌, the system can now automatically add widgets to Smart Stacks that it believes are relevant. The feature called Widget Suggestions is a new way for users to discover ‌widgets‌ they may not have known existed. Developers interested in learning more about the changes in ‌iOS 15‌ can check out this WWDC session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Apple acquired the weather app Dark Sky, and shortly after its purchase, Apple shut down the app for Android. Despite the revamped iOS 15 Weather app taking heavy inspiration from Dark Sky, the weather's app standalone iOS app, web app, and API will remain available until the end of next year, compared to the end of this year, as previously planned.





Dark Sky announced in an update to its blog that "support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022," and that the iOS and web app will also remain available until the end of next year. Dark Sky had originally planned to shut down its web app alongside the closure of its Android application; however, that was delayed indefinitely.



A number of popular third-party iOS weather apps have relied on the Dark Sky API over the years, and those apps will be able to continue functioning through next year without needing to migrate to a new provider.



The revamped Weather app on iOS 15 includes several features in which Apple is taking clear inspiration and value from its Dark Sky purchase. Alongside a fresh new design, ‌iOS 15‌ includes live weather notifications, graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of WWDC this week, Apple introduced a new MailKit framework for macOS Monterey that enables developers to create Mail app extensions that block content, perform message and composing actions, and help with security.





There will be four main categories of Mail app extensions, according to Apple:
Compose: Extensions that provide new workflows when composing emails


Actions: Extensions that apply custom rules to incoming emails, such as an email being color coded, moved to a separate inbox, marked as read, or flagged


Content Blocking: Extensions that serve as WebKit content blockers for emails based on specific criteria in an email's HTML code


Message Security: Extensions that sign, encrypt, and decrypt emails when sending and receiving mail, with signed and encrypted icons below emails
Xcode 13, available in beta, includes a template for developers looking to create Mail app extensions on the Mac. The extensions can be built into existing Mac apps and can also be distributed through the Mac App Store, according to a WWDC session about MailKit, which is available on macOS only and not iOS or iPadOS.



In the WWDC session, Apple indicated that older Mail app plug-ins will stop functioning in an unspecified future macOS release.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July.

The new reminder, first spotted by The Verge, is part of a wider assortment of changes and new features coming to ‌FaceTime‌ with the release of ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this fall. Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.



Apple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, including those on Android and Windows, brand-new SharePlay functionality, and more.

A winger, at long last!
 As the draft board rolls on, we’ve finally got our first winger entering the mix, would you look at that!
It was something of a strange season for Guenther, in truth—because of COVID restrictions and the WHL starting their season late, he didn’t really play a whole lot. He started with Sherwood Park of the AJHL on a loan, got in four games with them before returning to Edmonton, and then played 12 games with them. It wasn’t a whole lot of playing time to work with, but Guenther sure made the most of it, cruising with a cool 2 points per game pace in the WHL, and that’s a performance that’s certainly turned a number of heads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple says that starting at a future date, it will offer members of the Apple Developer Program access to beta versions of AirPods Pro firmware updates before they're released and shipped to the public.





Apple made the announcement for developers on the downloads page where beta versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS are available. According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. 

Pre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date. This will allow development of features on iOS and macOS for AirPods as well as enable new features, including Conversation Boost (beam forming) and Ambient Noise Reduction (noise suppressor).
Currently, Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, and AirPods Max, although there's no reliable way to manually update the devices. Instead, they're updated automatically when connected to power and nearby a paired iPhone or iPad with an internet connection. 



It remains unclear how Apple will provide beta versions for ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware. Presumably, Apple will provide a profile for developers to download that automatically installs and updates the ‌AirPods Pro‌ when there's a new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today launched a promotion in Canada that offers a $75 Apple Store gift card with the purchase of a new iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini through June 28. The offer does not apply to the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max.





The offer is valid in Canada at physical Apple Store locations, through Apple's online store, in the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE for iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini purchases made between June 10 and June 28. Purchases made with carrier financing are eligible, with full terms and conditions outlined on Apple's website.



Apple's online store went down earlier today in Canada, likely in relation to this promotion launching. The offer does not appear to be available in the United States or other countries at this time, nor does it apply to any other products.



Apple released the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in October 2020, and introduced a purple color option for the devices in late April.

Users have always been able to locate their ‌AirPods‌ through the ‌Find My‌ app within Bluetooth range. Now, with ‌iOS 15‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ can tap into the ‌Find My‌ network to relay their approximate location, even if they're out of Bluetooth range from the owner. ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will still need to be within close proximity to a ‌Find My‌ device, such as an iPhone, however. 



‌Find My‌ allows devices to crowdsource the location of other ‌Find My‌ devices, meaning even if they're relatively far away, ‌Find My‌ should be able to provide an approximate location.

Use the ‌Find My‌ network to get an approximate location of your missing ‌AirPods Pro‌ or ‌AirPods Max‌. This will help you get within Bluetooth range so you can play a sound and locate them.
Beats headphones, also owned by Apple, added support for ‌Find My‌ earlier this year. ‌Find My‌ also gained other new features in ‌iOS 15‌, including brand new separation alerts that notify users if a ‌Find My‌ compatible device is left behind, a brand new Find My widget for the Home Screen, and the ability for ‌Find My‌ to locate an ‌iPhone‌ even if its low on battery, or completely turned off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.





Trump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.



However, Trump's bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. 



Biden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.



Going forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an "evidence-based approach" when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those "in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary."



A separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains "very concerned" about the data risks of TikTok users.



Biden's order says collecting of data from Americans "threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information," and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that "pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. 





The original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. 





Another interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. 



Along with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. 





The prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 in 2015.



We haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‌iPod touch‌ in the works. The current seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Heath, for The Verge:
Facebook is taking a novel approach to its first smartwatch, which the company hasn’t confirmed publicly but currently plans to debut next summer. The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, The Verge has learned.
A camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission.
Sounds right. A tiny concealable camera to take surreptitious photos that upload to Facebook sounds exactly like something Mark Zuckerberg came up with himself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This chart caught my eye yesterday:

It’s from Robin Dunbar’s recent book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our Most Important Relationships. You might recall the author’s name from his concept of Dunbar’s number:1 that on average people can maintain about 150 friendships with others, a limit that is determined by human brain size and function. The chart is a more detailed version of the concept: it shows, roughly, the number of people we can have meaningful relationships with at various levels of intimacy. Dunbar explains in this Atlantic interview:
The innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your romantic relationships. The next layer of five is your shoulders-to-cry-on friendships. They are the ones who will drop everything to support us when our wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:
From its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America’s pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation’s top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic’s collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (“If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,” Walensky said.)


The pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that’ll change for the better in the future.

A Clarke! (but not that one).
 We’re closing out the top-3 in our draft board, and we’ve got another defenseman on deck!
Coming in at third overall is Brandt Clarke, and it’s been a bit of a weird year for him. Clarke played his 2019-20 season with the Barrie Colts of the OHL, but because of the COVID restrictions in Ontario, the OHL didn’t play a season at all this year. So, to make sure he was still able to get some games in, Clarke shipped off to Slovakia for 26 games with Nove Zamky. Unconventional? Yes. But it was a very good season, all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world’s best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double — that’s three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what’s going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air — like absurdly and spectacularly high — and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing — it’s like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.
In reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: “How is that even humanly possible?” As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.

this week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy doing these quick hits on CNBC. I get on, I get a few questions, I answer as best I can, and I’m out. Two tidbits on my spot today:
It seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is a new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.


Another question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:
One of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam
Levine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he
was like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song
and he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do
with this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this
evolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with
this, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to
do this.
So we went after the labels and are going to the artists and
educating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because
we have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a
simple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through
this software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This
requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit
back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the
right things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s
worth it. […]
To me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for
music what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch
television that’s not in HD?
One of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take
an old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on
low-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things
were recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back
to a lot of the songs and be able to do this.
The article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Circa 1842, ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige released an 11-print series revealing the secrets of shadow puppetry performances. From the description of one of these woodblock prints held in the collection at The Minneapolis Institute of Art:
As comic entertainment, shadow performances were among the many diversions, including music and dance, offered at teahouse parties during the Edo period. In the eleven-print series Improvised Shadow Performances, Hiroshige depicted figures making shadows on shōji screens by contorting their bodies. The images demonstrate how to create ingenious shadows and could easily have been used as a how-to guide for clever shadow making.


You can find more of Hiroshige’s shadow prints at Ukiyo-e.org. (via colossal)

Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Illustrator and InDesign
will run natively on Apple Silicon devices. While users have been
able to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,
today’s development means a considerable boost in speed and
performance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent
increase in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent
improvement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.
Specific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster. Just from porting to run natively on Apple Silicon.
And we’ve only seen Apple’s consumer Apple Silicon chips for Mac.

A little more Wolverines love around here. 
 We’re rolling right along with our draft board, and coming in at second overall is another member of the University of Michigan’s stellar freshman class, in Matthew Beniers.
If you caught any of this year’s World Juniors, this is probably a name that you’re familiar with. Beniers picked up three points in seven games with the United States on their way to scooping up a goal medal, and while all eyes were on many of the big names on that team—2019 draftees like Cam York, Alex Turcotte, and Trevor Zegras—Beniers stood out for his motor that was helping to drive success for the US’s depth lines. 
His international success was just the cherry on top of a really solid season with Michigan, which saw him sco…]]></summary>

There’s a lot of directions the Flyers could go, which do you want to see them go in?
 Sign Dougie Hamilton? Trade for Seth Jones? Bring in some grit to the forward core? Blow up the core? Stand pat?  These are all options that have been floated around this team since it became obvious they were out of playoff contention. This is a huge off-season for Chuck Fletcher and the Philadelphia Flyers, who need to decide what they want this team to look like.
We as the fans need to know before games begin later this year to kick off the 2021-22 season, what is the Flyers identity? Before COVID shut the NHL season down in March 2020, the Flyers had a clear idea of what the team was. They were outstanding defensively, out-worked teams in the corne…]]></summary>

working on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:
If you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?
Of course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into
bugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I
figured them out!)
I got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to
talk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this
post, I’ll just try to classify them.
Here are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible
to understand. Each one of them has a bunch of sub variants which are bolded below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking of playing the lottery, Philadelphia is getting in on the lottery-for-getting-vaccinated trend:
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced today the launch of “Philly Vax Sweepstakes,” a series of three citywide drawings designed to give Philadelphians extra motivation to get their vaccination against COVID-19 as the city fully reopens this summer.
A total of 36 vaccinated Philadelphians will win cash prizes up to $50,000, totaling nearly $400,000 in giveaways. In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.
I really do love the idea of these lotteries and giveaway promotions. It’s innumeracy that leads some people to grossly miscalculate the risks vs. rewards of getting vaccinated, and it’s innumeracy that leads people to play lotteries. Sweepstakes for getting vaccinated put innumeracy to work.

America experienced 246 years of slavery before it was officially ended with the passage of the 13th Amendment. That was followed by decades of legal segregation and oppression under Jim Crow, followed by a period of willful blindness and denial. A tourist from a foreign land might well conclude that the Confederacy had actually won the Civil War, based on the number of monuments, buildings and boulevards still named for heroes of its defeated army. The real truth of our shared history was a casualty of that war and, like any wound left untended, the results can be catastrophic.
A full accounting of slavery is one of terror and trauma, and for decades the na…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a 3-minute clip of The Concert (or The Perils of Everybody) by choreographer Jerome Robbins, in which the dancers are intentionally, and comically, out of sync. You can see why it’s colloquially called the Mistake Waltz. Open Culture’s Ayun Halliday has collected several more of these performances in this post.
It must be incredibly hard for dancers to execute this piece, to deliberately perform out of step with the music and their fellow performers after a lifetime of practice & performance designed to drill the opposite instinct to them. Bravo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Filmmaker Morgan Neville (who did the Fred Rogers doc Won’t You Be My Neighbor?) has directed a documentary about Anthony Bourdain called Roadrunner that opens in theaters on July 16.
It’s not where you go. It’s what you leave behind… Chef, writer, adventurer, provocateur: Anthony Bourdain lived his life unabashedly. Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at how an anonymous chef became a world-renowned cultural icon. From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet From Stardom, Won’t You Be My Neighbor?), this unflinching look at Bourdain reverberates with his presence, in his own voice and in the way he indelibly impacted the world around him.


This trailer makes me want to buy a movie ticket — and about 10 plane tickets. So looking forward to this. I need more unabashed living in my life.

Over the weekend, Snyder published a short piece about what he believes will happen as a result of the 1/6 insurrection and the Republicans’ ongoing effort to push their Big Lie about election fraud — basically the end of democracy in America.

It’s not about giving in to every little demand being lobbed at them. It’s about collecting information, determining what the right thing to do is, and doing it the Apple Way. When Apple does that and does it right, the results are fantastic.
Let’s hope we see some of that Apple shine through this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good column (and video) from Joanna Stern on Apple’s “walled garden”. The people who use the term “walled garden” in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that’s not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice — and the walls and gates can be what makes them nice. That’s been a recurring theme in the testimony from Apple executives in the Epic trial. Asked about rules and limits on iOS that Epic presents as nefarious — nothing but tricks to lock users in — Apple witnesses typically responded by presenting them as features. That iOS is wildly popular not despite the “walls”, but because of them.
It’s a trade-off, for example, that anything you can install on iOS can be trivially uninstalled just by deleting the app icon from your home screen. The downside is that iOS doesn’t support any third-party ideas that would require system-level background agents or extensions. I can name dozens of great Mac utilities that I’d enjoy, if not love, on iOS, but which can’t exist on iOS because of the rules. That sucks. But those same rules mean there’s no way to mess up your iPhone or iPad by installing something you don’t like and which is difficult to uninstall. That’s great.
Better than “walled garden”, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They’re fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They’re also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks. Public parks are great too — in very different ways. We should have great public parks, and we should have great open computing platforms. But not every park should necessarily be public, and not every closed computing platform would be better off open.

The bottom line is, the viewing experience in the HBO Max app is
now horrifically bad and almost unusable unless you’re planning
just to play and pause. If you need to do anything else, don’t get
your hopes up.
The fact that they completely broke fast-forwarding and rewinding is mind boggling. Those aren’t exactly obscure power user features. Just use the standard video player. I don’t know how this update shipped. (The worst part is, my wife and I are hooked on Mare of Easttown, and have been binging it all week. Really sucks not being able to do anything except play and pause.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1,400 words to say they’d prefer a policy that allows teams within Apple to determine their own remote work policies. Good communication is to the point, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel “unheard”. It’s hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ✊🍆 vibes. The “formal requests” at the end about employees with disabilities and the “environmental impact of returning to onsite [sic] in-person work” are such transparent pandering. (I have never once heard of Apple not doing whatever it takes not only to accommodate employees with any disability, but to make them feel welcome.)
And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days remote is a huge change for Apple.
Given that these letters keep leaking to Zoe Schiffer at The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple is that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot of people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a mistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack. Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on site” policy wasn’t a request for comments — it was a decision — and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.

We are today announcing new enforcement protocols to be applied in
exceptional cases such as this, and we are confirming the
time-bound penalty consistent with those protocols which we are
applying to Mr. Trump’s accounts. Given the gravity of the
circumstances that led to Mr. Trump’s suspension, we believe his
actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit
the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols.
We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the
date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.
As part of this decision, Facebook is rescinding the special privileges heretofore extended to world leaders and political figures that largely exempted them from Facebook’s content policies on the grounds of “newsworthiness”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free Mac utility from Andreas Hegenberg, developer of BetterTouchTool and BetterSnapTool:
KeyboardCleanTool is a super simple little tool which blocks all
Keyboard and TouchBar input.
In 2011 Apple rejected the app for the Mac App Store because
apparently it’s “not useful”, however I often use it to clean my
MacBook keyboard without producing annoying input.
I have also heard of people who use it to let their toddlers
pretend they work on a computer.
The app has been around for 10 years, but I don’t recall hearing of it before. It’s more useful than ever today, because modern MacBooks will power on with the press of any key on the keyboard. It used to be that you could wipe your keyboard clean while powered down, but Apple changed that a few years ago, apparently because a fair number of users were confused how to turn their MacBooks on, now that the power/Touch ID button has no power icon. (Joanna Stern and I talked about this on the most recent episode of The Talk Show.)
KeyboardCleanTool is a great solution.
Update: See also: Shaun Inman’s Little Fingers, a similarly-purposed utility that also blocks input from the mouse/trackpad.

Bing, the search engine owned by Microsoft, is not displaying
image results for a search for “Tank man,” even when searching
from the United States. The apparent censorship comes on the
anniversary of China’s violent crackdown on protests in Tiananmen
Square in 1989. […]
Bing displays ordinary, non-image search results for “tank man”
when searching from a U.S. IP address; the issue only impacts the
Images and Videos tabs. Google, for its part, displays both when
connecting from the same IP address.
Motherboard verified that the issue also impacts image searches on
Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, which both use Bing. Neither company
immediately responded to a request for comment.
George Orwell, 1984:
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the
right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written
messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the
side wall, within easy reach of Winston’s arm, a large oblong slit
protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of
waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of
thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at
short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were
nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due
for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying
about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest
memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on
a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden
somewhere in the recesses of the building.

        <updated>2021-06-04T19:07:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Moren, writing at Macworld:
Multitasking on the iPad is, to put it generously, a mess. Split
View and Slide Over, first introduced in 2015’s iOS 9 and refined
a couple of times over the years, have always had the feeling of a
band-aid slapped over a mortal wound. Their limitations (like the
dance of getting an app that’s not in your dock into Split View)
and awkward gestures (how many times have you activated Slide Over
when you meant to simply swipe) feel cumbersome, especially
compared to the multitasking we’ve always had on the Mac.
So I’m hoping that 2021 is the year that Apple finally cracks
multitasking on the iPad. I’m not sure exactly what that looks
like; there are those who argue for the wholesale transplant of
macOS’s windowing system, but that seems as though it might be
another imprecise fit borne out of convenience rather than actual
appropriateness. Fundamentally, though, the iPad has always been
built around the idea of one app on the screen at any time, and
it’s clear that simply won’t do in a world where people expect to
be able to run multiple apps at once.
It’s amazing how often I make a slide-over Safari “window” on iPad without wanting to. And then I’m stuck with a new Safari instance with no actual tabs. You can get into Slide Over inadvertently, and if you do, it’s hard to undo it. It’s like instantly creating detritus you need to clean up. iPadOS is the only GUI system I’m aware of that has “windows” that don’t have close buttons.
My wife uses her iPad Pro more than any other device. She loves it. But Slide Over was driving her nuts until I showed her how to turn it off. “Why is that on by default?” she asked.

not everyone who is vaccinated will develop antibodies, and many
of those who don’t are at high risk for the most severe
consequences of Covid-19. As a kidney transplant recipient, I am
one of those people.
Until recently, immunocompromised people were excluded from
studies of the mRNA vaccines for Covid-19, but data from clinical
trials is beginning to emerge. A study of fully vaccinated kidney
transplant patients published in April by researchers at New York-
Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center
revealed that 75 percent of kidney transplant patients
studied did not develop measurable immunity after both doses of
the vaccine. A second stud…]]></summary>

The United States is roughly on track to meet President Biden’s
goal of getting at least one Covid-19 shot into the arms of 70
percent of adults by July 4 — if the current vaccination pace
holds. But demand for vaccines has decreased in much of the
country in recent weeks, and the promising national numbers (about
63 percent of adults have received at least one shot) do not
reflect the uneven rates among states.
Even if the country as a whole reaches the national target, at
least 30 states probably will not. And a handful are unlikely to
reach the 70 percent mark before the end of the year, a New York
Times analysis shows, potentially prolonging the pandemic.
On the bright side, even our worst-performing states on COVID vaccination rates — Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming,…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-secf60513daa/1/web/1"/>
        <updated>2021-06-04T15:43:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple’s Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the
biometric sensor; it doesn’t store biometric templates, perform
biometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,
having to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).
The Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be
securely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be
used, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and
matching operations and enforces security policies in the same way
it would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the
pairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
that is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the
user if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely
paired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure
pairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
keyboards.
So I was wrong in my article on “secure intent” this week — the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does not contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it’s paired. But this contradicts the Platform Security page about “secure intent”, which states: “the connection is a physical link — from a physical button to the Secure Enclave”. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac’s Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are
compatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch
ID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the
Secure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match — and
vice versa.
I did not know this — nifty.

United Airlines aims to bring back supersonic travel before the
decade is over with a plane that is currently just an artist’s
drawing — even the prototype hasn’t flown yet.
The airline said Thursday that it plans to buy 15 jets from Boom
Supersonic with an option for 35 more once the start-up company
designs a plane that flies faster than the speed of sound while
meeting safety and environmental standards.
United hopes to carry passengers on the plane in 2029. The airline
said the plane will reduce flights between London and the New York
area to just 3.5 hours and make Tokyo only 6 hours from San
Francisco.
The last commercial supersonic flight was in 2003, when the Concordes were grounded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Brooklyn company called Pliant Energy Systems has developed a prototype of an amphibious robot that can swim, skate, slither, and crawl through water and over all different kinds of terrain. The secret is an undulating propulsion system that can modified on the fly to adapt to different conditions.
Velox can use several modes of locomotion found in the animal kingdom using just one pair of “fins”. These fins are best described as four-dimensional objects with a hyperbolic geometry that allows the robot to swim like a ray, crawl like a millipede, jet like a squid, and slide like a snake.
A craft equipped with this system has unprecedented freedom to travel through a range of environments in a single mission. As an underwater vehicle, the robot’s ability to instantly reverse direction and do quick turns make it ideal for task such as coral reef inspection or dragon fish hunting where a craft must rapidly maneuver to look around and between objects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josephine Wolff, writing for Slate:
By all means, opt out of Amazon Sidewalk if anything about
this program makes you uncomfortable or if (despite already owning
a Ring or Echo) you don’t trust the company enough to share a
little of your home network with your neighbors safely. You’re
under no obligation to participate in this mesh networking
experiment, and it probably would have made more sense for Amazon
to at least launch the program with an opt-in model that gave
people more time to learn about how it works and whether they want
to be involved.
But if you’re just learning about mesh networks for the first time
and aren’t sure what to think, or whether this is something to be
very worried about, I really don’t think it is. If you’ve already
reconciled yourself to the privacy implications of owning an Echo
or a Ring, the additional privacy and security drawbacks of
participating in Sidewalk seem very limited and the benefits are
potentially considerable, for you and for everyone around you.
I like this take. The thing to consider is whether you trust Echo and Ring devices with your privacy. If you do, you might as well participate in Sidewalk. It’s not that different, conceptually, from Apple’s Find My network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Krebs:
Fake, positive reviews have infiltrated nearly every corner of
life online these days, confusing consumers while offering an
unwelcome advantage to fraudsters and sub-par products everywhere.
Happily, identifying and tracking these fake reviewer accounts is
often the easiest way to spot scams. Here’s the story of how bogus
reviews on a counterfeit Microsoft Authenticator browser extension
exposed dozens of other extensions that siphoned personal and
financial data.
After hearing from a reader about a phony Microsoft Authenticator
extension that appeared on the Google Chrome Store,
KrebsOnSecurity began looking at the profile of the account that
created it. There were a total of five reviews on the extension
before it was removed: Three Google users gave it one star,
warning people to stay far away from it; but two of the reviewers
awarded it between three and four stars.
Fraudulent reviews are a scourge. Apple’s App Store is riddled with them — I’m not sure I’ve seen a single story about a scammy app in the App Store that didn’t have a bunch of 5-star reviews. Amazon product pages are riddled with fake reviews too. There’s a huge cottage industry in paying for fake reviews in any online forum where reviews can come from anyone.
I don’t know what the answer is. Users think they like reading reviews from other users, but they have no idea how utterly untrustworthy unverified reviews are. There’d be outrage if Apple or Amazon simply pulled the plug on user-submitted reviews, or wiped the slate clean by nuking existing reviews and starting over with some sort of “verified reviewer” system. But the status quo is a cesspool of scammy reviews that many users believe they can trust. It’s a mess.

In this short film, we meet three Foley artists who work at Footsteps Studios, a custom designed facility in rural Ontario that includes a massive warehouse of props that can make any sound you can dream of. This video is full of lovely little moments and details — recommended.

Today we’re pleased to announce that Stack Overflow is joining
Prosus. Prosus is an investment and holding company, which
means that the most important part of this announcement is that
Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the
exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to
the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t
expect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business
of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance,
and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in
place: we just have different owners now.
This is, in some ways, the best possible outcome. Stack Overflow
stays independent. The company has plenty of cash on hand to
expand and deliver more features and fix the old broken ones.
Stack Overflow is far from perfect — what isn’t? — but the world would be a far worse place without it, so here’s to hoping that Prosus is a good steward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Our Favourite Uses of Typography in Watches:
Good typography should be almost unnoticeable. Blending seamlessly into the rest of the design, it should tell you everything you need to know, without you being aware of it. Despite the many restrictions that are applied to dial layout, the creativity that can be seen in typography across horology is quite staggering. To put it simply, typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. As the dial is the main point of interaction with a watch, it is arguably one of its most important parts, and certainly one that can produce the most emotion. This is why typeface can play such a vital, yet subtle, role in how we experience and feel about a certain piece.

In 2016, Luke Aikins became the first person to intentionally jump and land without the aid of a parachute or wingsuit — check out the video above to see how he does it. At one point, his heart rate is displayed on the screen and I’m certain that mine was in the same ballpark just before he landed. I recommend you also watch a video of the jump narrated by Aikins as he talks through what’s happening before, during, and after the jump.
See also Gary Connery’s 2012 jump — he fell 2400 feet from a helicopter and landed on a huge pile of cardboard boxes with the aid of a wingsuit, which slowed his vertical velocity to about 15 mph.
FYI: The jump height of 25,000 feet seems impressive (and it’s probably trickier hitting the target from higher up) but in terms of speed, about 1500 feet is sufficient for a freefalling human in the spread-eagle position to reach their maximum (terminal) velocity of ~120 mph. Anything over 1500 feet, about half the height of El Capitan’s granite face, doesn’t add any additional speed. (via @mikeindustries)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Snell, in his wishlist for Mac news at next week’s WWDC:
One feature that the Mac desperately needs from iPadOS is, believe
it or not, Shortcuts. I’ve written elsewhere about this,
but essentially it’s easier for me to create automations for many
tasks on iOS than it is on macOS — and it shouldn’t be that way.
Shortcuts fulfills the promise of Automator in ways that Automator
never did, and while it’s got a lot of room to grow, it’s clearly
the future of automation on Apple’s platforms. Add in actions that
can run AppleScript, Automator workflows, and shell scripts, and
we’ll really have something.
I’ve gotten more into Shortcuts in the last few months, and I really hope this happens. I just wonder how Shortcuts on Mac could offer actions for things that aren’t possible on iOS, like Snell’s suggestion for being able to run AppleScript and shell scripts. I suppose they’d just generate an error on iOS, and you could use them in a cross-platform shortcut by conditionally testing whether the shortcut is running on MacOS — pretty much how it works now when you have a shortcut containing actions that require a third-party app to be installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by space-saving flat-packed furniture, scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a technique for making pasta shapes that start out flat when dry but “morph” into their final 3D shapes when cooked. The secret is stamping different groove patterns into the pasta dough.
The solution: something Wang, Yao, and their co-authors term “groove-based transient morphing.” They found that stamping flat pasta sheets with different groove patterns enabled them to control the final pasta shape after cooking. According to the authors, the grooves increase how long it takes to cook that part of the pasta. So those areas expand less than the smooth areas, giving rise to many different shapes.
The team found that the pasta reached its maximum bending angle after about 12 minutes and retained this angle for around 20 minutes before it began to bend back. The researchers were able to produce simple helical and cone shapes, as well as more complex saddles and twists (the latter achieved by introducing double-sided grooves).


I am assuming those grooves would also aid in holding sauce better, a topic we’ve delved into recently. You can read the full research paper on the morphing pasta here. (via the prepared)

Here are some notes about how the store works:
great print quality!
I worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,
so they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m
delighted with how they turned out.
When I originally started working on this project I thought about using a
print-on-demand company briefly (it sounds so convenient!) but I ordered test
prints from all the ones I could find and it turns out that none of them could

But if you get an overhead view, as in this video from Taylor Glenn, you can see that often there’s very little movement in two of the three dimensions. The mastery of these small movements combined with the sweeping up-and-down motions creates a compelling illusion for ground-based viewers. The power of a different perspective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a talk at the Ignite conference, Marcin Wichary created a looping video about looping videos — you know, when the action in a video loops back over previous scenes, adding new layers of interaction as time goes on. (Think Marty McFly revisiting scenes from Back to the Future in Back to the Future 2.) Most impressively: he did it all live — and here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to recent government reports, declassified data, media interest in those data & reports, and a long-simmering interest by the public, UFOs are back in the public imagination. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who is searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, says that there’s little chance that UFOs are aliens.
I understand that U.F.O. sightings, which date back at least to 1947, are synonymous in the popular imagination with evidence of extraterrestrials. But scientifically speaking, there is little to warrant that connection. There are excellent reasons to search for extraterrestrial life, but there are equally excellent reasons not to conclude that we have found evidence of it with U.F.O. sightings.


If UFOs are alien craft, we would never see them:
There are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently visited by aliens, why don’t they just land on the White House lawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative, perhaps best exemplified by the TV show “The X-Files,” that these creatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us. But if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem surprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures technologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances between the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams at night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.


More people talking about a thing doesn’t make it credible. More people talking about potential evidence of a thing doesn’t make it credible. Evidence makes something credible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
it’s been a long while and I’ll start with a big sorry to all my loyal readers over the past years. I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[macOS Big Sur 11.4, which was released this morning, addresses a zero-day vulnerability that could allow attackers to piggyback off of apps like Zoom, taking secret screenshots and surrepetiously recording the screen.





Jamf, a mobile device management company, today highlighted a security issue that allowed Privacy preferences to be bypassed, providing an attacker with Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, and other permissions without a user's consent.



The bypass was actively exploited in the wild, and was discovered by Jamf when analyzing XCSSET malware. The XCSSET malware has been out in the wild since 2020, but Jamf noticed an uptick in recent activity and discovered a new variant.



Once installed on a victim's system, the malware was used specifically for taking screenshots of the user's desktop with no additional permissions required. Jamf said that it could be used to bypass other permissions as well, as long as the donor application the malware piggybacked off of had that permission enabled.



Jamf has a full rundown on how the exploit worked, and the company says that Apple addressed the vulnerability in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.4, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that a fix has indeed been enabled in macOS 11.4, so Mac users should update their software as soon as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The three week Epic Games v. Apple trial wrapped up today, with a series of debates that were held in lieu of traditional closing arguments. The wrap up follows Apple CEO Tim Cook's testimony last week, which saw him grilled by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Apple's App Store policies.





As outlined by Protocol, at the conclusion of the trial, Rogers aimed to get at the heart of the dispute and determine what remedies might ultimately be appropriate.



As she did earlier in the trial, Rogers hinted that she may be leaning toward something of a compromise with a ruling that would see Apple required to allow apps like Fortnite to direct users to make purchases on the web rather than in apps, something that's currently forbidden by the ‌App Store‌ rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New MacBook Pro models are coming at WWDC, according to leaker Jon Prosser who has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple's plans.





Prosser provided no additional information, but there are new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the works. The new MacBook Pros will feature the most radical redesign to the MacBook Pro lineup since 2016.



Apple is planning to reintroduce the MagSafe port, and the 2021 MacBook Pro models will feature an HDMI port and an SD card reader in addition to a trio of Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, and multiple color options are a possibility. 



There will be no Touch Bar included, with Apple returning to a traditional row of function keys, and there will be a redesigned thermal system to accommodate the upgraded Apple silicon chips that the machines are expected to include.



Bloomberg recently said that the new MacBook Pro models will feature 10-core Apple silicon chips with eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, along with 16 or 32-core GPU options and support for up to 64GB RAM.



No other sources have indicated that the MacBook Pro models will be coming at WWDC, and it has been atypical for Apple to debut hardware at the event in recent years, but it is not unheard of. The new MacBook Pro models are expected to enter production in the second half of 2021, and reliable sources that include Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have suggested a launch in the second half of the year.

iFixit is tearing down the mid-tier purple ‌iMac‌ model with an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and 8GB RAM. It's worth noting that the internals of this model will look different than the internals of the base model with a 7-core GPU as the two machines have different cooling systems.



The base ‌iMac‌ has a single cooling fan and a heat sink while the higher-end 8-core GPU models have two fans and a heat pipe along with heat sinks, so expect the internals to look different if you have a 7-core GPU ‌iMac‌.

How to start your journey, and where it is all headed
 Biomutant is a role-playing game where your experience tends to be differentiated more by character alignment rather than by their build of attributes and gear. The first two hours of Biomutant onboard the player to the world’s lore; its combat, crafting, and other systems; and then send them off on their first main mission. 
This Biomutant beginner’s guide will help you understand the game’s story, the ethos that informs the choices you have to make, and the initial choices themselves, so that you can shape your character and your story in a sensible way.

Apple entirely overhauled the ‌Siri‌ Remote's design. It has an all-aluminum body that does away with the touchpad interface, instead adopting a touch-based clickpad and several additional buttons for control purposes.

 Victoria 3, a sequel so long-awaited by its fans the title has become a meme, is in development and coming soon. The grand strategy title was a keynote reveal of this weekend’s PDXCon, the annual gathering for all things Paradox Interactive.
Paradox’s Victoria series is a “society simulation” set in Great Britain during the time surrounding the industrial revolution. The most recent title was 2010’s Victoria 2 for PC. In the decade since, Victoria fans had beaten news or rumor of a sequel into a meme somewhat like the well-known Half-Life 3 meme. 
This weekend, the meme died. A Paradox Interactive community manager took to the official forums this weekend to start a meme contest for the game, posting this picture of game director Martin Anward (which Anward himself tweeted out on Friday.)

“Victoria 3 is instantly one of the most highly anticipated grand strategy games in Paradox’s history,” the company said in a statement, obliquely acknowledging its meme status. In the game, players take one of “dozens of nations,” not just the U.K., and lead it through a time of societal change, technological innovation, economic turmoil, and geopolitical rivalries.
Paradox’s news release did not say when Victoria 3 would launch, but did say it would be available for Windows PC via Steam, Xbox Game Pass for PC, and the Paradox Store.
As for the meme contest, I don’t know who won, but this was my personal favorite:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salvador Rodriguez, reporting for CNBC:
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on Friday said the social media company is
happy to pay Apple’s 30% commission rate on in-app transactions.
“We really feel like Snapchat wouldn’t exist without the iPhone
and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,” Spiegel
said on TechCheck. “In that sense, I’m not sure we have a choice
about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we’re happy to do it in
exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us
in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware
advancements.”
At first blush you might think this is lickspittle-ism. But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap.
But here’s thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. From Investopedia, citing Snap’s 10-K for 2020:
Substantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,
which accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in
revenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.
99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.
Find me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its announcement last month, Apple today officially flipped the switch to allow parents to share their Apple Card with their teenagers or friends and the ability for spouses to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌ account. However, one notable feature that didn't get released today is the ability for two separate ‌Apple Card‌ accounts to be merged into one.





Apple announced the feature last month but didn't specifically pin a release date. Now, in a new support document, Apple says that starting later on in July, users will be able to merge two existing ‌Apple Card‌ accounts into one, and in doing so, be able to combine their credit limits. 

Coming July 2021: You will be able to invite another ‌Apple Card‌ owner to combine credit limits and form one co-owned account.1
The ability to share an ‌Apple Card‌ with iCloud Family members above 13 years old and the ability to co-own an ‌Apple Card‌ were released today as part of the iOS 14.6 update.

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is well over one hundred thousand light years across. We only see a pitiful portion of it. Although it contains several hundred billion stars in its expanse, we can only see a fraction of a fraction of them.
And even that doesn’t fully capture the essence of a galaxy, which also has planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and more. Galaxies are colossal objects, their true nature only becoming apparent to us a century ago.


I know I’ve posted photos like this before, but every time I see something like this, my mind boggles anew at the sheer scale and magnitude of it all and I just have to share it.
P.S. And Earth contains the only sentient life in the entire universe? Lol.

Announced last month, ‌Apple Card‌ Family allows families to share a single ‌Apple Card‌ with users above 13 years old with the ability to set a spending limit.





Following its release, Apple has shared two how-to videos on how exactly to share an Apple Card with your teenager or friend and how to co-own a single Apple Card with your significant other. The process for sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with a friend or teenager is enabled within the Wallet app on iOS 14.6 or later and requires that you be in an iCloud Family with the person you wish to share the card with.  








Last month, Apple also announced the ability for couples to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌, allowing them to build their credit score together. The process is similar to sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with your teenager or friend but requires you to share your spouse's annual income. 








‌Apple Card‌ Family is available today with the iOS 14.6 update.

Final Fantasy Origin rumored for PS5, PC
 Nioh and Ninja Gaiden developer Team Ninja is developing a new Final Fantasy spinoff action game for Square Enix, according to a report from Fanbyte. That game, reportedly titled Final Fantasy Origin, is expected to be announced in June in conjunction with E3 2021. Square Enix is confirmed to appear at this year’s E3.
Fanbyte’s report follows a series of rumors regarding Final Fantasy Origin, which has been compared to FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The Final Fantasy spinoff is said to be “more accessible [than Nioh] for a wider audience” and set during the events of the first game in the franchise. Origin is reportedly bound for PlayStation 5, with a Windows PC version coming later.
Another component of the rumor surrounding Final Fantasy Origin is that Team Ninja will release a playable demo of the game this summer to solicit feedback from players. The studio similarly released “alpha” demos of Nioh and Nioh 2 ahead of each game’s final product.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. That game features two characters based on the original Final Fantasy, the Warrior of Light (pictured above) and Garland.
Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 14.6, the sixth update to the tvOS 14 operating system that was released in September 2020. tvOS 14.6 comes a month after the release of tvOS 14.5, an update that added a new Color Balance feature and support for the latest gaming controllers.





tvOS 14.6, which is a free update, can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the Apple TV by going to System > Software Update. ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates enabled will be upgraded to tvOS 14.5 automatically.



tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing primarily on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than outward-facing changes. tvOS 14.6 lays the groundwork for the new Apple Music Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio features.



Spatial Audio offers an immersive audio experience that makes it sound like music is coming from all around you, while Lossless Audio will provide higher-quality songs that sound exactly like they do when artists record them in the studio.



At launch in June, thousands of tracks will feature Spatial Audio support, and more than 20,000 songs will support Lossless Audio. By the end of the year, 75 million songs will support it.

There’s other stuff too, but the bear’s fun
 Crusader Kings 3’s first major expansion is coming soon, and it’s all about your seat of power. Royal Court allows medieval rulers to hang out in a 3D throne room, meet with their courtiers, and hire bards to sing epic tales. 
Royal Court fleshes out one of Crusader Kings 3’s most intriguing elements — managing your home base. Players have to deal with unruly vassals and rebellions, hold feasts, seduce lords, and ferret out secrets. Sometimes, the stories that take place in the player’s own royal hall are far more compelling than anything that happens over foreign borders.
Therefore, it makes sense that Royal Court turns your throne room into a much more tangible place that players can decorate, show off, and fill with fun entertainment like woodworkers or, uh, angry bears.
The Royal Court expansion will also introduce hybrid cultures and new ways for cultures to develop and diverge over the years, allowing rulers to make new ways of life for their kingdoms and empires. A previous, smaller scale expansion in March added winter weather and Norse invasions.
Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court will launch later in 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past November, the Apple TV app made its debut on Xbox gaming consoles, now, the Apple TV app is gaining support for Dolby Vision on Xbox, offering viewers improved high dynamic range paired with Dolby Atmos for a truly cinematic experience.





Xbox says that to enable Dolby Vision for ‌Apple TV‌ on Xbox, users must first have a compatible TV that supports high dynamic range. With compatible TVs, users will find a new toggle under "TV & display options" in their Xbox settings tab to enable Dolby Vision. Additionally, not all ‌Apple TV‌ content will initially support Dolby Vision. 

To start experiencing it with a Dolby Vision compatible TV, you need to have “Allow Dolby Vision” enabled and checked in Settings > General > TV & display options > Video Modes on your console. You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.
The ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices such as the PS4, and select smart TVs. This is part of Apple's recent strategy to expand its services business to more customers.

Raid charts are a universal language in Destiny, and key to taking on its hardest challenges
 Vault of Glass, the original Destiny raid, made its debut in Destiny 2 on Saturday. Bungie gave the old raid a new coat of paint, and many teams — including my own — dove in to conquer the challenge within the first 24 hours. But even though we all knew the fights from the original game, it didn’t stop me and a host of my peers from participating in my favorite Destiny raid-race experience: chart-making.
Destiny raids are like a cooperative puzzle. Players normally need to communicate information about something that only they can see to someone else who has to apply that information. Shouting “the thing to your left” doesn’t usually cut it, especially in a day-one scenario,…]]></summary>

Meet Thunderbird
 Ubisoft is constantly updating Rainbow Six Siege, and a new Operator is coming to the game along with a slew of quality-of-life changes to the meta. Operation North Star is the next big update, and and the star is Mina “Thunderbird” Sky, an Indigenous Nakoda pilot with powerful healing tech.
Thunderbird carries a trio of deployable healing turrets known as the Kona Station.  She’s a flexible, fast Operator who can get around a defense site quickly to drop her Kona Stations. Players who enter a Kona Station’s radius are healed; the Station then goes on cooldown. Her weapon options include a Spear .308 and SPAS-15, as well as a backup Bearing-9 and Q-929.
Ubisoft is also reworking the Favela map, which is similar aesthetically but dramatically changed layout wise. The Operator Melusi is also getting a rework to make her less of a balance headache for players (her Banshee gadget can now be destroyed by a single bullet.) Operation North Star has tons of changes to make the game clearer and more fun, which are explained in detail on Ubisoft’s official site.
Operation North Star is live on Ubisoft’s test servers on May 25; it is slated to launch to all players in mid-June.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anker today is introducing a new set of gallium nitride (GaN) USB-C chargers that offer fast charging speeds for mobile devices in a design that's smaller than ever. The new Nano II line is available in 30W, 45W, and 65W versions, and Anker says it has improved the chips and internal layout of its chargers to deliver greater efficiency while generating less heat.





The 30-watt charger measures in at just 31.5 mm by 30.4 mm and about 38 mm deep. (The UK versions of all three chargers are about 1.5 mm deeper due to their prong design.) It can fast-charge an iPhone or iPad, and even fully support the latest MacBook Air.



The 45-watt version offers a bit more power to be able to charge a wider variety of notebooks and other gadgets, and it measures 37.7 mm by 35 mm by about 41 mm. It also features foldable prongs to make it less likely to be damaged or to damage other items when tossed in together.



The 65-watt version can fully power devices all the way up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it too features foldable prongs. The charger measures 41.7 mm by 36 mm by about 44 mm.



All three chargers are available for preorder on Amazon and Anker.com for US customers, priced at $29.99, $35.99, and $39.99 respectively. Versions for UK and EU customers will be available at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has filed the unreleased "Beats Studio Buds" in the FCC or Federal Communications Commission database under model numbers A2512 and A2513. The new filings come after the reveal of the new earbuds last week within the release candidates for iOS and tvOS 14.6.





The new earbuds feature a smaller design with no stem, much in line with what we're expecting to be a similar design language for the second-generation AirPods Pro. In addition, according to code found within the latest iOS release candidate, the new Beats Studio Buds will feature Active Noise Cancellation, currently a feature exclusive to Apple's ‌AirPods Pro‌ and AirPods Max. 





Today's new FCC filings reveal nothing new about the design or the feature set of the upcoming earbuds; however, its filing indicates that a release should be imminent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation redesigned Siri Remote features a touch-sensitive clickpad that can be used to navigate menus as well as fast-forward and rewind video. 





When you first start using the ‌Siri‌ Remote, touch surface tracking is on by default, but if you can't get on with the sensitivity or you're just not comfortable using touch controls on a remote, you can always customize it or turn it off. 





Change Siri Remote Clickpad Functionality



Launch the Settings app on your Apple TV.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select ClickPad.


Select Click and Touch to allow both clicking and touch surface tracking, or Click Only to turn off touch surface tracking.






Change Siri Remote Tracking Sensitivity



Launch the Settings app on your ‌Apple TV‌.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select Touch Surface Tracking.


Select Fast to make smaller thumb movements move farther on the ‌Apple TV‌ screen, or Slow to reduce tracking sensitivity.






If you're having trouble scrubbing through video when playback is paused, check our mini guide to make sure you're using the correct clickpad gesture.

from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Peter Fintl, the director of technology and innovation for Capgemini Engineering Germany, explained that Apple's movement in vehicle supply chains is noticeable.
We have seen enough echoes in the supply chain that we know Apple is really looking into every detail of car engineering and car manufacturing. But nobody knows if what Apple creates will be a car or a tech platform or a mobility service.
The report suggests that Apple's car project may not actually culminate in a consumer-purchasable complete vehicle. Instead, Apple may …]]></summary>

Canada still haven’t won a game. 
 On the eve of day four of the IIHF World Championships, taking place in Riga, Latvia, the standings don’t look as many had predicted.
At the top of each group stands Russia in A and Germany in B, par for the course, especially considering the hockey talent Germany has produced in recent years. In particular, Lukas Reichel, a player we were personally high on, has stood out with five points in his first two games. 
However, Canada have not won a game yet (their goal differential sits at -6!) and the USA find themselves in 5th place at 1-1 with a +3 goal difference.

It includes several thousand of some of the most popular websites, represented as distinct “countries”, which are grouped together with others of similar type or category, forming dozens of distinct clusters, regions and continents that stretch throughout the map, such as “news sites”, “search engines”, “social networks”, “e-commerce”, “adult entertainment”, “file sharing”, “software companies” and so much more.  In the center of it all can be found ISPs and web browsers, which form the core and backbone of the internet as we know it, while the far south is the domain of the mysterious “dark web”.

*The first round is going to be over fast; have you selected a bandwagon? A team from the Central Division, perhaps? [BSH]
*As more and more of these guys end up in the NHL, the one-stacked prospect corps will naturally thin out. Right now, who are the best of the bunch? [Inquirer]
*About those top prospects transitioning... Joel Farabee did that pretty nicely eh? We’re going to need him to get even better. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of getting better, we grade out this season’s bottom six forwards. [BSH]
*Kevin Hayes was playing injured this season. Which, frankly, seems obvious. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This weekend’s playoff action continued the excitement we’ve seen from this first round so far. Unfortunately, this weekend also brought us an incredibly scary moment for Leafs’ captain John Tavares. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*This weekend also brought a long suspension for Nazem Kadri. Which we are forced to compare to Tom Wilson. And then think about things. [Mile High Hockey]
*He’s appealing, though. [AP]
*And finally, another decision by the DoPS brings another round of calls for some kind of examination of the NHL’s discipline process. It just plain isn’t working. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the new Apple TV 4K now in customers' hands, some users are reporting issues when trying to control video with the redesigned Siri Remote. 





Specifically, some users are complaining that using the circular gesture on the new clickpad ring to fast-forward or rewind paused video isn't working as expected. Rather than scrubbing through video continually in the direction of the gesture, the video scrubs back and forth in opposite directions.



From what we've been able to work out, the problem seems to relate to a subtle additional gesture that users are missing out, either because it isn't very intuitive or Apple doesn't demonstrate it particularly well in the marketing material.

With no dog in the fight, it’s always fun to pick one.
 In the sleepiest days of the Flyers’ offseason, there’s not much to do in terms of leisure activities aside from watching baseball or playoff hockey. The latter might be a bit painful given the status of your favorite team, but fear not; we here at Broad Street Hockey are creating a brief, yet vaguely comprehensive guide to each division and the teams who you might choose to root for in their quest for the Cup. In the interest of hatred of rivals (a primary interest of any Flyers fan) the East division won’t be receiving this treatment, particularly because Philly fans are familiar with the teams included in that category.
Today’s overview will cover the Central division, aka my home turf. A…]]></summary>
