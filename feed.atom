Along the way, they visit the Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, the market on Rue Mouffetard, the Jardins du Luxembourg, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and lots more. If you turn the closed captions on, you can read about the histories of the places as the walk progresses. Hopefully this will tide me over until I can visit again. (via open culture)

As disguised cell phone towers proliferate, I find it ironic that instead of providing camouflage, their disguises actually unmask their true identities. The towers have an array of creative concealments. They often impersonate trees such as evergreens, palms, and saguaros.

It takes significant resources behind the scenes to ensure these

location to payment details. While it’s impossible to catch every

explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As noted by Stephen Hackett, only the green, blue, pink, and silver iMacs will be stocked in Apple retail stores. Yellow, orange, and purple are online-order only. But I wonder if they’ll have display models of the yellow/orange/purples ones, so folks can see them in person before ordering?

But, it gets worse. Seeing as this is Florida, which (obviously) is a place where Disney has some clout — and Disney has famously powerful lobbyists all over the damn place — it appears that Disney made sure the Florida legislature gave them a carveout. Florida Senator Ray Rodriques introduced an amendment to the bill, which got included in the final vote. The original bill said that this would apply to any website with 100 million monthly individual users globally. The R…]]></summary>

Roku is alleging that Google is using the YouTube TV negotiations

Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza
cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to
minuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the
public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from
spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in
much the same way as SARS-CoV-2, but they are less effective at
jumping from host to host.
