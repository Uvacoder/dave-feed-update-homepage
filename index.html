                    <span>Obviously, there are trees. But speaking phylogenetically, trees aren’t a thing. Some things that are trees evolved from things that are not trees and other things that are trees evolved into things that aren’t trees. Confused? This might clear things up.
“Trees” are not a coherent phylogenetic category. On the evolutionary tree of plants, trees are regularly interspersed with things that are absolutely, 100% not trees. This means that, for instance, either:
The common ancestor of a maple and a mulberry tree was not a tree.


See also there’s no such thing as a vegetable and there’s no such thing as a fish.
What would the evolutionary tree of salmon, lungfish, and cows be? The answer, it appears at first glance, is simple. Salmon and lungfish, being fish, would cluster nicely together on one branch, and very non-fishy cows would be off on a separate branch. Right? Wrong. Contrary to what you might expect, what you see above is their evolutionary tree. Working up from the root, the lineage that leads to salmon branches off first. Keep tracing up the tree, and you’ll see that the lineage from which the salmon branched off eventually branches into two new lineages: the one leading to lungfish and the other leading to cows. In other words, a cow and a lungfish are more closely related to one another than either is to salmon.

                    <span>Patrick Stewart, displaying the Shakespearian acting chops that landed him the role of Captain Picard on Star Trek: The Next Generation, appeared on Sesame Street in 1996, performing a parody of Hamlet’s soliloquy with the letter “B”. Stewart never doesn’t give it his all when acting.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>A key new feature of macOS Monterey is the ability to AirPlay content to a supported Mac from other Apple devices, such as an iPhone or iPad, and we&#x27;ve confirmed with Apple that this will include Apple Fitness+ workout videos with one limitation.





After starting an Apple Fitness+ workout on an iPhone or iPad, users will be able to wirelessly stream the audio and video to a supported Mac using AirPlay, providing a convenient way to view the workouts on a larger screen. The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.



AirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:
MacBook Pro (2018 and later)


MacBook Air (2018 and later)


iMac (2019 and later)


iMac Pro (2017)


Mac mini (2020 and later)


Mac Pro (2019)
We&#x27;ve encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.



Apple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.



Launched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.

                    <span>Apple would not be permitted to sell iPhones with its own apps installed under proposed U.S. antitrust legislation that was released last week. Representative David Cicilline confirmed the self-preferencing ban in a discussion with reporters, details of which were shared by Bloomberg.





Rather than pre-installed apps, Apple would have to offer other app options for consumers to download. Right now, iPhones come with a range of free Apple-designed apps from Messages and FaceTime to Calendar and Notes.



&quot;It would be equally easy to download the other five apps as the Apple one so they&#x27;re not using their market dominance to favor their own products and services,&quot; said Cicilline.



Preventing Apple from selling iPhones with its own apps installed would drastically change the iPhone&#x27;s setup process, making it considerably less streamlined, more complicated, and potentially more expensive if customers were prompted to purchase or subscribe to third-party apps and services to replicate the functionality that Apple provides at no cost.



According to Cicilline, this would also apply to Amazon Prime because Amazon&#x27;s ability to sell its own products over third-party products disadvantages some sellers.



U.S. House lawmakers last week debuted sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation in the form of five different bills aimed at major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The bills would apply to businesses that have a market capitalization of $600 billion and at least 50 million monthly active users in the United States.



If passed, these bills would overhaul competition laws that have not been revisited for decades and would lead to significant changes in the tech industry. The House Judiciary Committee will review the five bills at a hearing next week.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning participated in a virtual interview at the VivaTech conference, which is described as Europe&#x27;s biggest startup and tech event. Cook was interviewed by Guillaume Lacroix, CEO and founder of Brut, a media company that creates short-form video content.






Much of the discussion centered on privacy, as it often does in interviews that Cook participates in. He reiterated once again how important privacy is to Apple.
We&#x27;ve been focused on privacy for over a decade. We see it as a basic human right. A fundamental human right. And we&#x27;ve been focused on privacy for decades.

                    <span>With no sign of redesigned MacBook Pro models at this year&#x27;s WWDC, when can customers expect the much-anticipated new models to launch?





A number of reports, including investor notes from Morgan Stanley and Wedbush analysts, claimed that new MacBook Pro models would be coming during this year&#x27;s WWDC. This did not happen, much to the disappointment of MacBook Pro fans, who have been anticipating redesigned machines with Apple silicon chips.



The &quot;M2&quot; chip purportedly destined for the next-generation MacBook Pro models has already entered mass production, according to supply chain sources, but there have been several reports that Apple has experienced unexpected delays with the production of the new models.

In addition, Apple also uses sensor fusion, which combines data from sensors onboard the Apple Watch and ‌iPhone‌ to provide users with a more comprehensive view of their health.

                    <span>A partial Apple Card outage impacting the ability of some customers to make in-store purchases using their ‌Apple Card‌ with Apple Pay is facing its second day in a row of issues, according to Apple&#x27;s system status page.





On Monday, Apple said that some customers would be unable to make in-store purchases with their ‌Apple Card‌, and two days later, the issue continues to persist. These new issues follow a widespread Apple Card outage earlier this month that lasted several hours, impacting all ‌Apple Card‌ customers. The current issue facing some ‌Apple Card‌ customers is limited to in-store purchases, but online purchases seem to be working as normal. 



‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a tightly integrated financial service into Apple&#x27;s products and services. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs to be the issuing bank for the card, meaning it&#x27;s currently limited to just the United States. ‌Apple Card‌ features are integrated into the Wallet app with color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and up to three percent cashback on purchases, paid out daily.



Update: Apple&#x27;s system status page now says that the issue is resolved and ‌Apple Card‌ is working as normal.

                    <span>In 2016, Apple considered an &quot;audacious&quot; plan to launch its own healthcare service, based on a subscription, with &quot;Apple doctors&quot; at clinics for customers, according to The Wall Street Journal.





The project, which has since stalled due to internal concerns, was to offer customers an all-encompassing healthcare service that would integrate data collected from the iPhone and Apple Watch. On the project&#x27;s heels, an internal team studied how data collected from the Apple Watch could improve healthcare service.

One of its most ambitious healthcare ideas was a plan to offer primary-care medicine, conceived in 2016, according to documents and the people familiar with the plan. An Apple team spent months trying to figure out how the flood of health and wellness data collected from use…</span>

                    <span>Twitter is considering offering users the ability to &quot;unmention&quot; themselves in other people&#x27;s tweets as part of a wider privacy drive for the social media platform.





The early concept has been shared by Twitter designed Dominic Camozzi, who says the idea behind it is to help users control unwanted attention.



An example image shows a notification when the user has been mentioned in a tweet, with an option to &quot;Unmention yourself&quot; (i.e. remove your Twitter handle from it) without the author of the tweet being notified of the change.



In another related option currently being weighed up, Twitter could send you a notification when someone you don&#x27;t follow mentions you, allowing you to review the tweet, unmention yourself from it, and block that user from mentioning you again.




Notifications
Going further, if someone you don’t follow @ mentions you, you’ll get a special notification. If you unmention yourself from there, the Tweet author will not be able to mention you again. pic.twitter.com/RTFBEnkPFf
— Dominic Camozzi (@_dcrc_) June 14, 2021
 


Additionally, Camozzi is toying with the idea of giving users the ability to &quot;control mass mentions&quot; by preventing anyone on the platform from mentioning them for one day, three days, or seven days, thereby providing respite for anyone inundated with activity related to their account.



As with all early concepts, these changes may or may not be implemented by Twitter, and the company is actively looking for feedback from users regarding the ideas.

                    <span>With the popularity of Disney+ showing no signs of abating, Disney is satisfied with its paid subscriber model and has no plans to introduce a cheaper ad-supported tier anytime soon.





That was the take-home message from Disney CEO Bob Chapek when asked about the possibility of a cheaper plan offering for its video streaming service, according to The Verge. Speaking at the Credit Suisse 23rd Annual Communications Conference on Tuesday, Chapek said:

&quot;We&#x27;re always re-evaluating how we go to market across the world, but we&#x27;ve got no such plans now to do that. We&#x27;re happy with the models that we&#x27;ve got right now. We won&#x27;t limit ourselves and say no to anything. But right now, we have no such plans for that.&quot;

Still talking defense!
 We simply cannot stop talking about defensemen around here, apparently. Next up on the board we have Simon Edvinsson, a Swedish left shot defenseman, and also one of the more polarizing players in this top prospect group. Edvinsson is a bit of a project, and scouts are divided on just how high his ceiling is, and what his chances are of reaching it, but the fact also remains that he possesses one of the more dynamic toolkits of this same top prospect group, and all of that makes him an intriguing name to watch.

A multiplayer game for friendship
 There are some multiplayer games that come with a warning: Play with your friends and family at your own risk. That includes games like Overcooked and any Mario Party title — Overcooked for the stress of working together in chaotic scenarios, and Mario Party for the inevitable strain of betrayal. This doesn’t mean these games aren’t great or fun: They’re fantastic! They can both bring you together or tear you apart. But in the end, the games are infamous — for different reasons — for the fights they create.
However, I’ve found the antidote: Chicory: A Colorful Tale. Released in June, Chicory is a 2D adventure game named after a famous painter who stops paint…</span>

But can its systems support more complex play?
 Free Lives is best known for its 2014 side-scrolling action game, Broforce. The game features pixelated caricatures of action movie heroes blowing stuff up with big guns and even bigger American flags. So imagine my surprise in early June when the team announced its next project, Terra Nil, a “reverse city-builder” about restoring wild areas after an ecological disaster.
After spending a few hours with an early demo of Terra Nil, it’s hard to imagine a bigger departure for the studio, but I’m all in. After nearly two years of homebound hyper-vigilance brought on by political chaos and a global pandemic, this is the deeply chill distraction that I needed.

                    <span>In Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 film Rashomon, the story of the murder of a samurai is told from several different viewpoints and each account of the event is different and even contradictory. In real life as in cinema, the Rashomon Effect describes how events can be recalled in contradictory ways by well-meaning but ultimately subjective witnesses. In this short TED-Ed video, the Rashomon Effect and its implications are explained and explored. (via open culture)

                    <span>Over at A Cup of Jo, Joanna Goddard interviewed three kids who are transgender about their experiences. Here’s Violet, she/her, age 13:
What do you wish people knew about being trans?


Aya, she/her, age 9:
How did you tell your parents?
that’s me. I was five.


And this:
Also, fun fact: When we were watching a Mo Willems episode about drawing, he told us that his child is transgender — the one from Knuffle Bunny. Trixie is now Trix!


The comments on the post are worth reading as well — CoJ has the best comments section on the internet, quite a feat for 2021.

                    <span>Perhaps the most consequential day in the Earth’s recent history was when a massive asteroid struck the planet 66 million years ago. It resulted in earthquakes, tsunamis, fireballs raining from the sky, volcanoes, atmospheric heat shocks, wildfires, global winter, and the extinction of 75% of all species on Earth, including the dinosaurs. This video by Kurzgesagt leads us through what happened that day, minute by minute.
This video reminded me of Peter Brannen’s eye-popping description of this event from his book The Ends of the World:
“The meteorite itself was so massive that it didn’t notice any atmosphere whatsoever,” said Rebolledo. “It was traveling 20 to 40 kilometers per second, 10 kilometers — probably 14 kilometers — wide, pushing the atmosphere and building such incredible pressu…</span>

                    <span>Using publicly available datasets of English words, their etymologies, and their semantic distances, software engineer Daniel de Haas generated pairs &amp; triples of words that have a common origin but otherwise are unrelated to each other. 
“actor” &amp; “coagulate”
Both of these words derive ultimately from the Latin “ago”, meaning “act”, “do”, “make”, and a bunch of other things.
English “actor” is a short hop away from “ago”, but “coagulate” takes a longer path: “ago” ➔ “cogo” (“collect”) ➔ “coagulum” (“a clot”) ➔ “coagulo” (“to clot”).



“educate” &amp; “subdue”
“Educate” comes from the Latin “eductus”, meaning to “lead or bring out”, and then the Latin “educare” (“raise, train, mould”). I love the image of education as the process of extruding a refined person out of a base of unrefined material.
“Subdue” comes from the latin “subduco”, meaning “lead under”. Again, a very clear physical description of what the word means — to put beneath you, or bring under control.

                    <span>In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, one of several new accessibility features that Apple has introduced is Background Sounds, which is designed to minimize distractions and help you stay focused, stay calm, and minimize distractions with the help of your iPhone or iPad.





The Background Sounds on offer include balanced, bright, and dark noise, as well as natural sounds like ocean, rain, and stream. All of the sounds can be set to play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.



The following steps explain how to enable Background Sounds on iOS devices running ‌iOS 15‌.
Launch the Settings app on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.


Tap Accessibility.


Under &quot;Hearing,&quot; tap Audio/Visual.



Tap Background Sounds.


Tap the switch to turn on Background Sounds.


Tap Sound to choose a sound effect.


Choose from Balanced Noise, Bright Noise, Dark Noise, Ocean, Rain, and Stream.


Your device will need to download individual sound effects when you play them for the first time, so make sure you have an internet connection, but after that you can play the background sound whether or not you&#x27;re online.

Headed up by Amy Klobuchar, the Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights is today hosting a hearing on &quot;Protecting Competition and Innovation in Home Technologies.&quot; Most of Sonos&#x27; complaints relayed by Lazarus are focused on Amazon and Google, but he did have a few comments about Apple.

                    <span>The Mayo Clinic today debuted support for the Apple Health records feature available on the iPhone, allowing Mayo Clinic patients to add their medical records to the Health app.





Health Records is a feature that&#x27;s designed to allow patients to view and aggregate all of their health data in one easy-to-access spot on the ‌iPhone‌. More than 700 institutions and 12,000 care locations now offer support for Health Records in the United States, Canada, and the UK.



Mayo Clinic patients who have a Patient Services Account can access that data through the Health app using their Patient Services username and password. The feature is opt-in and available as an option for Mayo Clinic patients with an ‌iPhone‌.
&quot;There are more ways than ever for patients to be actively engaged in their health care, and smartphone apps can be helpful for accessing records and tracking daily fitness and diet,&quot; says Steve Ommen, M.D., medical director of Experience Products for Mayo Clinic&#x27;s Center for Digital Health. &quot;We want patients who are interested in these apps to be able to use them securely and enhance their health care at Mayo Clinic.&quot;
Health Records are downloaded onto the ‌iPhone‌ using an encrypted connection, with the data stored on the user&#x27;s device and encrypted with a passcode to ensure everything is kept private. Health Records data is not available to Apple.

                    <span>With macOS Monterey, Apple has introduced expanded AirPlay 2 support, so you can ‌AirPlay‌ content from an iPhone, iPad, or even another Mac to your main Mac. We thought we&#x27;d do a quick demo of this handy new feature in our latest YouTube video.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


With ‌AirPlay‌ to Mac, you can extend or mirror an Apple device&#x27;s display to a Mac, and since two Macs are supported, a Mac can use another Mac as an external display, which is a kind of substitute for the Target Display Mode that used to exist for Macs.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works wirelessly or using an appropriate cable, and the wired connection is useful for cutting down on latency.



You can also turn your Mac into a speaker that can be used for multiroom audio alongside other ‌AirPlay‌ 2 devices.



‌AirPlay‌ to Mac works with the 2018 or later MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, 2019 or later iMac or Mac Pro, the ‌iMac‌ Pro, and the 2020 or later Mac mini.



Apple has also added a useful new Universal Control feature that lets you control multiple Macs and iPads with a single keyboard, trackpad, or mouse, but Universal Control does not appear to be functional in the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta.

                    <span>Apple Music Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and ‌Apple Music‌ Lossless quality started rolling out to ‌Apple Music‌ users last week, but customers in India have noticed that the two new features are not yet available.





On Twitter, ‌Apple Music‌ users in India have been questioning why Spatial Audio is not available and when it might be launching, especially because the feature has been coming and going for some users. Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio has not yet officially launched in India, but Apple has not forgotten about the country and has confirmed that spatial audio is debuting soon.



The Apple Music website in India has a &quot;coming soon&quot; tag for Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio. There is no specific launch date available as of yet, but because some users have been seeing the options appear and disappear, it&#x27;s likely ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers in India won&#x27;t have too much longer to wait.

                    <span>Apple today shared the trailer for the second season of animated comedy &quot;Central Park,&quot; which is set to launch on Apple TV+ on Friday, June 25.






&quot;Central Park&quot; follows a family who serve as caretakers for Central Park in New York City and who must fend off a wealthy hotel heiress who wants to turn the park into condos.



In the second season, the family continues to navigate living in and caring for the park.
In season two of &quot;Central Park,&quot; the Tillerman family continues to navigate living in and caring for the world&#x27;s most famous park. Molly experiences the trials and tribulations of adolescence, Cole is challenged by a truly embarrassing moment at school, Paige continues to chase down the mayor&#x27;s corruption story, and Owen juggles managing the park, his staff and his family all with a smile on his face. Meanwhile, Bitsy inches ever closer to her sinister goal of claiming Central Park as her own; with Helen by her side, eternally wondering whether she&#x27;s made it into Bitsy&#x27;s will. Every step of the way, we are guided along by our friendly, fumbling, fiddler narrator, Birdie.
&quot;Central Park&quot; characters are voiced by Josh Gad, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Kathryn Hahn, Tituss Burgess, and Stanley Tucci. It was created and written by Loren Bouchard, known for &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers.&quot;



The first season of &quot;Central Park&quot; was recognized with an Emmy Award nomination for Leslie Odom Jr., and was also nominated for the 2021 NAACP Image Awards in the Outstanding Animated Series category.

                    <span>Twelve South today launched the &quot;SurfacePad for iPhone 12,&quot; a new MagSafe-compatible wallet folio case for the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 mini. The $49.99 leather case comes in brown cognac, black, and plum colors.





The SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ was designed to protect the front and back of the ‌iPhone 12‌, and includes two interior pockets for ID and bank cards. Since the cards are on the front portion of the folio, you&#x27;ll also be able to wirelessly charge your ‌iPhone 12‌ with the SurfacePad on, unlike Apple&#x27;s first party wallet accessory.



To attach SurfacePad to an ‌iPhone 12‌, there&#x27;s a &quot;SurfaceGrip 2.0&quot; adhesive on the back of the accessory, which sticks to the back of your iPhone. Twelve South says this adhesive is reusable and super secure and it leaves no trace of sticky residue when removed.





You can purchase SurfacePad for ‌iPhone 12‌ on Twelve South&#x27;s website today for $49.99.

                    <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today announced an investigation into the &quot;duopoly&quot; of Apple and Google on mobile ecosystems, just one day after a similar investigation was initiated in Japan.







The CMA will be taking a closer look at Apple and Google&#x27;s &quot;effective duopoly&quot; on the supply of operating systems, including iOS and Android, the App Store and Google Play Store, and web browsers such as Safari and Chrome. The CMA defines &quot;mobile ecosystems&quot; as &quot;gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services,&quot; meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.



The CMA says that consumers could be &quot;losing out across a wide range of areas&quot; as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to &quot;reduced innovation&quot; and &quot;consumers paying higher prices.&quot; The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies&#x27; market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.



The CMA was already investigating Apple&#x27;s ‌App Store‌ policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.



The UK is also in the process of establishing a new &quot;pro-competition&quot; regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. 



Yesterday, the Japan Times reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google&#x27;s duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.

                    <span>Apple in iPadOS 15 has added the ability to access NTFS-formatted media from within the Files app. The additional support for the Windows-related format, first discovered by YouTuber Steven Fjordstrøm, is read-only, so like on macOS you can&#x27;t modify files stored on NTFS devices, but you can at least copy any data on them for working on elsewhere on your iPad.





The Files app has also gotten a new circular progress indicator to indicate the transfer of data when moving or copying files. Tapping the graphic opens a larger progress bar showing further details on the data transferred/remaining, the estimated time remaining, and the ability to cancel the transfer.



In another notable addition to the Files app, if you&#x27;re using a mouse or trackpad, it&#x27;s now possible to click-hold and drag a selection box over multiple files and folders to perform batch actions, such as compress, move, copy, and so on. Lastly, you can also now use Groups as a view option, so that files and folders are arranged on the screen in separate sections according to kind.



What do you think about the new additions to the Files app? Let us know in the comments. ‌iPadOS 15‌ is currently going through beta testing with developers, with a public beta due out next month and an official release in the fall.

                    <span>Apple last month announced that the HomePod mini would be made available in several new countries in June. Now, less than a month later, the ‌HomePod mini‌ has officially launched in Austria and Ireland, and is listed as &quot;available in June&quot; in New Zealand, suggesting availability in the next couple of weeks.





The ‌HomePod mini‌ is the follow-up to the original HomePod released in 2018. The full-sized ‌HomePod‌ failed to become a mainstream hit, leading to its discontinuation. The $99 ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌ but offers the same functionality enabled by Siri. 



The ‌HomePod mini‌ first launched in October of 2020 in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Spain, and the UK. Both the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ will gain support for Apple Music&#x27;s recently launched lossless audio feature via a software update later this year. Additionally, the ‌HomePod mini‌ will be able to be set as the default output speaker for Apple TV 4K starting later this year.

                    <span>Apple has published a new video to its official regional YouTube channels for European countries that focuses specifically on the new privacy features coming with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. 






The video, simply titled &quot;Privacy,&quot; opens with CEO Tim Cook speaking to the camera and explaining Apple&#x27;s long-standing stance on the topic:

At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. We work relentlessly to build it into everything we make, and it&#x27;s fundamental to how we design and engineer every product and service that we put out into the world. 



While others have focused on making customers the product, collecting ever-growing amounts of personal information, we&#x27;ve kept the lens focused on how technology can work for people. And that&#x27;s meant introducing countless fe…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-tv-plus-three-month-free-trial/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>For a while now, Apple has been running a promotion that offers a free one-year trial of Apple TV+ with any iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch purchase. That promotion ends on June 30, and Apple has today updated its website to show that from July 1 the included free trial shrinks to three months with eligible device purchases.





Apple has frequently offered promotions or credit for users to stay subscribed to the still relatively new service. Launched in 2019, ‌Apple TV+‌ continues to grow into a more mainstream streaming service; however, it still has some ways before catching up to Netflix and others. Apple offers original shows such as &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; &quot;The Morning Show,&quot; and &quot;See&quot; on the platform.



The new three-month trial will go into effect on July 1, so customers wanting to maximize their free ‌Apple TV+‌ subscription should purchase their product before the beginning of next month. Devices purchased before then will continue to be eligible for a one-year trial. 



The offer of a generous year-long free trial for ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ has been an important part of Apple&#x27;s strategy to lure in long-term subscribers by giving unfettered access to the full roster of content on the streaming service. ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ launched with a small amount of content compared with other rival services, so it has been crucial for Apple to build goodwill and interest about the service&#x27;s shows without expecting immediate returns. The company now appears to feel that the content offering has grown enough that a shorter trial will suffice going forward.



The new extension comes ahead of a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, where several hit shows, such as &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; and &quot;The Morning Show,&quot; will see their second seasons debut.

                    <span>Update: Apple has now announced that Apple Podcast Subscriptions for shows and channels is rolling out worldwide, showcasing a large number of new shows, groups of podcasts, and channels.



When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they automatically follow the show and the page is updated with a Subscriber Edition label so it is clear that they have access to the premium experience. As listeners subscribe to more channels, the Listen Now tab expands with new rows to provide easy access to all subscription content. Listeners who subscribe to two or more channels will also see a My Channels row in the Listen Now tab.








As expected, Apple Podcasts has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.





Apple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then decided to delay its launch to ensure that the &quot;best experience&quot; is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.



All subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple&#x27;s 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-music-android-beta-spatial-lossless-audio/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>When Apple last week launched Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio for Apple Music, it said that the new features would be &quot;coming soon&quot; to Android. Now, the company has released a new ‌Apple Music‌ beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.





As per the changelog for the release, spotted by 9to5Google:

In this update, ‌Apple Music‌ adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.



Other updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.
In the app&#x27;s Settings menu, there is a new &quot;Audio Quality&quot; sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.



The beta release for ‌Apple Music‌ 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.



Note that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.



Getting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‌Apple Music‌ user base on Android won&#x27;t have to wait much longer to get these features, too.



Apple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‌iPhone‌ 7 and later, all iPad Pro models, the 6th-generation ‌iPad‌ or later, the iPad Air 3 and later, the fifth-generation iPad mini and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/MacBook Air, and the 2020 or later iMac.

                    <span>In iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, you can enable anyone, even if they don&#x27;t have an Apple device, to join a FaceTime call with you by creating a link to a ‌FaceTime‌ conversation that can be shared anywhere.





Using this new link facility, friends and family members who do not have an Apple account can log into a ‌FaceTime‌ call with you using a web browser opened on any non-Apple device, whether that&#x27;s a Windows PC or an Android phone.



This effectively makes ‌FaceTime‌ a platform-agnostic video service, although you do need to be an iOS or Mac user to start the ‌FaceTime‌ call and send the link. Here&#x27;s how it works in ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌.




Launch the FaceTime app on your iPhone or iPad.


Tap Create Link.


Give your ‌FaceTime‌ Link an identifiable name by tapping Add Name at the top of the Actions menu that appears.


Select a method of sharing your link from the Actions menu, e.g. over Messages or Mail.




Once you&#x27;ve sent the link and the recipient opens it, they&#x27;ll be directed to a web page where they can enter their name to join the conversation. Once they&#x27;ve joined the call, they&#x27;ll have the usual ‌FaceTime‌ options to mute their microphone, disable video, switch the camera view, and leave the call.





For more information on all the new ‌FaceTime‌ features in ‌iOS 15‌, be sure to check out our upcoming dedicated guide.

For persevering through his recovery, he gets an award. 
 The Philadelphia Flyers have won something for their 2020-21 season... well, a player has.
Oskar Lindblom has won the Bill Masterton Trophy as the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey on Tuesday.
Congrats, @oskarlindblom!

Back in December 2019, Lindblom was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer (Ewing’s sarcoma). His season ended immediately and the hockey world surrounded the Flyers’ winger with support.
Just several months later, he was able to ring the bell at the Abramson Cancer Center at Pennsylvania Hospital, signifying that his cancer treatments were complete and he was on his way to full recovery. And less than two months after that, he was back on the ice in the middle of a playoff series against the New York Islanders in September. A remarkable comeback for a player that has played a pivotal role on the team the most recent season.
After coming back from his diagnosis and recovery, Lindblom played 50 games and earned 14 points in his supporting role.
Lindblom is the fourth member of the Flyers to win the Masterton — Ian Lapierre (2011), Tim Kerr (1989), and Bobby Clarke (1972) have earned the honor before him as members of this organization. This season, San Jose Sharks legend Patrick Marleau was named a finalist for still playing well into his old age and passing Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL games played record, and Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba was the third finalist for continuing his presence as a co-founder of the Hockey Diversity Alliance and impacting his local community off the ice.
At least something pleasant has come as a result of the 2020-21 Philadelphia Flyers.</span>

Yep, there’s another one!
 You read that right, folks, another Hughes brother has entered the chat. Luke Hughes is finally having his moment, and despite all of the talk around him that’s being circled back to his brothers ad nauseam, he’s been finding quite a bit of success for himself. After a bit of a slow start to his season, he picked up some steam as he went on, and ended up scoring at a cool .88 point per game pace (not too bad for a defenseman, certainly). But his season was cut short when he suffered a lacerated tendon in his foot from a skate cut, which required surgery. It was a tough way to end it, but it was a good year for him overall, and the individual hype he’s garnered because of it is well deserved.

Seth Jones might not be the surefire No. 1 defender that some prop him up to be, but he’s capable of returning to that level of play.
 I’ll preface this article by saying that I would prefer the Flyers to acquire a number of players instead of Seth Jones if they’re looking to fill the role of a top pair defender this offseason (they ought to be). Personally, the addition of any among Ryan Ellis, Dougie Hamilton, Mattias Ekholm, or John Klingberg would make me happier than seeing a blockbuster Jones trade on draft day. This is not an article advocating for the acquisition of Jones, so please don’t interpret it that way.
With all of that said, Seth Jones receives entirely too much vitriol from the analytics community when he’s a player who …</span>

“Conference” final time!
 It’s chaos time, folks! We’re down to the final four in the playoffs, and none of these teams have seen each other all year, so this is surely going to be... interesting, to put it lightly. The playoffs have been weird so far, and they’re only going to get weirder, it seems. Is it a fool’s errand to try and make any kind of prediction here? Maybe, but that’s certainly not going to stop us from trying. 
Tampa Bay Lightning vs. New York Islanders

Maddie: I want to pick the Lightning here, because I think they’re the better team and that should win out and be the end of it. But I also think the Bruins are a better team than the Islanders and should have knocked them out last round, and we saw what happened there. But I&#x27;m g…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The all-knowing Elliotte Friedman reported yesterday morning that Carolina has given Dougie Hamilton permission to shop himself around. And as such, that’s all anyone is talking about. [Sportsnet]
*The Flyers are almost certainly going to be in on Dougie. But so will a lot of other teams. Some more suited for him than others. [The Hockey News]
*Until he signs somewhere else or until Chuck tells us he isn’t coming here, the Flyers are going to be high on the list of potential suitors for the defenseman. [ProHockeyTalk]
*What if... what if the Flyers just trade for him now? [BSH]
*But on to the BIG news. The BIG BIG Flyers news. [BSH]
*Apart from that, it’s all Lappy all the time around here. Ian Laperriere plans to bring positive energy to the Phantoms organization, which was apparently lacking under Scott Gordon. Can’t hurt! [Flyers]
*Not JUST sunshine and rainbows though. Also hard work. Lots and lots of hard work. [Inquirer]
*And finally, just to brighten your day a little bit... the Flyers are in a bad spot. Or a really good one. Depends on what they do here. [BSH]</span>

Officially licensed to ‘fuck shit up’ says Evil Geniuses’ MK11 star
 Five-time EVO champion SonicFox now has their own plushie. “This furry gremlin has been signed off by SonicFox to officially fuck shit up,” says the merch store for Evil Geniuses, SonicFox’s club since last spring.
The plushie is 10 by 11 by 4 inches, 100% polyester, and “Modeled after the ‘Defender of Trans Rights’ themselves,” says the plushie’s product page. “The community begged for it; SonicFox listened.” And that, as they say, is that.
SonicFox (real name Dominique McLean) was named Esports Player of the Year at The Game Awards 2018. In 2019, after coming out as non-binary, their 72-hour Mortal Kombat livestream raised $22,000 for The Trevor Project, a national advocacy organization focusing on LGBTQ persons under age 25. Active since 2013, SonicFox joined Evil Geniuses in March 2020, shortly after winning Mortal Kombat Final Kombat 20.
Most recently SonicFox took first place and a $15,000 prize in WePlay Esports Ultimate Fighting League’s Mortal Kombat 11 tournament, a Tier 1 event held in March. They prevailed 5-4 and 5-1 in the grand final using The Joker against Sayed “Tekken Master” Hashim Ahmed, playing as Cetrion.</span>

 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is heading into a new season with a patch that’s full of new content, plus a couple of balance changes for good measure.
The biggest new addition with the patch is probably coming to Zombies mode with the new Mauer der Toten round-based map. Unlike the Outbreak mode with its massive map, Mauer der Toten will be more of a traditional Zombies experience, including a return to Berlin. If Outbreak is more your style, there’s also a new Zoo area for that mode as well. Finally, both Outbreak and Mauer der Toten will have Easter eggs that kick off on Thursday, June 17.

Oh good, I can play Monkey Target again
 The first three Super Monkey Ball games, Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, are getting an HD remaster. Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania will launch worldwide on Oct. 5 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Super Monkey Ball franchise, as announced by a release from Sega.
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania will come to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. It will cost $39.99 for the console version and $29.99 for the PC version. 
The remaster brings back the original three games with updated graphics and additional, modern features like online challenges and leaderboards. It also introduces a comic book-style of storytelling and new playable characters. Key features of the original, like 4-player local co-op will still be present in the remaster. Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania recreates roughly 300 levels and 12 minigames from the first three games.
In the Super Monkey Ball franchise, players navigate a monkey in a hamster ball while playing sports-inspired minigames or perilous and zany obstacle courses. The first two games launched in the early 2000s  exclusively to the GameCube. The franchise has since launched on numerous platforms, consoles to mobile versions, with more than a dozen titles.
Sega also announced a Digital Deluxe version of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. It will feature six additional classic character skins, three legendary console skins, 10 customizable items and the classic soundtrack. Fans will also be able to grab a special 20th Anniversary Edition of the game that includes an art book, reversible cover, collectable sleeve and 10 cosmetic items. The Digital Deluxe edition will retail for $49.99.</span>

                    <span>The horror game was originally released on the Wii U
 The most recent game in the Fatal Frame series is getting a modern update with Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water for Nintendo Switch and other modern consoles. The new version of the game was revealed during Nintendo’s E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. 
The game takes place on the fictional Hikami Mountain where players control several different characters as they attempt to survive the notoriously supernatural mountain and the variety of hostile spirits and ghosts that occupy it. Each of the game’s protagonists lends a different prospective to the game’s overall story of Ose Kurosawa, a mysterious shrine maiden who was chosen to be part of a powerful and dark ritual. 
Maiden of Black Water is the fifth mainline game in the Fatal Frame series and was originally released in 2014 on Wii U. Just like all of the games in the series, this one focuses on a series of supernatural experiences and spirits that can only be warded off by using a special camera, called the Camera Obscura. The new version of the game will also come with new costumes and photo modes that weren’t in the original, as well as updated visuals.
Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X sometime later this year.</span>

                    <span>For the New Yorker, Hannah Fry wrote a brief history of information visualization, a quiet innovation that has changed the world:
Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, “only a graph speaks directly to the eyes.” Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them — and the stakes dependent on those differences — became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, “If the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.”
Van Langren’s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study “Visual Explanations” (1997), “Maps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.” Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error — how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.


Van Langren’s graph, which Fry says “might be the first statistical graph in history”, is pictured at the top of this post.

                    <span>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union controlled the music recording industry and even restricted the types of music that were allowed to be played &amp; listened to. Or they tried to anyway. Enterprising Soviet bootleggers took used x-ray films, many of them still containing images of bones and skulls, and recorded forbidden music on them, including jazz and rock &amp; roll from the West. They called it ribs, bones, bone music, or jazz on ribs. From a 2017 article in Vice:
X-rays proved to be an suitable medium. They were cheaply and easily (albeit illegally) acquired from local hospitals that were required to throw out the flammable sheets. They took the groove relatively well, though nowhere near as well as vinyl — some X-ray discs apparently sound like listening to music through sand — and they were easy to fold into a shirt sleeve of pocket for a quick transaction. The X-rays were also stunningly beautiful.


And from an NPR article on Soviet samizdat:
Before the availability of the tape recorder and during the 1950s, when vinyl was scarce, ingenious Russians began recording banned bootlegged jazz, boogie woogie and rock ‘n’ roll on exposed X-ray film salvaged from hospital waste bins and archives.
“Usually it was the Western music they wanted to copy,” says Sergei Khrushchev. “Before the tape recorders they used the X-ray film of bones and recorded music on the bones, bone music.”
“They would cut the X-ray into a crude circle with manicure scissors and use a cigarette to burn a hole,” says author Anya von Bremzen. “You’d have Elvis on the lungs, Duke Ellington on Aunt Masha’s brain scan - forbidden Western music captured on the interiors of Soviet citizens.”


To learn more about bone music, you can check out Stephen Coates’ book X-Ray Audio, The X-Ray Audio Project (which includes digital recordings made from some of the bone records — here’s Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald), and this short documentary:

                    <span>pOrtal is a project that allows for people in two different locations to interact via circular video screens. Right now, the link is between Vilnius, Lithuania and Lublin, Poland but there are plans to add more cities (Reykjavik/Vilnius and Vilnius/London to start). The production is a bit over-the-top (e.g. the video), but the idea of fun, seamless, sci-fi presence between two locations is a good one. (via moss &amp; fog)

                    <span>Popular iOS and Mac-based journaling app Day One has been acquired by Automattic, a company best known for running WordPress.com. News of the acquisition was announced today on the Day One blog.





The Day One app will continue to be run separately, and Day One founder Paul Mayne will continue to lead the Day One team. Day One will be updated in the future with integrations with WordPress.com and Tumblr, but will otherwise remain largely the same.
When a small software company is acquired by a larger company, the original team is often swallowed up by the larger company. That&#x27;s not the case here. I&#x27;ll be remaining at the helm of Day One, leading the same passionate team that has been responsible for the development and design behind the app today. This means that the Day One you rely on to save your thoughts, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more isn&#x27;t going away. Instead, it&#x27;ll only get better, with future integrations with Tumblr and WordPress.com. Rest assured there are no current plans to change the privacy of Day One; safely protecting memories and creating a 100% personal space is the foundation upon which this company was built.
Day One&#x27;s privacy policies will remain in place, as will all of the app features for recording thoughts, photos, videos, and more. Day One offers cross-platform compatibility, end-to-end encryption, and Markdown support, and it&#x27;s long been a key app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.



Day One is free to use, but there is a premium membership that adds unlimited photos and videos, plus audio recordings. Day One Premium is priced at $3.99 per month and the app can be downloaded from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Some M1 iMacs appear to have a manufacturing defect that causes the display to be mounted on the stand in a way that&#x27;s not perfectly aligned, leading to a crooked display.





YouTuber iPhonedo over the weekend published a review of the ‌M1‌ iMac, and he found that his machine appeared to be tilted on one side, a mounting disparity that was visibly noticeable and proved with a ruler.






Another person on the Apple Support Communities also complained of a non-level display with a 1mm disparity between the right and the left sides of the display, and there was a third complaint on Reddit, with the person in that situation discovering the issue after watching iPhonedo&#x27;s video.
Checked mine after watching this and it&#x27;s also crooked.

Not to the degree of his, but not complete…</span>

                    <span>Nomad, known for its range of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the Card for AirTag, which is designed to make it easier for an AirTag to fit inside a wallet for tracking purposes.





With Card for AirTag, an AirTag fits inside the middle of a card-shaped holder that&#x27;s then meant to fit inside of a wallet. According to Nomad, the design offers a smooth, uniform shape that allows the AirTag to be kept in the wallet without having a circular bump.



The Card for AirTag is made from a polycarbonate material with a soft-touch TPU surface, and the AirTag is designed to snap into the middle.





It&#x27;s worth noting that the AirTag is quite thick on its own and not really designed for use within wallets, so this Card for AirTag is still going to take up a lot of space. Thin wallets may not accommodate the thickness of the AirTag and the accompanying Card accessory.



The Card for AirTag is priced at $20, but there&#x27;s a $5 discount when bundled with one of Nomad&#x27;s wallets. Nomad is also today releasing new Bi-Fold and Card wallets priced starting at $69.95. The Card for AirTag and the new wallets can be purchased from the Nomad website.

Sunflower is a bright yellow shade, cloud blue is a soft, light blue, and electric orange is a bright orange that&#x27;s darker than the kumquat color and more orange than pink citrus.



The new cases are priced starting at $49, like all Apple silicone cases, and can be ordered from the Apple website as of today.

                    <span>Apple today released new iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 updates, with the new software aimed at older devices that are unable to run the iOS 14 update that&#x27;s available on modern devices.





The iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 updates can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, iOS 12.5.4 introduces important security updates and is recommended for all users. Apple often releases security updates for older devices that are no longer able to get the current version of iOS in order to keep users protected from malware and other security vulnerabilities.



Apple&#x27;s security support document says that the update addresses three vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Two of them that affected WebKit may have been actively exploited. One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.

iOS and iPadOS 14.7 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or over the air after the proper profile has been installed on an iPhone or iPad.



The new iOS and iPadOS 14.7 updates may be focused on under-the-hood bug performance improvements and bug fixes for issues that weren&#x27;t able to be addressed in iOS 14.6, but a few minor features have been found.



Apple in iOS 14.7 will expand the Air Quality Index feature to additional countries that include the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. 



When paired with the accompanying HomePod 14.7 software, iOS 14.7 will allow the Home app to set multiple timers on a ‌HomePod‌ or a HomePod mini.

To install the ‌watchOS 7.6 beta, developers need to download the proper configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once the profile is in place, the watchOS 7.5 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software Update.



To update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s included in the watchOS 7.6 update, and no new features were discovered in the first two betas.

Though we don&#x27;t often know what&#x27;s new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve seen a lot of teasers about the Beats Studio Buds over the past month since they first showed up in Apple&#x27;s beta software updates, and today they&#x27;re finally official. The Beats Studio Buds are available to order today in red, white, and black ahead of a June 24 ship date, and they&#x27;re priced at $149.99.





The Studio Buds are the first Beats-branded earbuds to truly compete with AirPods thanks to their wire-free design that fits comfortably in the ear without the over-ear hook seen on Powerbeats Pro.






In many respects, the Studio Buds are competitive with AirPods Pro at a lower price point, with a diminutive design that&#x27;s slightly lighter than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ while still offering features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency modes.

Spatial Audio, based on Dolby Atmos, is an immersive surround sound audio format that enables musicians to mix music so it sounds like the instruments are all around you in space. Thousands of Apple Music songs are available in Spatial Audio as of last week, such as Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Rain on Me&quot; and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Black Skinhead.&quot;



Spatial Audio is available to all Apple Music subscribers at no additional cost. The streaming music service costs $9.99 per month for individuals, $4.99 per month for students, and $14.99 per month for families of up to six people.

Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, the star-studded returning cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, and others.



Apple&#x27;s announcement sets the stage for what to expect in season two:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds &quot;The Morning Show&quot; team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley&#x27;s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.
Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial available. An extended one-year free trial is also available with the purchase of most new Apple devices.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Apple Watch Series 7 is likely to have thinner display bezels and use a new lamination technique that brings the display closer to the front cover, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





From the report:

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is planning to refresh the line this year -- with a model likely dubbed the Apple Watch Series 7 -- by adding a faster processor, improved wireless connectivity and an updated screen, according to people with knowledge of the plans. 



For this year&#x27;s model, Apple has tested thinner display borders and a new lamination technique that brings the display closer to the front cover. The new Watch is likely to be slightly thicker overall, but not in a way that&#x27;s noticeable to the user.
The model will also include updated u…</span>

                    <span>In iOS 15, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the Photos app, such as the ability to see the EXIF data for a photo. The latter feature is accessed via a new &quot;Info&quot; button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.





In addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn&#x27;t take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the HomePod image was saved from the web via Safari. 



This metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the &quot;Saved from&quot; location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don&#x27;t have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll. 



The new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you&#x27;ve saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.



‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.

Up until recently, the black model was sold out in the U.S. but the white color was available for delivery &quot;while stocks last.&quot; That&#x27;s currently no longer the case, and though Apple&#x27;s white ‌HomePod‌ listing still allows customers to check availability for in-store purchase and pickup, the speaker has been unavailable in nearly all retail locations since the beginning of June.

The Flyers lock up some forward depth in the system.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are getting some offseason business out of the way before the Stanley Cup is handed out. 
Announced on Monday, the team has re-signed forwards German Rubtsov and Linus Sandin to one-year, two-way deals that will carry a league-minimum $750,000 cap hit if they are on the NHL roster.

Fletcher has paid a premium for signing rights before, so why not now when it will be better? Do that same thing again, Chuck.
 Chuck Fletcher has been here before. It’s a darkroom. The only light available to him is a crack in the cement foundation to the left of him. A streak of light beaming across the cold floor, casting a soft glow on the words he etched on the wall across from him. He looks up upon what he has created. It only repeats itself in his waking days until the leaves begin to fall again.
“Underachievement.”
It reads like a hollow message, rattling around in his head ever since the math was made right. Ever since the Philadelphia Flyers were destined to see another team lift the Stanley Cup. Another year without ta…</span>

This is a pivotal offseason for Chuck Fletcher with the Flyers’ veteran core and underperforming youngsters at a crossroads.
 When you look at the Philadelphia Flyers roster, it’s split into a few different groups. 
There is the veteran core made up of a few guys that have been here for years (Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek, Sean Couturier) plus the recent additions (Kevin Hayes, James van Riemsdyk).  All five of those players are 28 years old (or older) with varying contract statuses. The two most valuable Flyers forwards in that group — Giroux and Couturier —have their contracts expire after next season, while the other three are under contract through 2023 (JVR), 2024 (Voracek), and 2026 (Hayes).
This is the veteran core that could be s…</span>

This is the yoke and throttle that you’ve been looking for
 We’ve known that Microsoft Flight Simulator was coming to Xbox consoles for literally years now. This week at E3 Microsoft finally gave us a launch date — July 27. What remained unclear to fans, however, was how they were actually going to fly those airplanes on a console. Sure, you could use an Xbox controller, but the grass is especially green on the PC side of the fence with a boatload of boutique controllers and high-end joysticks. 
Fear not, console pilots, for Turtle Beach has come to your rescue with the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System. It’s a full-fledged yoke and throttle compatible with Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Windows 10. The announcement was made Monday in a n…</span>

Capcom says DLC is now in development
 The story of Resident Evil Village will continue in a new expansion, Capcom announced Tuesday during its E3 2021 showcase. By popular demand, Capcom said, “development has just started” on additional DLC for the game. 
Unfortunately, Capcom did not provide details about its plans, but promised more info at a later date.
Resident Evil Village producer Tsuyoshi Kanda said that players will have something to look forward to next month, however. Kanda announced that Resident Evil RE: Verse, the deathmatch multiplayer mode that features heroes and bioweapons from the Resident Evil franchise, will go live in July after a brief delay.
The previous game in the franchise, Resident Evil 7 biohazard, received a number of post-release story-based add-ons, including Banned Footage Vol. 1 and 2, Not A Hero starring Chris Redfield, and End of Zoe.
Resident Evil Village was released in May for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. In our review of the first-person survival-horror game, we called Village’s blend of gunplay and scares “the perfect cocktail of horror and action.”</span>

Still green, though
 Microsoft is, apparently, changing the game cases for Xbox titles. Box art seen at Best Buy and other retailers more prominently calls out the compatible platforms while eschewing the embossed Xbox logo that fronted game cases since the launch of Xbox One.
It’s a subtle change and, considering how many full copy sales of video games take place online today, one that some may not notice for a while. It also seems necessary considering Microsoft is supporting two consoles and, the Xbox Series X’s backward compatibility notwithstanding, some games are in fact Series X only.
Microsoft has long aspired to unify its video games presence under a single brand, but it still can’t quite seal the deal. Xbox games are sold on The Microsoft Store, for example, while PC subscribers peruse the Xbox Game Pass for PC library. And let us never speak of Games for Widows Live, which Microsoft needed two years to finally shut down.
Bottom line to you, the consumer: Not much, really. The design change probably means Microsoft saves a few cents stamping the Xbox logo on the top. We now return you to your regularly scheduled E3.</span>

 Xbox fans wondering why Rare’s Everwild didn’t show up at Sunday’s E3 showcase now have an answer: The studio has “completely rebooted” the open-world adventure game under a new creative director, and its release is multiple years away, reports Video Games Chronicle.
Citing sources with knowledge of Everwild’s development, VGC reports that Rare has undertaken “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction” following the departure last fall of its previous creative director, Simon Woodroffe. Gregg Mayles — who has worked at Rare for more than three decades, and is the studio’s most senior employee on the creative side, according to VGC — has been tapped as creative director for the ongoing reboot, VGC repo…</span>

The update will also include new zombies content and new maps
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting a new season in just a few days and Treyarch has finally given fans a preview of what they can expect. According to the new  roadmap, season 4 will have a new round-based Zombies map, new weapons, new maps, and another update to Verdansk — just not quite as big as the last one. 
The new addition to Verdansk will be a new location centered around a crashed satellite — the focus of the season’s reveal trailer, which debuted during Summer Games Fest last week. It seems that the crash will take out some existing structures, but is also big enough for players to fight in and around. Meanwhile, Verdansk’s season 3 Reloaded addition of the Nak…</span>

Computer, enhance
 Bethesda Softworks formally unveiled Starfield, its highly anticipated new role-playing game, on Sunday during the Xbox showcase. And in a surprise twist, eagle-eyed fans on Reddit have found what they think could be a teaser for Bethesda Game Studios’ next new game: The Elder Scrolls 6. We’ve seen the evidence, and ... yeah. There could definitely be a big, fat Easter egg hidden in plain sight.
[Warning: This story could contain spoilers for the next game in The Elder Scrolls series of single-player RPGs.]

Jack wants chaos? Jack gets chaos
 Square Enix revealed a new spinoff Final Fantasy game at its E3 2021 press conference on Sunday, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin. And while a new Final Fantasy game might sound like exciting news at a conference thin with announcements, fans were quick to notice a fatal flaw with its protagonist, Jack. 
He wears a T-shirt.  
He dons a simple, black, short-sleeved shirt with buttons on the front. If it weren’t for the ragged hem hanging down over his crotch and butt, it looks like something you could buy from the men’s section at Target. It might sound like a small thing, but this is the world of Final Fantasy, where everybody and their mom usually has an ornate, whimsical character designs. And Jack is the protagonist…</span>

PlatinumGames’ latest looks a little rough around the edges, but there’s hope
 On Sunday, Square Enix showed off new gameplay from Babylon’s Fall, the PlatinumGames-developed hack-and-slash that was first announced way back in 2018. It looked drastically different from the early gameplay preview we saw in late 2019, which made Babylon’s Fall look like a fairly traditional PlatinumGames release.
It also, frankly, looked a little ... off. What I (and others) perceived as heavily compressed streaming video artifacts obscuring the game’s graphics is actually Babylon’s Fall’s intentional art style. PlatinumGames says it’s going for a “visual style is based on classical European oil paintings” that it calls “brushwork style.” To wit, taking a closer look at direct-feed screenshots of Babylon’s Fall reveals that the graphics are being treated with a canvas-like texture and what appear to be actual brushstrokes.
“Our goal was to create a deeply layered, high quality fantasy world rendered in the oil painting style seen in classic sword and sorcery fantasy works,” said Babylon’s Fall game director Kenji Saito in a behind-the-scenes look at development.


PlatinumGames and Square Enix tapped artist Kouji Tajima to create the game’s high-fantasy art style. Tajima’s previous work is mostly in live-action film, he says, working on movies like Terminator: Dark Fate, Venom, Blade Runner 2049, and the Fantastic Beasts series.
The most encouraging bit of news on Babylon’s Fall is who’s overseeing it, the aforementioned game director Kenji Saito. He directed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Transformers Devastation, two of Platinum’s better games. He’s joined by Isao Negishi, lead game designer on Babylon’s Fall, who had the same credit on Nier: Automata.
Babylon’s Fall is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam. Square Enix has not announced a release date.</span>

Halo multiplayer is all about hunting for power weapons
 Players got some new details around Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer during 343 Industries and Microsoft’s Halo multiplayer livestream on Monday. The livestream showed off a little more than 10 minutes of new gameplay and developer interviews. It gave 343 Industries an opportunity to deliver its philosophy for Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer: old school.
Early in the stream, 343 Industries developers made it clear that players will start on equal footing with “fair and balanced starts,” and that they wanted to go back to the old-school Halo style of hunting for power weapons once you spawn. However, it’s not currently clear if Halo Infinite will have loadouts.

Infinite will also give players more customization options than ever, including the AI voice in multiplayer
 343 Industries is totally reshaping Halo’s multiplayer customization in Halo Infinite by adding a few hallmarks of popular free-to-play games. The studio released a multiplayer overview on Monday, where it revealed what players could expect for all the game’s cosmetics when it comes out later this year. 
Because Infinite is the first Halo game to feature free-to-play multiplayer, it’s no surprise that the team at 343 is ramping up cosmetics and customization. Not only does it give the developer more items to sell, but Infinite is inviting players to spend hundreds of hours in the Halo arena, and with time investment like that it’s always more fu…</span>

Studio Fizbin’s thoughtful puzzle-platformer got a surprise release on Sunday
 You’ve heard this story before. Though the details may be different, the thrust of the story is the same. When the world goes to shit, there’s only one person who can save us — the chosen one, through their sheer power of chosen-ness, must set off on a calamitous journey to stop whatever terrible thing is threatening the world. 
It’s Link in the Legend of Zelda, Master Chief in Halo, Kratos in God of War. These sorts of heroes also appear in smaller-scale stories, in more intimate worlds, like the player-character in Cozy Grove, perpetually taking on everyone else’s needs. But being a hero can be isolating, even traumatic.

Coming to PC and consoles in 2022
 PC gamers itching for a Pikmin-like fix have Tinykin to look forward to in 2022. The game, from developer Splashteam, stars a tiny protagonist and a small army of helpful insects — the titular Tinykin — was revealed Sunday during the PC Gaming Show.
Here’s the narrative setup for Tinykin:
It’s the year 2748 and Milo has re-discovered Earth! He’d go down in history for this achievement, but when he lands on the planet he encounters a problem... He’s as small as a penny. And everybody’s gone. And it’s the ’90s.

As Milo, players will explore a giant house, using Tinykin to maneuver through an oversized world by building ladders, bridges, carrying objects, and more. Milo can also jump, skate, and grind, as you can see in the game’s debut trailer above.
Tinykin is coming to Windows PC and unannounced consoles next year. Developer Splashteam is composed of ex-Ubisoft developers who have worked on the Rayman and Rabbids franchises.</span>

The game won’t be free-to-play after all
 Icarus, the next game from DayZ creator Dean Hall’s Rocketwerkz studio, launches on Steam Aug. 11. In a surprise announcement, the session-based multiplayer survival game will not be free-to-play. Instead the game will cost $29.99, and will be released in chapters. The announcement was made Sunday during the PC Gaming Show presentation, and was accompanied by a new trailer.
“We didn’t want the business model to get in the way of the game experience,” Hall said in a news release. “We also heard loud and clear from our community that they wanted to avoid the pitfalls of free-to-play. We want Icarus to continually evolve as a living game, always adding new session challenges and game modes. We think regular chapters and content updates are a great way to deliver.” 
Icarus puts players in the role of pioneering explorers trying to tame a wild, alien world. The session-based gameplay puts a time limit on each mission, challenging players to gather resources before their ship back to orbit leaves them behind. You can read more, including an interview with Dean Hall, in our hands-on preview. 
A deluxe edition, which will include two follow-on chapters of downloadable content, will also be available for $99.95.</span>

 Far: Changing Tides is the next game from Okomotive, a small independent studio out of Switzerland. The sequel to Far: Lone Sails, the award-winning game released in 2018, the game was announced Sunday as part of the PC Gaming Show. It will be published by Frontier Foundry, the new publishing arm of Frontier Developments (Elite Dangerous, Jurassic World Evolution).
Where Lone Sails asked players to navigate a sailing ship across a a long, dry expanse of land, Changing Tides takes place on the sea. Players will take control of a hero named Toe and must help them as they make their way through a drowning landscape. Players should expect a “meditative side scrolling” game with a “haunting soundtrack,” according to a news release.

Not much! But Todd Howard and friends want you to dig
 Starfield is the next large-scale, AAA role-playing game from Fallout and Skyrim makers Bethesda Game Studios. It will launch Nov. 11, 2022. The spacefaring RPG, first teased in 2018, is Bethesda’s biggest all-new video game world in the past 25 years. Here’s what we know about it, so far.
WHAT IS STARFIELD?
“Skyrim in space,” Todd Howard told The Washington Post. Howard is the executive producer for Bethesda Game Studios and the creative leader of its Elder Scrolls franchise since 2000. In other words, this is the full-featured Bethesda Game Studios RPG experience, seen in games like The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and Fallout 5, just applied to an all-new, science fiction setting.

Square Enix is going full character action with a new Final Fantasy spinoff
 Ninja Gaiden and Nioh developer Team Ninja is making a new Final Fantasy spinoff game for Square Enix. Titled Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin and pitched as “a bold new vision for Final Fantasy,” the game is scheduled to launch in 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is being developed by Final Fantasy veterans Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima in conjunction with Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo Games.
Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin appears heavy on action. In the game’s E3 2021 reveal trailer, we see a trio of Warriors of Light battling a variety of creatures and enemies, and, ultimately, the evil knight Garland from the original Final Fantasy. Square Enix’s official description of the game reads: “Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine. Yet doubts remain—are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?”
A trial version of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is available now from the PlayStation Store. It will be available on PlayStation 5 through June 24.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.</span>

From Deck Nine, True Colors is out in September
 Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine revealed more information about the game’s empathy mechanic in a presentation during publisher Square Enix’s E3 presentation Sunday. The next Life is Strange game, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 10, is about a 21-year-old Asian American woman named Alex Chen who moves to Colorado to reunite with her brother Gabe. When her brother mysteriously dies, Alex uses her supernatural power, Empathy, to find out what happened in the quiet mountain town.
The clip shows that Alex has long struggled with these powers; she calls them a curse rather than a gift, oftentimes becoming overwhelmed by others’ feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. Over the course of t…</span>

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The trailer page says War for Wakanda will launch in August of this year.</span>

It’s the first official reveal of the Marvel game, which was leaked in 2017
 Years after Eidos-Montréal’s Guardians of the Galaxy game was leaked in 2017, the Deus Ex developer is finally ready to show it off. Publisher Square Enix announced Guardians of the Galaxy, a single-player, third-person adventure game made in partnership with Marvel — part of a multiple-game agreement that included Marvel’s Avengers — during its E3 2021 presentation on Sunday. 
Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 26.
The game draws from existing lore — the movies and comic books — but is a new interpretation of the gang. This is not a movie adaptation, which is quickly noticeable once you’ve se…</span>

                    <span>Apple this week previewed iOS 15, which is available now in beta for developers ahead of a public release later this year. One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.



MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:

Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally 🎉 #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq
— Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021
 
Cross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.



From the iOS 15 features page on Apple&#x27;s website:
Drag and drop

With support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.
To drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.



In many apps, you can drag a single item with one finger, and while dragging, select additional items by tapping them with another finger. The selected items move together and appear stacked beneath the finger that&#x27;s dragging the original item. You can then drag the items as a group and drop them into another app.



The first beta of iOS 15 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and the software update should be released for all compatible iPhones in September.

                    <span>During the Platforms State of the Union at WWDC this week, Apple unveiled a new API for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 that enables developers to implement an on-screen virtual game controller in their iPhone and iPad games with just a few lines of code.





While many iPhone and iPad games already offer on-screen controls, Apple&#x27;s new virtual game controller is available to all developers, easy to add, and can be customized on a per-game basis. Apple said the on-screen controller can be adjusted to a variety of layouts, with up to four buttons and a thumbstick, d-pad, or touchpad available per left and right side.



&quot;These new on-screen controls for iPhone and iPad look amazing, and they&#x27;re carefully tuned for grip locations across hand sizes and for a great responsiveness and feel,&quot; said Nat Brown, an Apple engineer working on Game Technologies.



Apple offers a WWDC session and developer documentation with more details.

                    <span>In a currently unlisted ad on YouTube, Apple is promoting the versatility, portability, and power of the M1 iPad Pro in a fun musical inspired by The Little Mermaid&#x27;s &quot;Part of Your World&quot; soundtrack.






In the ad, which features the main character using an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil, multiple users can be seen struggling with their old PCs indoors while hoping that they can someday use an ‌iPad Pro‌ instead. The lyrics and soundtrack of the ad are completely based around The Little Mermaid&#x27;s &quot;Part of Your World,&quot; but the visuals tell the majority of the story.



In one scene, an office employee using an old Windows PC can be seen looking out at a girl using an ‌iPad Pro‌ with the Magic Keyboard in a park while singing &quot;up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun.&quot; The ad ends with all the characters singing &quot;wish I could be, part of that world,&quot; referencing the world of using an ‌iPad Pro‌. 



The ad, uploaded on June 4, is currently unlisted on YouTube, meaning only those with a link will be able to watch it. It&#x27;s unclear why Apple has decided not to make it public or if it plans to in the near future.

 Federighi kicks off the conversation discussing the common architecture, now thanks to Apple silicon, across all of Apple&#x27;s devices and platforms ranging from the Mac to the Apple Watch. Federighi notes how this unity allows developers to scale their apps to more devices and ultimately more users.

Devolver Forwarder promises wackiness
 Publisher Devolver Digital brings its singular brand of video game publisher zaniness to E3 2021 (or at least close to it) with a new livestream on Saturday, June 12. Dubbed the Devolver MaxPass+ stream, the event promises new looks at upcoming games, including gameplay for Shadow Warrior 3 and Death’s Door.
Devolver MaxPass+ (aka Devolver Forwarder) kicks off at 4:30 p.m. EDT/1:30 p.m. PDT, and will stream on Twitch. Devolver Digital promises five new game reveals from its stable of developers including Flying Wild Hog, Galvanic Games, and Doinksoft, as well as release date announcements for Phantom Abyss and Death’s Door. 
And if this year’s Devolver Digital showcase, which is unaffiliated with E3 2021, is like years past, there will be kooky, surreal, and possibly extremely gory sketches.</span>

New Avatar game set for 2022 release
 Ubisoft has unveiled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a first-person action-adventure game set in James Cameron’s Avatar universe. A new trailer highlighted the game’s central conflict, focusing on air-to-air combat between humans and the Na’vi.
First announced in February 2017, we now know the game has been built on Ubisoft’s proprietary Snowdrop Engine — the same technology that underpins The Division. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, in partnership with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney itself.
“In this new, standalone story,” Ubisoft says in the game’s description, “play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back on the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.”

The release window is listed a 2022. The game is being developed for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. It will also be available on Stadia and Luna.</span>

The Siege of Paris follows Wrath of the Druids
 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s developers have post-launch support planned “well into” the game’s second year. Highlights, announced during the Ubisoft Forward livestream on Saturday, include a story expansion called The Siege of Paris, and an educational Discovery Tour mode similar to the ones made for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey.
Ubisoft did not give a specific launch date for The Siege of Paris, other than to say it would arrive this summer. The game’s first premium expansion, The Wrath of the Druids, just launched in May. That chapter took place in Ireland; this one takes players to France for “the most ambitious battle in Viking history,” Ubisoft’s Karen Lee told viewers. 
The Siege of Paris is premium content, and will be available a la carte or with the game’s Season Pass. The new chapter also brings back “black box” missions, in which the player is given only a single infiltration objective. How they complete the task is entirely up to them.
The Viking Age Discovery Tour, like its two predecessors, will be a free update to all with the game. It’s a combat-free exploration mode and, like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s tour, it will allow users to create and pursue role-playing missions for the world’s inhabitants.
Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla launched in November on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna services.</span>

Siege is also getting a new Operator called Thunderbird
 Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer shooters around on both console and PC and it’s finally getting cross-play ... but with some caveats. The announcement  came at Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation on Saturday.
On June 30, Ubisoft will add cross-play and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege between all of its various PC platforms including standard PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna. Players from all three platforms will be able to queue into games together. For consoles, cross-play will be released in early 2022, when players on PlayStation and Xbox will be able to jump into games together. It does not appear that Ubisoft will let PC and console players compete together, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise.

According to Ubisoft’s announcement, these updates will also include cross-progression across “all platforms” as part of one unified account, so you can earn rewards no matter where you’re playing. 


Right after the announcement of cross-play and cross-progression, Ubisoft also gave fans a new look at the game’s newest Defensive Operator, Thunderbird. The Thunderbird preview came in the form of an gorgeous animated trailer where the new Operator takes on a bear with a flare gun and lives to tell the tale. 
Thunderbird will be available as part of Siege’s North Star update and event, which starts next week on June 14.</span>

Ubisoft announces Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph as playable characters
 Far Cry 6’s season pass will add three villains from previous Far Cry games as playable characters, Ubisoft announced at its E3 2021 press conference Saturday. As seen in the trailer above, Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3, Pagan Min from Far Cry 4, and Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5 will be playable characters in post-release content for Far Cry 6.
The content appears dreamlike or hallucinogenic in nature, giving Ubisoft a narrative out for its Far Cry 6 DLC. Not that it’s ever really needed one; Far Cry 3 went full weird with its Blood Dragon DLC and Far Cry 5’s post-release content had players fighting zombies and Martian monsters, after all.
The season pass content also includes Far Cry 3’s DLC Blood Dragon.
The revelation that Vaas, Pagan, and Joseph will return for Far Cry 6 certainly helps make sense of a tease from actor Michael Mando, the face and voice of Vaas, who said in 2020, “Vaas is my spirit animal - having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me. I still get recognized as Vaas, and I still feel the outpouring of love for that character - makes me very happy. Who knows... maybe I will reprise the role very soon?”
Far Cry 6, by Ubisoft Toronto, launches Oct. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and Google’s Stadia and Amazon’s Luna platforms. The game stars Giancarlo Esposito as the primary antagonist; he is El Presidente, Anton Castillo, the autocratic ruler determined to crush an uprising bent on regime change. Our preview from two weeks ago has more.
Update: This story has been updated with confirmation from Ubisoft.</span>

Season Pass owners can add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec cells
 Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline, the story expansion for those who bought the game’s premium season pass, will launch July 6, Ubisoft said on Saturday. The story brings back Aiden Pearce from the first Watch Dogs and Wrench from the second as playable characters.
Pearce, according to Ubisoft’s news release, has come to London to reconnect with his nephew, Jackson. He’s supposed to infiltrate a Broca Tech lab and steal some cutting edge technology — but Wrench gets the device first and flees. With his job botched, Pearce and his nephew are now on the lam from those who hired him.
Ubisoft’s statement says Bloodline is a prequel to the main campaign of Watch Dogs: Legion. It will also offer several side quests for both characters to complete.
Watch Dogs: Legion — Bloodline is available a la carte for $14.99 to those without the Season Pass. The Season Pass, $29.99 if you didn’t get it with one of two premium editions in the game’s October 2020 launch, lets players add Aiden Pearce and Wrench to their DedSec Resistance club, whether in the single-player tour or the multiplayer Watch Dogs: Legion Online mode that launched in March.
Watch Dogs: Legion launched Oct. 29 for Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, with versions for Amazon’s Luna service, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X added later.
Post-launch content, both free and premium, was delayed both by development challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and other glitches and fixes necessary in the main game. The first piece of premium Season Pass content, which launched in early May, included a new mission for the single-player campaign and special playable operative. On June 1, Ubisoft Toronto released a new, free mode for the PC version of the game, Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead, which pits online players against a zombie horde.</span>

Tactical alien action with Rainbow Six operators
 Rainbow Six is getting back to its tactical co-op roots, sort of. The newest entry in the series is Rainbow Six Extraction and it will pit players against hordes of mutated aliens, but ... tactically. The game’s latest footage was shown on Saturday during Ubisoft’s E3 2021 presentation. 
The trailer starts off by giving us a bit of background on where the alien nightmare came from. An asteroid crashes to Earth and starts infecting people all around the world. The trailer then follows a small squad of special ops soldiers from around the world as they try to extra one of their own from the hands of the aliens. Things seem to be going well, before the squad gets ambushed by an Apex and a few other special aliens that seem more dangerous than the rest. 


Rainbow Six Extraction was originally announced in 2019 as a spin-off for Rainbow Six Siege’s Outbreak mode, a co-op mode where players fought through hordes of mutant AI enemies — instead of the series’ usual vague terrorists. The game was also originally going to be called Rainbow Six Quarantine, but after 2020’s pandemic, Ubisoft changed the name to Extraction. Extraction is developed by a new team at Ubisoft Montreal. 
Just like Outbreak, the new Rainbow Six game blends the series’ tactical slow-paced roots with the character-based action of the Rainbow Six Siege. Extraction will let players hunt down — or escape from — infected aliens together as a squad of up to three, similar to the earliest games in the series, but will let players do this while playing as the unique Operators that players already know and love from Siege — including characters like Ela, Ash, and Hibana.  
Rainbow Six Extraction is set to be released on  is set to be released on Sept. 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will also include cross-play, letting players squad up across different platforms.</span>

Gearbox has Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands movie, and more in store
 Borderlands developer Gearbox Software is heading to E3 2021 armed with a new game, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands — the high-fantasy spinoff of its shooter-looter series — and a new movie. Gearbox fans expect to hear more about Borderlands — the Eli Roth-directed movie starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Jamie Lee Curtis — during its E3 Showcase on Saturday.
Gearbox Entertainment will take over the official E3 2021 livestream on Saturday, June 12 at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT. The event, which is expected to run about 30 minutes, will stream on E3’s YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter channels.
Beyond Wonderlands and Borderlands, don’t be surprised if a few Gearbox Publishing titles also get some attention during Gearbox’s E3 showcase. Norsfell and Gearbox announced earlier this week that co-op action survival RPG Tribes of Midgard will launch July 27 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via Steam.

Registration for PC beta begins today
 Ubisoft’s 10-year-old Rocksmith franchise will become an “interactive music learning subscription service,” with its next entry, Rocksmith Plus. That’s according to an email that guitar maker Gibson let slip before Ubisoft could announce the video game at its E3 keynote on Saturday.
Per the marketing email, Ubisoft is apparently partnering with Gibson again, as the company’s Epiphone, Kramer, and Gibson models of acoustic, electric, or bass guitars are specifically mentioned as compatible. A closed beta on PC will also begin soon, with registration open today.

      A gif included with the email Gibson sent today.
  
Newcomers and returning musicians will find “an expansive library” of songs in Rocksmith Plus’s catalog. The program’s Riff Repeater, which can control a song’s speed to help players practice, also returns.
The first Rocksmith launched in 2011 but only for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That was followed two years later by Rocksmith 2014, considered a replacement rather than a sequel. That game launched for PC platforms in addition to the two consoles, and their successors.
Rocksmith 2014’s song library included 66 playable tracks on the disc, with more available as downloadable content. Saturday’s email did not specify how many songs would be available with the base game, or how deep the subscription service runs, or its pricing, for that matter.
Update: Ubisoft formally announced Rocksmith Plus at Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward event. The game still does not have a release date. During a presentation, Ubisoft said Rocksmith Plus players will also be able to use something called Rocksmith Workshop to create and add their own guitar arrangements to the game.</span>

                    <span>Photographer Sails Chong recorded something we don’t hear much of these days: the sounds of camera shutters. Accompanied by a song by Arcade Fire from the Her soundtrack, Chong presents the shutter sounds of 18 different cameras, from 35mm all the way up to large format cameras. Interestingly, the lineup does not include the iconic Leica shutter sound — “a photograph sounds like a kiss”. (thx, david)

                    <span>As part of the Tech Support series, Wired had Yo-Yo Ma answer some questions about the cello and music sent in by Twitter users. What I like about this is that no critic or professional interviewer would ask these questions (they are “bad” interview questions) and yet Ma answers them all generously and thoughtfully. It reminds me a little bit of when Vogue trained an AI program to interview Billie Eilish:
What I really loved hearing Billie say was that human interviewers often ask the same questions over and over, and she appreciated that the AI questions don’t have an agenda in the same way, they’re not trying to get anything from her.


Perhaps with interesting subjects who are game, having “good” interview questions maybe isn’t that important, particularly if they are repeated queried about the same topics in every interview.

                    <span>macOS Monterey makes several improvements to password management, positioning iCloud Keychain as an ideal password service to replace third-party services like Lastpass and 1Password.





In System Preferences, there&#x27;s a new &quot;Passwords&quot; section that houses all of your ‌iCloud‌ Keychain logins and passwords so they&#x27;re easier to get to, edit, and manage. There&#x27;s a similar Passwords section that&#x27;s been on iOS for some time now, so now there&#x27;s one streamlined way to access your passwords across Apple devices.





Prior to now, passwords on Mac were accessible through the Preferences interface in Safari, but the System Preferences option is easier to find. As with the prior version of the feature, Safari will suggest passwords automatically and detect compromised passwords for you…</span>

                    <span>On his newly launched Front Page Tech website, leaker Jon Prosser has shared renders showing off the alleged design of the next-generation iPad mini, which he says are based on schematics, CAD files, and real images of the device.





In line with details shared earlier this month by Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu, Prosser claims that the new iPad mini will feature slimmer bezels around the display and no home button, with Touch ID relocated to the power button like the latest iPad Air. The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with &quot;dramatically improved&quot; speakers.



According to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.





The report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and Bloomberg has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.



Prosser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the new iMac would be available in a variety of colors, but he was mostly recently wrong about a new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC this week.

                    <span>U.S. House lawmakers today announced sweeping bipartisan antitrust legislation that could result in major changes to the tech industry, impacting companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.





These measures are the culmination of a 16-month antitrust investigation into tech companies practices that kicked off in 2019, and which saw Apple CEO Tim Cook testify in an antitrust hearing alongside Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.



At the conclusion of that hearing, which took place in July 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee leading the inquiry released a 450 page report with recommendations that have turned into the new antitrust bills that were proposed today. The five bills are aimed at Apple, …</span>

If you zoom all the way out in the Maps app you can get to an interactive globe view, which is new to Maps. You can rotate the globe and drill down into different areas around the world, and Apple has greatly enhanced the details you see for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, and oceans.

                    <span>As part of its annual survey given to developers at the end of WWDC, Apple is asking community members whether, following two years of the conference behind held in a digital format, they would be open to attending an in-person conference.

Due to the global health crisis, Apple has held its typically in-person Worldwide Developers Conference in an all-digital format for the past two years. The digital format, which includes a pre-recorded keynote from Apple Park and several sessions available online for free, has been loved by many in the community due to its openness and inclusiveness.



Unlike the in-person conference, the online format has allowed Apple to reach millions more developers and users worldwide. Now, as the world begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel, Apple is possibly planning to return to an in-person conference next year while still retaining some aspects of a digital format. 



One of the questions as part of this year&#x27;s end of WWDC survey reads, &quot;How likely would you be to attend an in-person conference after experiencing an all-online event?&quot; 



While not totally indicative, it is worth noting that Apple is beginning to receive and collect feedback regarding the community&#x27;s outlook towards possibly returning to the in-person conference. Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple is contemplating the idea, and does plan to hold its first in-person event since the global health crisis began in the coming months.

Priced at $55, the Lululook Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand is an adjustable mount for the ‌iPad‌. Apple&#x27;s modern iPads attach magnetically to the stand, putting the ‌iPad‌ at an ideal viewing angle for pairing with a keyboard, drawing, watching shows, and more.



The stand features strong built-in magnets that ensure the ‌iPad‌ is perfectly aligned when it&#x27;s put in place, and anti-slip silicone keeps the ‌iPad‌ from being scratched.





You can use the Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand in either landscape or portrait mode, and it has a 360-degree adjustable angle so you can position it any way that you want.

                    <span>After years of neglect, Adobe is removing its free &quot;Photoshop Mix&quot; and &quot;Photoshop Fix&quot; apps from the App Store on June 21, 2021.





Adobe made the announcement in an update to its FAQ page for each of the apps. On the pages, Adobe says that both apps will be removed from the App Store on June 21, and advises users who used the apps to switch to using its &quot;Photoshop Express Photo Editor,&quot; which requires either a monthly or yearly subscription for deeper photo editing.



Photoshop Mix was released on the App Store prior to when a fully-fledged version of Photoshop arrived on the iPad. It was Adobe&#x27;s attempt to offer iPad users at the time some level of photo editing capabilities on the go. The app allows users to add text layers and &quot;easily create and share professional multilayered images and designs in minutes.&quot; Photoshop Fix, on the other hand, is more tailored towards light touch-ups and refinements.



Photoshop Mix was last updated three years ago, while Photoshop Fix was updated two years with support for the iPhone X and newer screen ratio. Both apps will remain available for download on the App Store until June 21.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve highlighted several new features coming in macOS Monterey, such as Low Power Mode and the option to erase a Mac without reinstalling the operating system, but there are some smaller tidbits that we wanted to share.





Animated Memoji on Login Screen


One small but fun new feature in macOS Monterey is the addition of a personalized Memoji on the login screen, complete with animated facial expressions.

Change the Color of the Mouse Pointer


A new Accessibility feature added to macOS Monterey is the ability to customize the outline and fill color of the mouse pointer so it&#x27;s easier to recognize when it moves or changes to an insertion point, crosshair, hand, or other shape. The pointer …</span>

                    <span>Apple has been working on an Apple Store at the iconic Tower Theatre in Los Angeles for years now, and the new location is set to open later this month on June 24.





Apple Tower Theatre is the first retail store in downtown Los Angeles, and it&#x27;s located in L.A.&#x27;s historic Broadway Theater District. This location was the city&#x27;s retail hub for the first half of the twentieth century, and is now home to a dozen theater locations.



From the beginning, Apple has envisioned the Tower Theatre store as one of the world&#x27;s most prominent Apple retail locations, and Apple has been overhauling the interior of the building to turn it into retail space and an active community area. Apple shared a rendering of what Tower Theatre might look like back in 2018.

                    <span>Apple this week released Boot Camp version 6.1.15 for users running Windows on a Mac, as noted in a Reddit post spotted by The Verge.





The update adds support for more precise trackpad gestures on MacBooks running Windows, including a single tap to click, tapping the lower-right corner to right-click, swiping down to scroll up, and various multi-touch gestures using three or four fingers.



Support for these precise trackpad gestures while running Windows is available on Macs with Apple&#x27;s T2 chip, according to an Apple user guide.



Boot Camp allows Windows to boot natively on Intel-based Macs. The utility is not available on Macs with the M1 chip.

                    <span>As part of WWDC this week, Apple revealed that newer Macs will be gaining support for Adaptive-Sync external displays with variable refresh rates in macOS Monterey.





Apple says Adaptive-Sync displays will be supported on any Mac with Apple silicon, like the M1 chip, as well as &quot;many&quot; recent Intel-based Macs. When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences &gt; Displays.



Adaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.



Macs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game&#x27;s frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.

                    <span>In iOS 15, Safari has been completely redesigned with easier-to-reach controls in mind. Foremost is a new, compact tab bar that floats at the bottom of the screen when you&#x27;re not inputting a URL address. Safari on iOS has also inherited the Start Page from macOS Big Sur, and you can now create tab groups to allow you to easily access them across devices. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at how it all fits together.





The Start Page


First seen in macOS Big Sur, Safari&#x27;s redesigned Start Page is where your Bookmarks, Favorites, Frequently Visited sites, Siri Suggestions, iCloud Tabs, Reading List, and Privacy Report all live. 





Like macOS, you can customize which of these items appear on your Start Page via the Edit button at the bottom, and you can also add a custom wallpaper…</span>

                    <span>In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, Apple is expanding the features built into the stock Reminders app, which received a major overhaul in 2019. With the new updates shipping this fall, users will be able to create &quot;Smart Lists&quot; that corral reminders based on different filters, such as their location, due date, flag, priority, and more.





With the new functionality, users can create powerful lists that show reminders based only on several filters. For example, users may create a Smart List with a filter to show reminders due on the weekend, with their location set to home. Apple offers five filters as of the current betas for the software, including date, time, location, flag, and priority.



For date, users can select to show reminders only due on a specific date, a relative range, a specified range, such as over the weekend or longer, and reminders due on any date. Users can select a filter for any time of day or more granular options for morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The location filter allows users to see only reminders due in a specific location. Users can also select the flag filter to show only flagged reminders and the priority filter.



‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and ‌macOS Monterey‌ are all currently in beta testing for members of the Apple Developer Program, with public beta versions set to be released soon.

                    <span>Apple has begun testing a major redesign to the iCloud Mail experience on the web, bringing its webmail service more in line with recent design changes made in macOS Big Sur.





The new design, currently in beta, reported first by 9to5mac, features a cleaner overall design and feel than the current public experience of ‌iCloud‌ Mail for the web. The current, soon-to-be previous version features thin typography, lighter colors, and design elements from iOS 7. Additionally, the new design allows users to compose emails in a smaller window in the middle of the screen, compared to opening an entirely new window.



As the new design is in beta testing alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS Monterey, and tvOS 15, it will likely be made available for all ‌iCloud‌ web users later this fall. Users wanting to try the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design can check out the beta website for iCloud.

                    <span>Nashville Chatter Class has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database pointing towards several unreleased iPhone 13 models that Apple will be launching in the fall.





Versions of iPhone running iOS 14 are listed with the model numbers A2628, A2630, A2634, A2635, A2640, A2643, and A2645. None of the numbers correspond to Apple&#x27;s existing smartphone lineup.



The EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia&#x27;s requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.



Apple&#x27;s 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end &quot;Pro&quot; models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.



Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. See our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.

                    <span>In iOS 15, Apple is introducing a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera&#x27;s viewfinder or in a photo you&#x27;ve taken and let you perform several actions with it. 





For example, Live Text allows you to capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call, or look up a location name in Maps to get directions. It also incorporates optical character recognition, so you can search for a picture of a handwritten note in your photos and save it as text. 



Live Text&#x27;s content awareness extends to everything from QR codes to emails that appear in pictures, and this on-device intelligence feeds into Siri suggestions, too.

                    <span>Facebook has announced new features for its Messenger app, including a quick reply bar, QR codes, and new chat themes.





The new quick reply bar can be found in the Messenger media viewer, and aims to make it easier to chat about media posted by friends without needing to go back to the main chat thread.



Users can tap on a photo or video and send a response via the quick reply bar, which lives at the bottom of the screen, then swipe up to exit the fullscreen media viewer to return to the main chat thread.





Three new chat themes, which are available in both Messenger and Instagram in chat settings, let users add new twists to their chat thread backgrounds. The themes include Olivia Rodrdigo, World Oceans Day, and F9: Fast and Furious.



In addition, Facebook is adding QR codes and payment links for use with Facebook Pay, allowing users to make payments even if they&#x27;re not on Facebook. 





To access a personal QR code and payment link, go to Messenger settings and tap &quot;Facebook Pay.&quot; Users can share the payment link or allow friends to scan the QR code to send or request money.



The new features are rolling out now to Facebook Messenger, which is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Home invasion thrillers are inherently terrifying for corrupting the private space designated most for comfort and safety. The terror compounds when the home dweller can’t fight back easily; their vulnerability exacerbates the suspense tenfold—vulnerabilities like blindness. See for Me isn’t the first home invasion thriller to center around a blind character trying to evade the dangerous men […]</span>

                    <span>Igor Bonifacic, writing for Engadget:
Apple told Engadget the feature will work with stereo, 5.1, 7.1
and Dolby Atmos content. Whether you’re using a pair of AirPods
Pro or AirPods Max, the software that powers the feature will
widen the soundstage so that it seems like the entire room you’re
in is being filled with sound. When you sit down to watch a movie
or TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after
it detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while.
Once you get up to walk around, it will reactivate. Connecting
your AirPods to an Apple TV is also easy in this context. When
you’re near the device with your headphones, it will display a
popup that will allow you to quickly connect, and you won’t need
to dig into the settings menu.

I met the people who were saying that metal objects now stuck to
them because of their vaccines and gave them a whole recruitment
speech about how they were the next stage in evolution, but once I
said the word “evolution,” they looked at me doubtfully. Then I
asked them to show off their abilities, and — I hate to say this
but, have you ever been at a friend’s amateur magic show, where
the magic show is not going quite as was hoped, and there’s a lot
of saying “hold on” and “wait, hang on” and “sorry” as they fail
several times running to identify your card, and then a dead bird
falls unprompted out of someone’s hat? Frankly, that would have
been an improvement.

                    <span>The New York Times:
As the Justice Department investigated who was behind leaks of
classified information early in the Trump administration, it took
a highly unusual step: Prosecutors subpoenaed Apple for data from
the accounts of at least two Democrats on the House Intelligence
Committee, aides and family members. One was a minor.
All told, the records of at least a dozen people tied to the
committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018, including those of
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, then the panel’s top
Democrat and now its chairman, according to committee officials
and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric
Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he
had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed. […]
Moreover, just as it did in investigating news organizations,
the Justice Department secured a gag order on Apple that expired
this year, according to a person familiar with the inquiry, so
lawmakers did not know they were being investigated until Apple
informed them last month.
Adam Schiff:
Trump repeatedly demanded the DOJ go after his political enemies.
It’s clear his demands didn’t fall on deaf ears.
This baseless investigation, while now closed, is yet another
example of Trump’s corrupt weaponization of justice.
And how much he imperiled our democracy.

Another Eklund to the Flyers?
 William Eklund is clearly head and shoulders above the other first round European prospects.
Playing in the SHL full time this past season (he played 20 SHL games in 2019-20), Eklund outpaced 2020 first round picks Alexander Holtz (who is also his teammate, and in fact, linemate) and Lucas Raymond, and delivered a solid postseason performance. Many consider Eklund to be the most skilled forward in terms of raw ability in the draft, and given my personal propensity to favor European prospects from men’s leagues, I would have to agree.

One team’s questionable player is another team’s gold?
 The Flyers are in a precarious position heading into the offseason. As a team in need of significant changes while working with limited cap space, producing trades, handling free agency, and running the expansion draft in a way that will regain the confidence of the less than magnanimous fanbase won’t be easy. The aforementioned salary squeeze will make adding multiple no-brainer plugs for the gaps on this roster nearly impossible, so Chucky Two-Trades would be wise to pursue players that are underrated by the rest of the league. Whether that be to simply restructure the team’s salary or to provide cheap depth that’ll free up room to add a star is up to him.
With that in mind, below are som…</span>

How the 21-year-old forward rose above expectations in a year of disappointments for the Flyers.
 After spending most of his draft plus two season playing in the NHL during the 2019-20 campaign, Joel Farabee broke out in a big way offensively for the Flyers in his 2021 sophomore campaign. To put it simply, Farabee was one of the best goal scorers in the NHL this season, and he just turned 21 at the end of February. 
Farabee led the Flyers in goal-scoring with 20, tying him for 30th league wide, equal to players like Nathan MacKinnon and David Pastrnak. Even more impressive is that 16 of those goals occurred at even strength, tying him for 6th in the league with Alex DeBrincat, Brad Marchand, Kirill Kaprizov, and Kyle Connor. On a per minute basis, Fa…</span>

The sport is only two weeks old, but it already has hustlers and sandbaggers
 Barely two weeks into its launch and Knockout City already has hustlers.
Karthik Bala, co-founder of the studio that developed the multiplayer shooter-like dodgeball title for Electronic Arts, said he’s run into them himself. “They were messing with me,” he laughed. “They come in, they look like one of the default [skins] on startup, they play poorly, they’re uncoordinated as a team, they’re purposefully not on a crew together.”
After stumbling to a 7-to-1 deficit early in Team KO, then they poured it on. “I’m like, ‘I’ve got this game lit,’” Bala chortled. “And then all of a sudden it just flipped; and they do the ‘woo-hoo!’ and the taunts. And I’m like, what just ha…</span>

Halo, Starfield, Fable, and Game Pass news
 Microsoft’s E3 2021 press conference — called the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase — has a lot of ground to cover on June 13. The company has more to reveal for long-delayed Halo Infinite, including hopefully a finalized release date. It will also likely have updates to the Fable and Forza franchises, and Rare will likely have updates to Sea of Thieves and hopefully more to say on its mystical title Everwild. 
The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase will stream on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and last for about 90 minutes. 
This is the first E3 since Microsoft acquired Bethesda, so the publisher and its studios will also take part in the press conference. Expect updates on long-awaited Starfield, and maybe a better look at The Elder Scrolls 6. Bethesda also promised updates to Fallout 76. 
Ahead of E3, Microsoft revealed plans to bring Xbox Game Pass and streaming games to internet-capable TVs and other stand-alone platforms, as well as bringing cloud based gaming to iOS devices. Microsoft also committed to bring at least one new first-party Xbox Game Studios game to Game Pass every quarter.</span>

Elden Ring leads the list at 2021’s latest-and-greatest showcase
 E3 2021 means game trailers and video highlights by the dozen. By the score. By the gross. We’ll do our best to catalogue here all of the reveals and demonstrations coming from a week of presentations and keynotes.
We already got a slew of new looks at big games during the two-hour Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live on Thursday. That will be followed by major publishers Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Bethesda and Microsoft over the weekend. Nintendo’s highly anticipated E3 2021 Nintendo Direct on Tuesday caps the big week.
Here are all the game trailers for E3 2021; check back frequently, this list will be updated.</span>

Kena blends multiple genres into something new
 Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the first game from new studio Ember Lab. Its first trailer made it look like a cute romp through a forest overtaken by darkness, but after spending over an hour with a hands-on demo of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, I’ve learned it’s surprisingly difficult. Kena may look like the latest from Pixar, but the final mini-boss I encountered kicked my ass up, down, and sideways.
Kena: Bridge of Spirits has layers to it — some cute, others tough — and it made for a fun preview full of surprises.
What is Kena: Bridge of Spirits?

This week you can pick up three weapons and an armor piece
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week.
Map: The Burnout
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock)
Flawless — Igneous Hammer (Adept), Solar hand cannon
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. 
Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, hanging out by the back stairs in the Hangar.

Ceramics will have their revenge
 FromSoftware’s Elden Ring finally came out of hiding on Thursday, after two years of deafening silence about the new adventure from Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin. It looked spectacular, in a next-gen Dark Souls kind of way, with its gigantic lightning-chucking dragons, double-jumping horses, a spider made of fingers, a brand-new Tall Lady to obsess over, and, of course, those pots.
Oh, those pots.
Elden Ring’s first gameplay trailer barely hinted at the existence of anthropomorphic pots, but they’ve becoming a quiet sensation since they were revealed. It seems everyone — there are dozens of us! — loves the little pot with arms and legs, and the slightly larger pot with arms and legs. In case you blacked …</span>

Security breach was reportedly performed via EA’s Slack
 A group of hackers has said they’ve broken into The Sims 4 and FIFA publisher Electronic Arts’ internal systems, according to a report from Vice. Hackers reportedly stole FIFA 21 source code — for the game and its matchmaking components — as well as source code for EA’s Frostbite engine.
A total of 780 GB of data stolen was stolen, Vice reported, including “proprietary EA frameworks and software development kits.” Hackers provided Vice with documents reportedly stolen in the hack, with information on PlayStation VR and other development tools.
“We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,” an EA representative told Vice. “No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident, we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation.”
Hackers reportedly accessed EA’s internal systems through workplace chat platform Slack, which plenty of companies use for online communication. The hackers told Vice they obtained access to an EA Slack channel using “stolen cookies” sold online for $10. (Cookies can be used to access login details.)
The hackers said they contacted an EA IT support person via Slack for a “multifactor authentication token” — claiming they’d lost their phone — to login to EA’s network. The hackers provided Vice with screenshots of the steps taken in accessing the information; Vice later confirmed the details of the hack with EA.
Contents of the hack have not been released online, at least just yet. Vice reported that the hackers are looking to sell the data.
EA has not responded to Polygon’s request for more information.</span>

Koch Media unveils new publishing label
 The next Payday game from Starbreeze Studios and a brand-new Painkiller are coming from a newly announced game publishing label called Prime Matter. Koch Media, which also owns publishing labels Deep Silver, Milestone, and Ravenscourt, announced Prime Matter on Thursday, revealing its first slate of games.
Koch Media calls Prime Matter a “premium label” that’s “dedicated to delivering brilliant immersive games.” That includes soon-to-be-released titles like Encased from Dark Crystal Games and King’s Bounty 2 by 1C Entertainment, both of which are due in the coming months. Then there are games that won’t be out for years, including Payday 3 and a new Painkiller game from Saber Interactive. 
In between, Prime Matter will publish Crossfire: Legion, a new real-time strategy game from Blackbird Interactive based on Smilegate’s Crossfire shooter series; GunGrave GORE, developer Iggymob’s anime-inspired third-person action shooter; and Kingdom Come Deliverance for Nintendo Switch. 
Prime Matter will also publish dark sci-fi action adventure Scars Above, futuristic FPS Codename Final Form, Lovecraftian horror action RPG Dolmen, Middle Ages-era action RPG The Last Oricru, story-driven fantasy adventure Echoes Of The End, and psychedelic horror adventure The Chant.
For a peek at many of those games, check out Prime Matter’s sizzle reel below.</span>

                    <span>At TED2020, Ethan Hawke gave a remote talk about the benefits of being creative. As someone who often struggles to find meaning in whatever it is I do here, this bit was especially good to hear:
Do you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and, “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?”
Or the inverse — something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” And that’s when art’s not a luxury, it’s actually sustenance. We need it.

                    <span>For many of us in the US and other parts of the world, with Covid-19 on the decline because of vaccinations, the last month or two has seen people getting back into the world for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020. XKCD’s Randall Munroe plotted out some of these experiences on a scale from “normal” to “alarming”:

                    <span>Ever since I learned about bonsai trees as a kid, I’ve been fascinated with them. In my 20s, my girlfriend bought me a juniper bonsai for my birthday. I was really excited to see what I could do with it, but it was dead in a month and a half, forever dimming my enthusiasm for ever practicing bonsai myself. But I still love observing the process and seeing the results, so I’ve enjoyed watching Bucky Barnes’1 Bonsai Releaf videos. His latest video (above) documents the year-long transformation of a Japanese larch tree he purchased for £30 into something that looks like it’s been majestically clinging to a windswept cliff for hundreds of years.
Observation, healing, experimentation, growth, making irreversible choices — so many lovely little themes, lessons, and moments in this video. At one point, well into the process, he clips off most of a long branch and I exclaimed “Oh my God!” out loud. I guess I still need to work on letting go of attachments.

No, not that one.↩

                    <span>To the casual basketball fan, Nikola Jokic seems like an unlikely pick for NBA MVP. Outwardly, his game resembles middle-aged-guy-at-the-rec-center — “god-tier old man game” is how Gene Demby put it — but this video makes a good case that Jokic is “revolutionizing the center position”, “the best offensive passing big man ever”, and possibly even “the best offensive center in NBA history”.

                    <span>Apple is developing a new passkey feature that will allow customers to use Face ID and Touch ID-based account authentication in lieu of a password, Apple engineer Garrett Davidson explained today in a WWDC developer session (via CNET).





&quot;Passkeys in iCloud Keychain,&quot; a feature in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, stores a new WebAuthn credential called a passkey in ‌iCloud‌ keychain. It&#x27;s used instead of a password for account creation and login, with one-tap login.



When you create an account using a passkey, there is no password to deal with. You can access that account with just a login and authentication through Touch ID or Face ID.



No password is required because your Apple device handles the generation and storage of the unique passkey used for the site, so login is j…</span>

                    <span>Former BMW senior executive and self-driving vehicle startup founder Ulrich Kranz has taken on a role at Apple working on the company&#x27;s autonomous car project, reports Bloomberg.





Kranz founded Canoo, a self-driving car startup that he left earlier this year. Prior to creating Canoo, Kranz helped to develop the i3 and i8 vehicles at BMW, where he was employed for 30 years.



According to Bloomberg, Kranz&#x27;s hiring is a sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving vehicle that will rival Tesla. Kranz will report to Apple Car lead Doug Fields, who works under AI chief John Giannandrea.



Rumors about Apple&#x27;s car project have picked up in recent months as Apple now appears to be looking for suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop the vehicle. There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai&#x27;s Kia division, but it&#x27;s not clear if that relationship has progressed.



Development on the ‌Apple Car‌ remains in the early stages, and Bloomberg suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.

                    <span>Tracking when you&#x27;ve opened up an email and what you&#x27;ve read is something that many companies and advertisers rely on for their marketing efforts, plus there are email clients out there designed to let users know when the emails they&#x27;ve sent have been opened up.





Much of this tracking is facilitated by remote images that load when viewing an email, and some of it is even sneakier, with advertisers using invisible tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are hidden graphics that you might not see in an email, but your email client loads them, allowing senders to gather data from you. Senders can see that you&#x27;ve opened an email get other information, such as your IP address.

                    <span>Microsoft has announced that following beta testing for a small group of users, it plans to launch its xCloud game streaming service on Apple devices via Safari &quot;in the next few weeks.&quot;





Microsoft has been attempting to launch its game streaming service, which allows users to stream games from the cloud rather than store them locally on the device, on Apple&#x27;s platforms for some time. Microsoft and Apple got into a heated public argument last year over App Store guidelines that rejected apps such as xCloud from being available on the ‌App Store‌. Apple eventually changed the policy, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. 



Microsoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on iPhone and iPad. Alongside xCloud on Safari, the streaming service will also launch on Edge and Chrome.

                    <span>One small but useful new feature introduced in iOS 15 is the ability for customers to request refunds for in-app purchases directly within an app, rather than having to use the Report a Problem page on Apple&#x27;s website.





Apple has introduced a new StoreKit API that allows developers to implement a &quot;Request a Refund&quot; option within their apps. Users can tap on this option, select a specific in-app purchase, identify the issue that prompted the refund request, and tap the Request Refund button. Once the request is submitted, customers will receive an email from Apple with an update on the status of their refund within 48 hours.



When requesting a refund within an app, customers still have the option to visit the Report a Problem page on Apple&#x27;s website to check the status of claims.



‌iOS 15‌ is available now in beta for developers, and will be publicly released in the fall.

                    <span>On iOS and iPadOS 15, Apple is adding new functionality to WidgetKit, introduced last year, that will allow developers to classify information deemed as sensitive in their widgets, meaning that specific information will only become viewable on the lock screen when the user unlocks their device.





iOS 14 introduced completely redesigned ‌widgets‌ for the lock screen and Home Screen. While there are no major changes to WidgetKit this year, the new password-protected feature may be welcomed by apps that feature ‌widgets‌ with sensitive information, such as health and banking information. Widgets are accessible on the lock screen by swiping left to Today View.



Related to ‌widgets‌ on iOS 15 is new functionality for Smart Stacks. Smart Stacks allows users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to be shown depending on factors such as time of day, location, and more. 



On ‌iOS 15‌, the system can now automatically add widgets to Smart Stacks that it believes are relevant. The feature called Widget Suggestions is a new way for users to discover ‌widgets‌ they may not have known existed. Developers interested in learning more about the changes in ‌iOS 15‌ can check out this WWDC session.

                    <span>Last year, Apple acquired the weather app Dark Sky, and shortly after its purchase, Apple shut down the app for Android. Despite the revamped iOS 15 Weather app taking heavy inspiration from Dark Sky, the weather&#x27;s app standalone iOS app, web app, and API will remain available until the end of next year, compared to the end of this year, as previously planned.





Dark Sky announced in an update to its blog that &quot;support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022,&quot; and that the iOS and web app will also remain available until the end of next year. Dark Sky had originally planned to shut down its web app alongside the closure of its Android application; however, that was delayed indefinitely.



A number of popular third-party iOS weather apps have relied on the Dark Sky API over the years, and those apps will be able to continue functioning through next year without needing to migrate to a new provider.



The revamped Weather app on iOS 15 includes several features in which Apple is taking clear inspiration and value from its Dark Sky purchase. Alongside a fresh new design, ‌iOS 15‌ includes live weather notifications, graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and more.

                    <span>As part of WWDC this week, Apple introduced a new MailKit framework for macOS Monterey that enables developers to create Mail app extensions that block content, perform message and composing actions, and help with security.





There will be four main categories of Mail app extensions, according to Apple:
Compose: Extensions that provide new workflows when composing emails


Actions: Extensions that apply custom rules to incoming emails, such as an email being color coded, moved to a separate inbox, marked as read, or flagged


Content Blocking: Extensions that serve as WebKit content blockers for emails based on specific criteria in an email&#x27;s HTML code


Message Security: Extensions that sign, encrypt, and decrypt emails when sending and receiving mail, with signed and encrypted icons below emails
Xcode 13, available in beta, includes a template for developers looking to create Mail app extensions on the Mac. The extensions can be built into existing Mac apps and can also be distributed through the Mac App Store, according to a WWDC session about MailKit, which is available on macOS only and not iOS or iPadOS.



In the WWDC session, Apple indicated that older Mail app plug-ins will stop functioning in an unspecified future macOS release.



macOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July.

                    <span>The next time you try talking on a FaceTime call on iOS 15 with your microphone muted, iOS will provide you a subtle reminder to unmute your microphone so others can hear you.





The new reminder, first spotted by The Verge, is part of a wider assortment of changes and new features coming to ‌FaceTime‌ with the release of ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this fall. Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.



Apple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, including those on Android and Windows, brand-new SharePlay functionality, and more.

                    <span>Apple says that starting at a future date, it will offer members of the Apple Developer Program access to beta versions of AirPods Pro firmware updates before they&#x27;re released and shipped to the public.





Apple made the announcement for developers on the downloads page where beta versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS are available. According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. 

Pre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date. This will allow development of features on iOS and macOS for AirPods as well as enable new features, including Conversation Boost (beam forming) and Ambient Noise Reduction (noise suppressor).
Currently, Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, and AirPods Max, although there&#x27;s no reliable way to manually update the devices. Instead, they&#x27;re updated automatically when connected to power and nearby a paired iPhone or iPad with an internet connection. 



It remains unclear how Apple will provide beta versions for ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware. Presumably, Apple will provide a profile for developers to download that automatically installs and updates the ‌AirPods Pro‌ when there&#x27;s a new update.

                    <span>Apple is looking to add Fitness+ Audio Meditations to the Mindfulness Apple Watch app, according to a now-removed image from WWDC.







Apple&#x27;s Platforms State of the Union video featured a brief image of a collection of devices running the company&#x27;s various new operating systems, and the Apple Watch in that image showed the Mindfulness app with a Fitness+ Audio Meditations feature.



Apple has now attempted to hide its plans for Fitness+ Audio Meditations by uploading a wholly new Platforms State of the Union video that removes the implicating image, replacing it with a generic image of the Mindfulness app. MacRumors was able to verify that Apple revealed the feature in the original video.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today launched a promotion in Canada that offers a $75 Apple Store gift card with the purchase of a new iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini through June 28. The offer does not apply to the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max.





The offer is valid in Canada at physical Apple Store locations, through Apple&#x27;s online store, in the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE for iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini purchases made between June 10 and June 28. Purchases made with carrier financing are eligible, with full terms and conditions outlined on Apple&#x27;s website.



Apple&#x27;s online store went down earlier today in Canada, likely in relation to this promotion launching. The offer does not appear to be available in the United States or other countries at this time, nor does it apply to any other products.



Apple released the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in October 2020, and introduced a purple color option for the devices in late April.

                    <span>With iOS 15, AirPods Pro and AirPods Max will be able to tap into the Find My network, allowing users to locate their lost AirPods in the unfortunate event they get lost outside of nearby Bluetooth range.





Users have always been able to locate their ‌AirPods‌ through the ‌Find My‌ app within Bluetooth range. Now, with ‌iOS 15‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ can tap into the ‌Find My‌ network to relay their approximate location, even if they&#x27;re out of Bluetooth range from the owner. ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will still need to be within close proximity to a ‌Find My‌ device, such as an iPhone, however. 



‌Find My‌ allows devices to crowdsource the location of other ‌Find My‌ devices, meaning even if they&#x27;re relatively far away, ‌Find My‌ should be able to provide an approximate location.

Use the ‌Find My‌ network to get an approximate location of your missing ‌AirPods Pro‌ or ‌AirPods Max‌. This will help you get within Bluetooth range so you can play a sound and locate them.
Beats headphones, also owned by Apple, added support for ‌Find My‌ earlier this year. ‌Find My‌ also gained other new features in ‌iOS 15‌, including brand new separation alerts that notify users if a ‌Find My‌ compatible device is left behind, a brand new Find My widget for the Home Screen, and the ability for ‌Find My‌ to locate an ‌iPhone‌ even if its low on battery, or completely turned off.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/biden-order-revokes-trump-tiktok-ban/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn a series of executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat in the United States.





Trump signed several executive orders banning apps tied to China during his time in office. In the most high profile order, Trump sought a ban of the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm Bytedance, in 2020.



However, Trump&#x27;s bans were never enforced after several court orders blocked the restrictions, despite claims by the Trump administration that the apps posed a risk to national security. 



Biden&#x27;s new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders that Trump issued in August, which attempted to force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. company, along with another one that Trump signed in January which targeted several other messaging and financial transaction apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay.



Going forward, the Biden administration says it will instead take an &quot;evidence-based approach&quot; when reviewing the security concerns posed by apps. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be tasked with the job of reviewing apps developed by those &quot;in the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.&quot;



A separate US national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active, and an administration official has said that the White House remains &quot;very concerned&quot; about the data risks of TikTok users.



Biden&#x27;s order says collecting of data from Americans &quot;threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,&quot; and directs the Commerce Department to continually evaluate any transactions that &quot;pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States.&quot;

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/unreleased-ipod-touch-5-chamfered-edges/">

                    <span>Occasional leaker Mr White has today shared interesting images on Twitter of what appears to be an old-school fifth-generation iPod touch prototype with chamfered edges and a brushed aluminum finish. 





The original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 that Apple released in October 2012 had a unibody anodized aluminum chassis with rounded edges, and was available in several colors, including slate. 





Another interesting detail on the prototype, which lacks an Apple logo on the back, is the presence of a 30-pin dock connector, suggesting it was designed before Apple formally adopted Lightning. 



Along with the iPhone 5, iPod nano (7th generation), and iPad (4th generation), the original ‌iPod touch‌ 5 was one of the first Apple devices to feature a Lightning port. 





The prototype also has the headphone jack bottom-right, whereas on the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 it was located on the left. Apple discontinued the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 in 2015.



We haven&#x27;t heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‌iPod touch‌ in the works. The current seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple&#x27;s iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017.

                    <span>Linus Torvalds, on the Linux Kernel mailing list:
Please keep your insane and technically incorrect anti-vax comments to yourself.
You don’t know what you are talking about, you don’t know what mRNA
is, and you’re spreading idiotic lies. Maybe you do so unwittingly,
because of bad education. Maybe you do so because you’ve talked to
“experts” or watched youtube videos by charlatans that don’t know what
they are talking about.
But dammit, regardless of where you have gotten your mis-information
from, any Linux kernel discussion list isn’t going to have your
idiotic drivel pass uncontested from me.
A shrinking violet, as ever.

                    <span>Holy hell this new project from Zane, a mononymous developer who just dropped this out of the blue yesterday. It’s available via TestFlight (the first one is full already, though) and as open source code you can build yourself.
It’s exquisitely well done, very fun to play with, and surprisingly usable. And what a remarkable testimony to the expressiveness of Swift UI.

                    <span>Screen Times:
At the end of last week we detailed an update to the HBO Max Apple
TV app that introduced a whole host of issues, making the app
almost unusable. Check out our article for the very long
list. The issues were so bad that HBO exec Andy Forssell even
addressed them in a reply to John Siracusa on Twitter.
Thankfully, HBO has now issued a software update that reverts the
playback UI to the original tvOS version. I’ve verified this in
the 50.30.2 update and can confirm everything is back to normal
from skipping ahead to asking Siri ‘What did they say?’ and
everything in between.
You make a mistake, you fix it as fast as you can. Kudos, HBO Max tvOS team. 
Someone should send this to the new team behind the MLB app.

                    <span>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:
On the macOS Monterey features page, fine print indicates
that the following features require a Mac with the M1 chip,
including any MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac
model released since November 2020:
Portrait Mode blurred backgrounds in FaceTime videos
Live Text for copying and pasting, looking up, or translating
text within photos
An interactive 3D globe of Earth in the Maps app
More detailed maps in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles,
New York, and London in the Maps app
Text-to-speech in more languages, including Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian, and Finnish
On-device keyboard dictation that performs all processing
completely offline
Unlimited keyboard dictation (previously limited to 60 seconds
per instance)
Apple has not explained why any of these features are not
available on Intel-based Macs. For what it’s worth, Google Earth
has long offered an interactive 3D globe of the Earth on
Intel-based Macs both on the web and in an app.
I don’t think Apple has to explain. These features all clearly are built on code that uses features exclusive to Apple Silicon. E.g. for Portrait Mode in FaceTime, it uses the M1 imaging pipeline — the same thing that makes all FaceTime footage on the M1 MacBooks look so much better than on any Intel MacBook, even though the camera hardware is the same. The speech/dictation features on this list are surely using the Neural Engine, something Intel Macs don’t even have.

                    <span>Good overview of one of this week’s biggest announcements from Dave Hamilton for The Mac Observer:
Apple’s iCloud Private Relay works similar to a VPN in that it
routes your traffic through other servers, hiding your IP address
from the websites you visit, and hiding your traffic from whomever
manages your local network. Where it differs is that a VPN is
generally just one server between you and the website you’re
visiting. With a VPN, your traffic takes the route of You ↔︎ VPN
Server ↔︎ Website. Private Relay adds another server to the
mix, which ensures that no one in the chain — not even Apple — can see the whole picture: You ↔︎ Apple’s Ingress Server ↔︎
Content Provider’s Egress Server ↔︎ Website.
This is, as Apple calls it in their “Get Ready for iCloud Private
Relay” WWDC Session on the topic, “Privacy by Design.”
Apple made specific mention that while the “Ingress Proxy” servers
are run by Apple, the “Egress Proxy” (aka the server which
communicates with the websites you visit) is not controlled by
Apple and is under the control of “a (trusted) content provider”.
This means that Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting,
and the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.
I’m using this on both an iPhone and iPad running the new OS betas, and it doesn’t seem to slow anything down. I did run into a problem where initially, both devices were saying I needed to upgrade to a paid iCloud account to enable the feature in Safari (also for Mail’s new tracker privacy protection), even though I’ve got an Apple One family account. I “fixed” that by restarting both devices after poking around the iCloud section in Settings. Not a bad bug for a developer beta 1 — just figured I’d mention it here in case anyone else runs into it.

5.1.1(v): Apps supporting account creation must also offer account deletion.
I don’t see how anyone could disagree that this is a good rule. There’s a lot to complain about in the App Store Guidelines but there’s also a lot that’s unambiguously pro-user.

                    <span>Alex Heath, for The Verge:
Facebook is taking a novel approach to its first smartwatch, which the company hasn’t confirmed publicly but currently plans to debut next summer. The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, The Verge has learned.
A camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission.
Sounds right. A tiny concealable camera to take surreptitious photos that upload to Facebook sounds exactly like something Mark Zuckerberg came up with himself.

A winger, at long last!
 As the draft board rolls on, we’ve finally got our first winger entering the mix, would you look at that!
It was something of a strange season for Guenther, in truth—because of COVID restrictions and the WHL starting their season late, he didn’t really play a whole lot. He started with Sherwood Park of the AJHL on a loan, got in four games with them before returning to Edmonton, and then played 12 games with them. It wasn’t a whole lot of playing time to work with, but Guenther sure made the most of it, cruising with a cool 2 points per game pace in the WHL, and that’s a performance that’s certainly turned a number of heads.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Kevin Hayes spoke about his injury and why he looked a little... crappy this season. [Inquirer]
*We talked about Bruce Cassidy getting a hefty fine for talking about the refs in the Isles-Bruins series, but it seems to have worked. Maybe more coaches should complain? [NESN]
*But again, here we are talking about the referees. As we have been all playoffs, and not for good reason. It’s not a good look. [AP]
*So can the refs be pushed to make calls? Should the really just call the rulebook as written? It’s all very annoying. [Sportsnet]
*Speaking of complaining about the refs, Mark Scheifele is complaining about his suspension. [TSN]
*We got the Norris nominees yesterday. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Jack Eichel is almost surely going to be gone from Buffalo, which sucks for them. [Die By The Blade]
*If the Avalanche are going to get back into things tonight they’re going to have to figure out Mark Stone. [The Athletic]
*Like those Knights, the Kraken are probably going to be very popular out of the gate. [The Hockey News]
*We’re on to the third overall pick in our community draft. [BSH]
*And finally, P.K. Subban seems to be coming in to his final form. He’ll be very good at this. [The Hockey News]
NEWS: P.K. Subban to ESPN as an NHL analyst, according to a source. He will debut tonight on SportsCenter tonight.

Fight Deadites with three friends (and one frenemy)
 On Thursday at the Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at the gameplay of Evil Dead: The Game, an upcoming co-op shooter. Four players choose their characters from the cast of the Evil Dead franchise, and then move as a team through towns, woods, and creepy cabins. A breach between worlds has opened, summoning monsters to deal with.
One player gets to take on the role of the antagonist, a Kandarian Demon; they’re tasked with hunting down everyone else in the game. The demon can possess the good guys, manipulate the environment, and fly. It’ll be a constant concern throughout a match, especially if it’s controlled by a skilled player.
While moving through the environment, players have the opportunity to loot and craft. It’ll also be necessary to actively manage your player character’s fear. If they get too scared, they can actually die, which is pretty alarming in and of itself. Once players find the necessary items, like pages of the Necronomicon, they can turn the tables on the Kandarian Demon. It looks a little like Dead by Daylight, if the survivors had the ability to fight back.
Evil Dead: The Game will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

The trailer shows a tragic backdrop to a tranquil scene
 Planet of Lana is a beautiful new cinematic puzzle adventure game from the Swedish indie studio, Wishfully. It was announced during Summer Games Fest kick-off event on Thursday.
The story follows Lana, and her animal companion as they embark on a mission to save Lana’s sister. Their planet — which used to be a place in perfect harmony between human, nature — has fallen into chaos and now must endure a faceless army.
What’s interesting though, is that this game expressly isn’t about war or conflict. “This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet –and the journey to keep it that way,” a description from the developers said. 
The world in Planet of Lana looks stunning. From what we saw in the trailer, the game boasts stunning hand-painted graphics and a Miyazaki-esque world. 
A release shared that the visual style “combines hand-drawn artwork, complex parallax layering and subtle use of 3D graphics to give the look of an interactive painting.” The game will run on high-end PCs and the Xbox Series X with a native resolution of 4K at 60 frames per second, “allowing its incredible artwork to come to life.”
In the trailer, we see a young woman, Lana, embrace a cute and chirpy black creature. The opening scene is tranquil. There’s a large moon in the background, a gentle breeze blowing the tall grass, and you can hear birds in the background. 
However, as the camera zooms out we see what looks to be dozens of rockets fast approaching the planet. It’s a grim, but captivating juxtaposition that introduces us to its new world. 
Planet of Lana is slated to come out in 2022 to PC Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in late 2022.</span>

FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited game arrives in 2022
 Elden Ring, the long-awaited new game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware, has finally come out of hiding. Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream.
The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC.
Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses!
Check out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.


The last time we heard anything about Elden Ring was in June 2019, when Bandai Namco and FromSoftware officially revealed the game. Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.
Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.”
FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.
Elden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next year.</span>

Less Masquerade, more mass murdering
 Developer Sharkmob is creating a new game in the Vampire: the Masquerade universe, but it’s a far cry from the dialogue-heavy RPGs that are common to the franchise. Instead, this is an action-packed battle royale game with swords, shotguns, and sniper rifles. At the Summer Game Fest on Thursday, Sharkmob showed off the game in more detail. The title was originally teased in fall 2020, but it finally has a name: Bloodhunt.
We saw some in-engine alpha footage of urban environments, including graveyards and nightclubs. The trailer also showed vampires from different clans, like Brujah and Nosferatu vampires in the street. Players will get to pick their clan, which will determine their playstyle. It also looks as though civilians factor into this game in a significant way, and vampires may be able to feed on them for a little boost. 
There’s an array of ways to go about, well, the battle in this battle royale. Some characters rely on weapons and explosives, while others augment their gunplay with powerful supernatural abilities like blinking through space or putting up blinding shields of light.
Bloodhunt is set to be released on PC in 2021. Players can sign up for a closed alpha test on the game’s official website.</span>

‘We cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with’
 CD Projekt, the parent company of the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, announced Thursday that the data breach it suffered earlier this year is potentially more damaging than originally thought. The news was announced during the high-profile industry premieres showcased during the Summer Game Fest, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
In early February CD Project announced that it was targeted by a “cyber attack” and that data, including video game source code, had been stolen. At the time, the Polish company said that “certain data” was being ransomed by unknown parties. It did not confirm the type of data stolen.

The Frontier Developments game will come out in 2021
 At Summer Game Fest on Thursday, actor Jeff Goldblum announced Frontier’s newest game, Jurassic World Evolution 2. The new title is the follow-up to the park-building sim released in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution, and it is slated to be released in 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Windows PC, and Xbox One. 
Goldblum had the honor of announcing the release, since he will play Dr. Ian Malcolm in the upcoming game, and has played Dr. Malcolm in the Jurassic Park film canon, and in games like The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. He will be joined by the actress Bryce Dallas Howard who will play Claire Dearing in the game.

An AI ‘Driver’ similar to L4D’s Director will make or break Chet Faliszek’s newest game
 Chet Faliszek won’t begrudge you for thinking his newest game sounds a lot like one of his old ones. The Anacrusis, coming this fall to Windows PC via Steam, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Xbox Game Pass, is a cooperative shooter in which four players must fight together against a relentless horde of mindless monsters. 
So, that’s basically Left 4 Dead, right?

Plus, two new roles: the Sherriff and the Scientist
 Among Us’ next update got partially revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream on Thursday, and it includes a new map, new colors and cosmetics, new roles, and a Hide and Seek mode. There’s no release date for this new content yet, and the only part of the map we got to see was one tiny environmental asset.
The new roles are the Sherriff and the Scientist. In the genre of hidden role games like Among Us, these roles are often used to give the civilians more power against hidden monsters. The Sherriff may be able to take an Impostor out without gaining consensus, and a Scientist may be able to test blood types. We’ll have to see how these new roles fit into the current crewmate/impostor dynamic.
There are also some other nice touches incoming: new visor cosmetics, new crewmate colors, and achievements.
Among Us was released in 2018, but the game saw a massive boost in popularity during the summer of 2020. The social deception game pits crewmates against disguised impostors. If the impostors manage to covertly kill all of the crewmates, they win, but if the crewmates can ferret out the impostors, then they win. It’s a simple concept that plays out very well, especially on streams. The game has maintained a steady fandom since 2020, and it’s still solidly part of the pop culture zeitgeist.</span>

The popular game remains in an extended beta period
 Battlestate Games, the developer behind the hardcore survival shooter Escape From Tarkov, is teasing a new map called Streets of Tarkov. A new residential section was shown Thursday during the Summer Game Fest hosted by Geoff Keighley. The trailer also introduced a fully functional armored personnel carrier.
Tarkov is a session-based game first announced in 2016. In it, players take on the role of private military contractors trapped in an isolated Eastern European war zone. Caught in between are the scavs, a lightly armed group of civilians fighting for survival. Tarkov is unique for a number of reasons, including its sophisticated ballistics model and its high-stakes, winner-takes-all looting mechanics…</span>

The new trailer also teases another update for Verdansk
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are getting another new season, but there won’t be a whole new map this time. We got a preview of the season’s changes during the Summer Games Fest event on Thursday, where Treyarch unveiled a new trailer for the update.
The largest Warzone-exclusive change seems to be the new updates coming to the time-warped Verdansk. It seems that a satellite has crashed onto the map, destroyed several buildings and leaving its wreckage strewn across the map. 
Meanwhile, on the Black Ops Cold War side of things, we got a glimpse of several new maps including Collateral, the 2v2 Amsterdam, and Hijacked, a remake of a Black Ops 3 map. The trailer also gave a few hints at what’s next for the Zombies mode. It seems there are a few new huge enemies on the way including something that looked like a dragon, and a new flaming train. One thing that wasn’t clear is which of these updates will arrive for Outbreak and which will be a new round-based map. 
Call of Duty: Warzone’s previous season involved a massive map change and a midseason patch that included an action movie event starring John McClane and John Rambo. While this patch certainly seems to be smaller than that, it does seem like it will have plenty of new additions to the game for players to check out over the next few months. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone season 4 will start on June 17.</span>

                    <span>This chart caught my eye yesterday:

It’s from Robin Dunbar’s recent book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our Most Important Relationships. You might recall the author’s name from his concept of Dunbar’s number:1 that on average people can maintain about 150 friendships with others, a limit that is determined by human brain size and function. The chart is a more detailed version of the concept: it shows, roughly, the number of people we can have meaningful relationships with at various levels of intimacy. Dunbar explains in this Atlantic interview:
The innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your romantic relationships. The next layer of five is your shoulders-to-cry-on friendships. They are the ones who will drop everything to support us when our wo…</span>

                    <span>Ed Yong writing in The Atlantic, Individualism Is Still Sabotaging the Pandemic Response:
From its founding, the United States has cultivated a national mythos around the capacity of individuals to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, ostensibly by their own merits. This particular strain of individualism, which valorizes independence and prizes personal freedom, transcends administrations. It has also repeatedly hamstrung America’s pandemic response. It explains why the U.S. focused so intensely on preserving its hospital capacity instead of on measures that would have saved people from even needing a hospital. It explains why so many Americans refused to act for the collective good, whether by masking up or isolating themselves. And it explains why the CDC, despite being the nation’s top public-health agency, issued guidelines that focused on the freedoms that vaccinated people might enjoy. The move signaled to people with the newfound privilege of immunity that they were liberated from the pandemic’s collective problem. It also hinted to those who were still vulnerable that their challenges are now theirs alone and, worse still, that their lingering risk was somehow their fault. (“If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands,” Walensky said.)


The pandemic demonstrated, in plain and easily understandable numbers of Covid deaths, that America is a place where the swift leave the stragglers to the wolves. I hope against hope that’ll change for the better in the future.

                    <span>Gymnast Simone Biles won her 7th US Gymnastics Championship this past weekend, further cementing her status as the world’s best gymnast and one of the most dominant athletes of all time in any sport. In her floor exercise routine on the first day of the competition, Biles absolutely nailed a triple double — that’s three twists while doing two backflips. Timothy Burke took the footage and slowed it down so that we can see exactly what’s going on in the air. And, Jesus, I was NOT prepared for what I saw. The two handsprings that set up the final move are beautiful slowed down, leisurely even. But then Biles launches herself impossibly high into the air — like absurdly and spectacularly high — and starts twisting and flipping at a speed that seems fast even for slow motion. And the landing — it’s like she was standing there all along, waiting for the rest of her spirit to join her. Watching the routine at regular speed makes you appreciate the move even more.
In reaction to this move, NBA head coach Stan Van Gundy, who has seen his fair share of elite athletes doing amazing things over the years, exclaimed: “How is that even humanly possible?” As if to preemptively answer him and everyone else watching, the sparkly leotard that Biles wore during her routine had a picture of a goat sown into it because she is the GOAT.

                    <span>I enjoy doing these quick hits on CNBC. I get on, I get a few questions, I answer as best I can, and I’m out. Two tidbits on my spot today:
It seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is a new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any paid tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.


Another question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, with 3D Object Capture using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.

                    <span>Hey,
this week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.

A Clarke! (but not that one).
 We’re closing out the top-3 in our draft board, and we’ve got another defenseman on deck!
Coming in at third overall is Brandt Clarke, and it’s been a bit of a weird year for him. Clarke played his 2019-20 season with the Barrie Colts of the OHL, but because of the COVID restrictions in Ontario, the OHL didn’t play a season at all this year. So, to make sure he was still able to get some games in, Clarke shipped off to Slovakia for 26 games with Nove Zamky. Unconventional? Yes. But it was a very good season, all the same.

Team: HC Nove Zamky (Slovakia)
Statistics: 5 G, 10 A in 26 GP

                    <span>Circa 1842, ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige released an 11-print series revealing the secrets of shadow puppetry performances. From the description of one of these woodblock prints held in the collection at The Minneapolis Institute of Art:
As comic entertainment, shadow performances were among the many diversions, including music and dance, offered at teahouse parties during the Edo period. In the eleven-print series Improvised Shadow Performances, Hiroshige depicted figures making shadows on shōji screens by contorting their bodies. The images demonstrate how to create ingenious shadows and could easily have been used as a how-to guide for clever shadow making.

                    <span>Who Are You, Charlie Brown? is a forthcoming feature-length documentary about the Peanuts comic strip and its creator, Charles Schulz.
Honoring the “everyman” creator, Charles “Sparky” Schulz, “Who Are You, Charlie Brown?” celebrates the significance and global multi-generational popularity of the comic strip and its timeless artistry and design to profile the man whose simple characters would touch the lives of millions through the decades and become beloved cultural icons. Featuring interviews with Jean Schulz, the widow of Charles Schulz, along with Drew Barrymore, Al Roker, Kevin Smith, Billie Jean King, Paul Feig, Ira Glass, Noah Schnapp, Miya Cech, Keith L. Williams, Chip Kidd, Lynn Johnston, Robb Armstrong and more, the documentary interweaves a new animated story that follows Charlie Brown on a quest to discover himself.


Narrated by Lupita Nyong’o, the film premieres on Apple TV+ on June 25.

                    <span>Eddy Cue, in an interview with Micah Singleton for Billboard:
One of the first people that told me about Dolby Atmos was Adam
Levine. I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he
was like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song
and he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do
with this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this
evolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with
this, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to
do this.
So we went after the labels and are going to the artists and
educating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because
we have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a
simple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through
this software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This
requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit
back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the
right things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s
worth it. […]
To me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for
music what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch
television that’s not in HD?
One of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take
an old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on
low-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things
were recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back
to a lot of the songs and be able to do this.
The article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but the full interview is available on Apple News — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.

                    <span>Jasmine Whitaker, writing for Adobe:
Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Illustrator and InDesign
will run natively on Apple Silicon devices. While users have been
able to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,
today’s development means a considerable boost in speed and
performance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent
increase in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent
improvement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.
Specific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster. Just from porting to run natively on Apple Silicon.
And we’ve only seen Apple’s consumer Apple Silicon chips for Mac.

                    <span>Speaking of playing the lottery, Philadelphia is getting in on the lottery-for-getting-vaccinated trend:
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced today the launch of “Philly Vax Sweepstakes,” a series of three citywide drawings designed to give Philadelphians extra motivation to get their vaccination against COVID-19 as the city fully reopens this summer.
A total of 36 vaccinated Philadelphians will win cash prizes up to $50,000, totaling nearly $400,000 in giveaways. In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.
I really do love the idea of these lotteries and giveaway promotions. It’s innumeracy that leads some people to grossly miscalculate the risks vs. rewards of getting vaccinated, and it’s innumeracy that leads people to play lotteries. Sweepstakes for getting vaccinated put innumeracy to work.

                    <span>Hello! I’m very slowly
working on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:
If you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?
Of course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into
bugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I
figured them out!)
I got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to
talk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this
post, I’ll just try to classify them.
Here are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible
to understand. Each one of them has a bunch of sub variants which are bolded below.

A little more Wolverines love around here. 
 We’re rolling right along with our draft board, and coming in at second overall is another member of the University of Michigan’s stellar freshman class, in Matthew Beniers.
If you caught any of this year’s World Juniors, this is probably a name that you’re familiar with. Beniers picked up three points in seven games with the United States on their way to scooping up a goal medal, and while all eyes were on many of the big names on that team—2019 draftees like Cam York, Alex Turcotte, and Trevor Zegras—Beniers stood out for his motor that was helping to drive success for the US’s depth lines. 
His international success was just the cherry on top of a really solid season with Michigan, which saw him sco…</span>

There’s a lot of directions the Flyers could go, which do you want to see them go in?
 Sign Dougie Hamilton? Trade for Seth Jones? Bring in some grit to the forward core? Blow up the core? Stand pat?  These are all options that have been floated around this team since it became obvious they were out of playoff contention. This is a huge off-season for Chuck Fletcher and the Philadelphia Flyers, who need to decide what they want this team to look like.
We as the fans need to know before games begin later this year to kick off the 2021-22 season, what is the Flyers identity? Before COVID shut the NHL season down in March 2020, the Flyers had a clear idea of what the team was. They were outstanding defensively, out-worked teams in the corne…</span>

                    <span>For the Washington Post, Michele Norris wonders what it will take for the US to finally and fully acknowledge its history of slavery.
America experienced 246 years of slavery before it was officially ended with the passage of the 13th Amendment. That was followed by decades of legal segregation and oppression under Jim Crow, followed by a period of willful blindness and denial. A tourist from a foreign land might well conclude that the Confederacy had actually won the Civil War, based on the number of monuments, buildings and boulevards still named for heroes of its defeated army. The real truth of our shared history was a casualty of that war and, like any wound left untended, the results can be catastrophic.

                    <span>This is a 3-minute clip of The Concert (or The Perils of Everybody) by choreographer Jerome Robbins, in which the dancers are intentionally, and comically, out of sync. You can see why it’s colloquially called the Mistake Waltz. Open Culture’s Ayun Halliday has collected several more of these performances in this post.
It must be incredibly hard for dancers to execute this piece, to deliberately perform out of step with the music and their fellow performers after a lifetime of practice &amp; performance designed to drill the opposite instinct to them. Bravo!

                    <span>Filmmaker Morgan Neville (who did the Fred Rogers doc Won’t You Be My Neighbor?) has directed a documentary about Anthony Bourdain called Roadrunner that opens in theaters on July 16.
It’s not where you go. It’s what you leave behind… Chef, writer, adventurer, provocateur: Anthony Bourdain lived his life unabashedly. Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at how an anonymous chef became a world-renowned cultural icon. From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet From Stardom, Won’t You Be My Neighbor?), this unflinching look at Bourdain reverberates with his presence, in his own voice and in the way he indelibly impacted the world around him.


This trailer makes me want to buy a movie ticket — and about 10 plane tickets. So looking forward to this. I need more unabashed living in my life.

                    <span>Yale historian Timothy Snyder has been one of the most prominent &amp; insistent voices warning against the rise of authoritarianism &amp; fascism in the United States in recent years — you may remember his 20 lessons from the 20th century on fighting authoritarianism from November 2016 and his more recent piece on the right’s coup attempt on January 6th.
Over the weekend, Snyder published a short piece about what he believes will happen as a result of the 1/6 insurrection and the Republicans’ ongoing effort to push their Big Lie about election fraud — basically the end of democracy in America.
I have the Cassandra feeling this spring because it is so obvious where all of this is heading. President Trump tells a big lie that elections are rigged. This authorizes him and others to seek power in ext…</span>

                    <span>My thanks to Quill for sponsoring last week at DF. Quill is a new messaging app for teams, made by people who love messaging — many of them grew up on IRC. Messaging is their favorite way to collaborate, but not if it’s overwhelming or disorganized. Unlike a lot of messaging platforms, Quill looks great — on both iOS and MacOS.
It’s a more deliberate way to chat. Try it for free.

It’s not about giving in to every little demand being lobbed at them. It’s about collecting information, determining what the right thing to do is, and doing it the Apple Way. When Apple does that and does it right, the results are fantastic.
Let’s hope we see some of that Apple shine through this week.

                    <span>Good column (and video) from Joanna Stern on Apple’s “walled garden”. The people who use the term “walled garden” in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that’s not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice — and the walls and gates can be what makes them nice. That’s been a recurring theme in the testimony from Apple executives in the Epic trial. Asked about rules and limits on iOS that Epic presents as nefarious — nothing but tricks to lock users in — Apple witnesses typically responded by presenting them as features. That iOS is wildly popular not despite the “walls”, but because of them.
It’s a trade-off, for example, that anything you can install on iOS can be trivially uninstalled just by deleting the app icon from your home screen. The downside is that iOS doesn’t support any third-party ideas that would require system-level background agents or extensions. I can name dozens of great Mac utilities that I’d enjoy, if not love, on iOS, but which can’t exist on iOS because of the rules. That sucks. But those same rules mean there’s no way to mess up your iPhone or iPad by installing something you don’t like and which is difficult to uninstall. That’s great.
Better than “walled garden”, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They’re fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They’re also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks. Public parks are great too — in very different ways. We should have great public parks, and we should have great open computing platforms. But not every park should necessarily be public, and not every closed computing platform would be better off open.

                    <span>Screen Times:
The bottom line is, the viewing experience in the HBO Max app is
now horrifically bad and almost unusable unless you’re planning
just to play and pause. If you need to do anything else, don’t get
your hopes up.
The fact that they completely broke fast-forwarding and rewinding is mind boggling. Those aren’t exactly obscure power user features. Just use the standard video player. I don’t know how this update shipped. (The worst part is, my wife and I are hooked on Mare of Easttown, and have been binging it all week. Really sucks not being able to do anything except play and pause.)

                    <span>1,400 words to say they’d prefer a policy that allows teams within Apple to determine their own remote work policies. Good communication is to the point, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel “unheard”. It’s hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ✊🍆 vibes. The “formal requests” at the end about employees with disabilities and the “environmental impact of returning to onsite [sic] in-person work” are such transparent pandering. (I have never once heard of Apple not doing whatever it takes not only to accommodate employees with any disability, but to make them feel welcome.)
And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days remote is a huge change for Apple.
Given that these letters keep leaking to Zoe Schiffer at The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple is that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot of people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a mistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack. Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on site” policy wasn’t a request for comments — it was a decision — and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.

                    <span>Nick Clegg, VP of global affairs at Facebook:
We are today announcing new enforcement protocols to be applied in
exceptional cases such as this, and we are confirming the
time-bound penalty consistent with those protocols which we are
applying to Mr. Trump’s accounts. Given the gravity of the
circumstances that led to Mr. Trump’s suspension, we believe his
actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit
the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols.
We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the
date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.
As part of this decision, Facebook is rescinding the special privileges heretofore extended to world leaders and political figures that largely exempted them from Facebook’s content policies on the grounds of “newsworthiness”.

                    <span>Free Mac utility from Andreas Hegenberg, developer of BetterTouchTool and BetterSnapTool:
KeyboardCleanTool is a super simple little tool which blocks all
Keyboard and TouchBar input.
In 2011 Apple rejected the app for the Mac App Store because
apparently it’s “not useful”, however I often use it to clean my
MacBook keyboard without producing annoying input.
I have also heard of people who use it to let their toddlers
pretend they work on a computer.
The app has been around for 10 years, but I don’t recall hearing of it before. It’s more useful than ever today, because modern MacBooks will power on with the press of any key on the keyboard. It used to be that you could wipe your keyboard clean while powered down, but Apple changed that a few years ago, apparently because a fair number of users were confused how to turn their MacBooks on, now that the power/Touch ID button has no power icon. (Joanna Stern and I talked about this on the most recent episode of The Talk Show.)
KeyboardCleanTool is a great solution.
Update: See also: Shaun Inman’s Little Fingers, a similarly-purposed utility that also blocks input from the mouse/trackpad.

Bing, the search engine owned by Microsoft, is not displaying

anniversary of China’s violent crackdown on protests in Tiananmen
Square in 1989. […]
Bing displays ordinary, non-image search results for “tank man”
when searching from a U.S. IP address; the issue only impacts the
Images and Videos tabs. Google, for its part, displays both when
connecting from the same IP address.
Motherboard verified that the issue also impacts image searches on
Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, which both use Bing. Neither company

side wall, within easy reach of Winston’s arm, a large oblong slit
protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of
waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of
thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at
short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were
nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due
for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying
about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest
memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on
a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden
somewhere in the recesses of the building.

                    <span>Another Mac utility worth your attention: Alexander Jaehrling’s PDF Diff is a $20 app for comparing the text differences between two PDFs. Last July I asked:
What’s the best tool for diffing PDF files? Is it Acrobat? Tell me it’s not Acrobat. But if it’s Acrobat OK I’ll break a years-long streak and install Acrobat.
PDF Diff wasn’t out at the time, but I wish it had been. It’s the best tool I’ve found for this.

Everyone has their wishlist for things they want to see on
Monday’s WWDC keynote. Here is my anti-wish list — things I do
not want to see. […]
More multitasking gestures in iPad OS. Make multitasking
spatial, or make it stop. I hate user interfaces that are driven
by guessing.


More features in macOS that I’ll never use. It’s great as-is,
just fix bugs and everyone will be happy.

                    <span>Dan Moren, writing at Macworld:
Multitasking on the iPad is, to put it generously, a mess. Split
View and Slide Over, first introduced in 2015’s iOS 9 and refined
a couple of times over the years, have always had the feeling of a
band-aid slapped over a mortal wound. Their limitations (like the
dance of getting an app that’s not in your dock into Split View)
and awkward gestures (how many times have you activated Slide Over
when you meant to simply swipe) feel cumbersome, especially
compared to the multitasking we’ve always had on the Mac.
So I’m hoping that 2021 is the year that Apple finally cracks
multitasking on the iPad. I’m not sure exactly what that looks
like; there are those who argue for the wholesale transplant of
macOS’s windowing system, but that seems as though it might be
another imprecise fit borne out of convenience rather than actual
appropriateness. Fundamentally, though, the iPad has always been
built around the idea of one app on the screen at any time, and
it’s clear that simply won’t do in a world where people expect to
be able to run multiple apps at once.
It’s amazing how often I make a slide-over Safari “window” on iPad without wanting to. And then I’m stuck with a new Safari instance with no actual tabs. You can get into Slide Over inadvertently, and if you do, it’s hard to undo it. It’s like instantly creating detritus you need to clean up. iPadOS is the only GUI system I’m aware of that has “windows” that don’t have close buttons.
My wife uses her iPad Pro more than any other device. She loves it. But Slide Over was driving her nuts until I showed her how to turn it off. “Why is that on by default?” she asked.

                    <span>Ben Dummett, reporting for the WSJ:
Prosus said it struck a $1.8 billion deal to acquire Stack
Overflow, an online community for software developers, in a bet on
growing demand for online tech learning. […]
Prosus, one of Europe’s most valuable tech companies, is best
known as the largest shareholder in Chinese internet and
videogaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Listed in Amsterdam,
Prosus signaled its appetite for deal making when it sold a small
portion of its equity stake in Tencent in April for $14.6 billion.
The Stack Overflow deal ranks among Prosus’s biggest acquisitions.
Acquisition prices have skyrocketed since 2012, but still, that’s almost two Instagrams.

A change to TikTok’s U.S. privacy policy on Wednesday
introduced a new section that says the social video app “may
collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from
its users’ content. This includes things like “faceprints and
voiceprints,” the policy explained. Reached for comment,
TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated
the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about
the information it automatically collects from users, but said
it would ask for consent in the case such data collection
practices began.
Wonderful. Why don’t we just give you copies of the keys to our homes and our ATM PIN codes, too?

The United States is roughly on track to meet President Biden’s
goal of getting at least one Covid-19 shot into the arms of 70
percent of adults by July 4 — if the current vaccination pace
holds. But demand for vaccines has decreased in much of the
country in recent weeks, and the promising national numbers (about
63 percent of adults have received at least one shot) do not
reflect the uneven rates among states.
Even if the country as a whole reaches the national target, at
least 30 states probably will not. And a handful are unlikely to
reach the 70 percent mark before the end of the year, a New York
Times analysis shows, potentially prolonging the pandemic.
On the bright side, even our worst-performing states on COVID vaccination rates — Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming,…</span>

                    <span>Apple’s Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the
biometric sensor; it doesn’t store biometric templates, perform
biometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,
having to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).
The Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be
securely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be
used, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and
matching operations and enforces security policies in the same way
it would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the
pairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
that is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the
user if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely
paired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure
pairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
keyboards.
So I was wrong in my article on “secure intent” this week — the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does not contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it’s paired. But this contradicts the Platform Security page about “secure intent”, which states: “the connection is a physical link — from a physical button to the Secure Enclave”. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac’s Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.
The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are
compatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch
ID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the
Secure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match — and
vice versa.
I did not know this — nifty.

United Airlines aims to bring back supersonic travel before the
decade is over with a plane that is currently just an artist’s
drawing — even the prototype hasn’t flown yet.
The airline said Thursday that it plans to buy 15 jets from Boom
Supersonic with an option for 35 more once the start-up company
designs a plane that flies faster than the speed of sound while
meeting safety and environmental standards.
United hopes to carry passengers on the plane in 2029. The airline
said the plane will reduce flights between London and the New York
area to just 3.5 hours and make Tokyo only 6 hours from San
Francisco.
The last commercial supersonic flight was in 2003, when the Concordes were grounded.

                    <span>A Brooklyn company called Pliant Energy Systems has developed a prototype of an amphibious robot that can swim, skate, slither, and crawl through water and over all different kinds of terrain. The secret is an undulating propulsion system that can modified on the fly to adapt to different conditions.
Velox can use several modes of locomotion found in the animal kingdom using just one pair of “fins”. These fins are best described as four-dimensional objects with a hyperbolic geometry that allows the robot to swim like a ray, crawl like a millipede, jet like a squid, and slide like a snake.
A craft equipped with this system has unprecedented freedom to travel through a range of environments in a single mission. As an underwater vehicle, the robot’s ability to instantly reverse direction and do quick turns make it ideal for task such as coral reef inspection or dragon fish hunting where a craft must rapidly maneuver to look around and between objects.

                    <span>Sean Donnelly’s mother got sucked into the world of QAnon conspiracy theories, so he made a little video about it, including documenting some bets he made with her about whether or not Biden would still be in office 3 months after the inauguration or if Tom Hanks &amp; Oprah would soon be arrested for pedophilia. Remember when Baby Boomers were all concerned that the internet was going to be harmful for their Gen X and Millennial children and grandchildren? And now all these Boomers are getting brainwashed by Facebook and Fox News? Good stuff. :|

In this short film, we meet three Foley artists who work at Footsteps Studios, a custom designed facility in rural Ontario that includes a massive warehouse of props that can make any sound you can dream of. This video is full of lovely little moments and details — recommended.

Upset by reports from The Washington Post and other outlets
highlighting its measly readership and concerns that it could
detract from a social media platform he wants to launch later this
year, Trump ordered his team Tuesday to put the blog out of its
misery, advisers said.
On its last day, the site received just 1,500 shares or comments
on Facebook and Twitter — a staggering drop for someone whose
every tweet once garnered hundreds of thousands of reactions.
You hate to see it.

                    <span>Josephine Wolff, writing for Slate:
By all means, opt out of Amazon Sidewalk if anything about
this program makes you uncomfortable or if (despite already owning
a Ring or Echo) you don’t trust the company enough to share a
little of your home network with your neighbors safely. You’re
under no obligation to participate in this mesh networking
experiment, and it probably would have made more sense for Amazon
to at least launch the program with an opt-in model that gave
people more time to learn about how it works and whether they want
to be involved.
But if you’re just learning about mesh networks for the first time
and aren’t sure what to think, or whether this is something to be
very worried about, I really don’t think it is. If you’ve already
reconciled yourself to the privacy implications of owning an Echo
or a Ring, the additional privacy and security drawbacks of
participating in Sidewalk seem very limited and the benefits are
potentially considerable, for you and for everyone around you.
I like this take. The thing to consider is whether you trust Echo and Ring devices with your privacy. If you do, you might as well participate in Sidewalk. It’s not that different, conceptually, from Apple’s Find My network.

                    <span>Brian Krebs:
Fake, positive reviews have infiltrated nearly every corner of
life online these days, confusing consumers while offering an
unwelcome advantage to fraudsters and sub-par products everywhere.
Happily, identifying and tracking these fake reviewer accounts is
often the easiest way to spot scams. Here’s the story of how bogus
reviews on a counterfeit Microsoft Authenticator browser extension
exposed dozens of other extensions that siphoned personal and
financial data.
After hearing from a reader about a phony Microsoft Authenticator
extension that appeared on the Google Chrome Store,
KrebsOnSecurity began looking at the profile of the account that
created it. There were a total of five reviews on the extension
before it was removed: Three Google users gave it one star,
warning people to stay far away from it; but two of the reviewers
awarded it between three and four stars.
Fraudulent reviews are a scourge. Apple’s App Store is riddled with them — I’m not sure I’ve seen a single story about a scammy app in the App Store that didn’t have a bunch of 5-star reviews. Amazon product pages are riddled with fake reviews too. There’s a huge cottage industry in paying for fake reviews in any online forum where reviews can come from anyone.
I don’t know what the answer is. Users think they like reading reviews from other users, but they have no idea how utterly untrustworthy unverified reviews are. There’d be outrage if Apple or Amazon simply pulled the plug on user-submitted reviews, or wiped the slate clean by nuking existing reviews and starting over with some sort of “verified reviewer” system. But the status quo is a cesspool of scammy reviews that many users believe they can trust. It’s a mess.

                    <span>From Our Favourite Uses of Typography in Watches:
Good typography should be almost unnoticeable. Blending seamlessly into the rest of the design, it should tell you everything you need to know, without you being aware of it. Despite the many restrictions that are applied to dial layout, the creativity that can be seen in typography across horology is quite staggering. To put it simply, typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. As the dial is the main point of interaction with a watch, it is arguably one of its most important parts, and certainly one that can produce the most emotion. This is why typeface can play such a vital, yet subtle, role in how we experience and feel about a certain piece.

                    <span>WHAAAAAAATTT the hell did I just watch? In 2016, Luke Aikins became the first person to intentionally jump and land without the aid of a parachute or wingsuit — check out the video above to see how he does it. At one point, his heart rate is displayed on the screen and I’m certain that mine was in the same ballpark just before he landed. I recommend you also watch a video of the jump narrated by Aikins as he talks through what’s happening before, during, and after the jump.
See also Gary Connery’s 2012 jump — he fell 2400 feet from a helicopter and landed on a huge pile of cardboard boxes with the aid of a wingsuit, which slowed his vertical velocity to about 15 mph.
FYI: The jump height of 25,000 feet seems impressive (and it’s probably trickier hitting the target from higher up) but in terms of speed, about 1500 feet is sufficient for a freefalling human in the spread-eagle position to reach their maximum (terminal) velocity of ~120 mph. Anything over 1500 feet, about half the height of El Capitan’s granite face, doesn’t add any additional speed. (via @mikeindustries)

                    <span>Inspired by space-saving flat-packed furniture, scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a technique for making pasta shapes that start out flat when dry but “morph” into their final 3D shapes when cooked. The secret is stamping different groove patterns into the pasta dough.
The solution: something Wang, Yao, and their co-authors term “groove-based transient morphing.” They found that stamping flat pasta sheets with different groove patterns enabled them to control the final pasta shape after cooking. According to the authors, the grooves increase how long it takes to cook that part of the pasta. So those areas expand less than the smooth areas, giving rise to many different shapes.
The team found that the pasta reached its maximum bending angle after about 12 minutes and retained this angle for around 20 minutes before it began to bend back. The researchers were able to produce simple helical and cone shapes, as well as more complex saddles and twists (the latter achieved by introducing double-sided grooves).


I am assuming those grooves would also aid in holding sauce better, a topic we’ve delved into recently. You can read the full research paper on the morphing pasta here. (via the prepared)

                    <span>Stack Overflow co-founder Joel Spolsky:
Today we’re pleased to announce that Stack Overflow is joining
Prosus. Prosus is an investment and holding company, which
means that the most important part of this announcement is that
Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the
exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to
the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t
expect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business
of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance,
and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in
place: we just have different owners now.
This is, in some ways, the best possible outcome. Stack Overflow
stays independent. The company has plenty of cash on hand to
expand and deliver more features and fix the old broken ones.
Stack Overflow is far from perfect — what isn’t? — but the world would be a far worse place without it, so here’s to hoping that Prosus is a good steward.

Otherwise, no shame whatsoever. It’s hard to see how they could make these look more like iPad’s hardware and software.

                    <span>Jason Snell, in his wishlist for Mac news at next week’s WWDC:
One feature that the Mac desperately needs from iPadOS is, believe
it or not, Shortcuts. I’ve written elsewhere about this,
but essentially it’s easier for me to create automations for many
tasks on iOS than it is on macOS — and it shouldn’t be that way.
Shortcuts fulfills the promise of Automator in ways that Automator
never did, and while it’s got a lot of room to grow, it’s clearly
the future of automation on Apple’s platforms. Add in actions that
can run AppleScript, Automator workflows, and shell scripts, and
we’ll really have something.
I’ve gotten more into Shortcuts in the last few months, and I really hope this happens. I just wonder how Shortcuts on Mac could offer actions for things that aren’t possible on iOS, like Snell’s suggestion for being able to run AppleScript and shell scripts. I suppose they’d just generate an error on iOS, and you could use them in a cross-platform shortcut by conditionally testing whether the shortcut is running on MacOS — pretty much how it works now when you have a shortcut containing actions that require a third-party app to be installed.

                    <span>Hello! Quick announcement: I opened a new print zine
store last week, so now you can buy print
copies of my zines! To start I’ve printed 350 copies of each of the “Bite
Size…” zines.
Here’s a photo of the front of the zines and some stickers:
and the back covers:



Here are some notes about how the store works:
great print quality!
I worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,
so they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m
delighted with how they turned out.
When I originally started working on this project I thought about using a
print-on-demand company briefly (it sounds so convenient!) but I ordered test
prints from all the ones I could find and it turns out that none of them could
produce the print qualit…</span>

                    <span>Juggling, from the usual angle, looks like a very hectic endeavor — balls and clubs and hands flying everywhere. But if you get an overhead view, as in this video from Taylor Glenn, you can see that often there’s very little movement in two of the three dimensions. The mastery of these small movements combined with the sweeping up-and-down motions creates a compelling illusion for ground-based viewers. The power of a different perspective.

                    <span>For a talk at the Ignite conference, Marcin Wichary created a looping video about looping videos — you know, when the action in a video loops back over previous scenes, adding new layers of interaction as time goes on. (Think Marty McFly revisiting scenes from Back to the Future in Back to the Future 2.) Most impressively: he did it all live — and here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how.

But even presuming that this story of natural selection is right, it doesn’t explain why, 10 million years later, I like wine so much. “It should puzzle us more than it does,” Edward Slingerland writes in his wide-ranging and provocative new book, Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization, “that one of the greatest foci of human ingenuity and concentrated effort over the past millennia has been the problem of how to get drunk.” The damage done by alcohol is profound: impaired cognition and motor skills, belligerence, injury, and vulnerability to all sorts of predatio…</span>

                    <span>Due to recent government reports, declassified data, media interest in those data &amp; reports, and a long-simmering interest by the public, UFOs are back in the public imagination. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who is searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, says that there’s little chance that UFOs are aliens.
I understand that U.F.O. sightings, which date back at least to 1947, are synonymous in the popular imagination with evidence of extraterrestrials. But scientifically speaking, there is little to warrant that connection. There are excellent reasons to search for extraterrestrial life, but there are equally excellent reasons not to conclude that we have found evidence of it with U.F.O. sightings.


If UFOs are alien craft, we would never see them:
There are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently visited by aliens, why don’t they just land on the White House lawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative, perhaps best exemplified by the TV show “The X-Files,” that these creatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us. But if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem surprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures technologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances between the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams at night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.


More people talking about a thing doesn’t make it credible. More people talking about potential evidence of a thing doesn’t make it credible. Evidence makes something credible.

In January, I challenged myself to do something creative every day, a habit that I’ve continued (although not quite as diligently). In February, I challenged myself to do two things every day: read a book and exercise. I continued challenging myself to exercise in March, but […]</span>

                    <span>We love messaging (and most of us grew up using IRC.) It’s our favorite way of collaborating, but not if it’s overwhelming and disorganized. We grew exhausted having to skim thousands of messages every day to keep up, so we built something better. A more deliberate way to chat.

                    <span>Hey,
it’s been a long while and I’ll start with a big sorry to all my loyal readers over the past years. I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget i…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>macOS Big Sur 11.4, which was released this morning, addresses a zero-day vulnerability that could allow attackers to piggyback off of apps like Zoom, taking secret screenshots and surrepetiously recording the screen.





Jamf, a mobile device management company, today highlighted a security issue that allowed Privacy preferences to be bypassed, providing an attacker with Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, and other permissions without a user&#x27;s consent.



The bypass was actively exploited in the wild, and was discovered by Jamf when analyzing XCSSET malware. The XCSSET malware has been out in the wild since 2020, but Jamf noticed an uptick in recent activity and discovered a new variant.



Once installed on a victim&#x27;s system, the malware was used specifically for taking screenshots of the user&#x27;s desktop with no additional permissions required. Jamf said that it could be used to bypass other permissions as well, as long as the donor application the malware piggybacked off of had that permission enabled.



Jamf has a full rundown on how the exploit worked, and the company says that Apple addressed the vulnerability in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.4, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that a fix has indeed been enabled in macOS 11.4, so Mac users should update their software as soon as possible.

                    <span>This is a photo of a tiny tiny snippet of the universe, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Every object you see in the photo is a staggeringly massive galaxy that contains hundreds of billions of stars along with all sort of other things.
Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is well over one hundred thousand light years across. We only see a pitiful portion of it. Although it contains several hundred billion stars in its expanse, we can only see a fraction of a fraction of them.
And even that doesn’t fully capture the essence of a galaxy, which also has planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and more. Galaxies are colossal objects, their true nature only becoming apparent to us a century ago.


I know I’ve posted photos like this before, but every time I see something like this, my mind boggles anew at the sheer scale and magnitude of it all and I just have to share it.
P.S. And Earth contains the only sentient life in the entire universe? Lol.

                    <span>Using data from the United States Geological Survey, River Runner visualizes the path taken by a raindrop from its landing spot to its eventual endpoint. Just click on any spot in the US and it maps out the path the drop would take, complete with a satellite fly-through of the route. I spent many happy minutes playing with this, although the endpoint of “Canada” for a raindrop that lands in my Vermont yard was somewhat unsatisfying.

                    <span>Translating sites, search engines, social networks, browsers, ISPs, and other internet entities into geographic features, Martin Vargic has created a map of the internet circa 2021.
It includes several thousand of some of the most popular websites, represented as distinct “countries”, which are grouped together with others of similar type or category, forming dozens of distinct clusters, regions and continents that stretch throughout the map, such as “news sites”, “search engines”, “social networks”, “e-commerce”, “adult entertainment”, “file sharing”, “software companies” and so much more.  In the center of it all can be found ISPs and web browsers, which form the core and backbone of the internet as we know it, while the far south is the domain of the mysterious “dark web”.

                    <span>The three week Epic Games v. Apple trial wrapped up today, with a series of debates that were held in lieu of traditional closing arguments. The wrap up follows Apple CEO Tim Cook&#x27;s testimony last week, which saw him grilled by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Apple&#x27;s App Store policies.





As outlined by Protocol, at the conclusion of the trial, Rogers aimed to get at the heart of the dispute and determine what remedies might ultimately be appropriate.



As she did earlier in the trial, Rogers hinted that she may be leaning toward something of a compromise with a ruling that would see Apple required to allow apps like Fortnite to direct users to make purchases on the web rather than in apps, something that&#x27;s currently forbidden by the ‌App Store‌ rules.

                    <span>New MacBook Pro models are coming at WWDC, according to leaker Jon Prosser who has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple&#x27;s plans.





Prosser provided no additional information, but there are new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the works. The new MacBook Pros will feature the most radical redesign to the MacBook Pro lineup since 2016.



Apple is planning to reintroduce the MagSafe port, and the 2021 MacBook Pro models will feature an HDMI port and an SD card reader in addition to a trio of Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, and multiple color options are a possibility. 



There will be no Touch Bar included, with Apple returning to a traditional row of function keys, and there will be a redesigned thermal system to accommodate the upgraded Apple silicon chips that the machines are expected to include.



Bloomberg recently said that the new MacBook Pro models will feature 10-core Apple silicon chips with eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, along with 16 or 32-core GPU options and support for up to 64GB RAM.



No other sources have indicated that the MacBook Pro models will be coming at WWDC, and it has been atypical for Apple to debut hardware at the event in recent years, but it is not unheard of. The new MacBook Pro models are expected to enter production in the second half of 2021, and reliable sources that include Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have suggested a launch in the second half of the year.

                    <span>Apple last Friday released the first M1 iMac models to customers and began selling them in stores, and iFixit has now started one of its traditional teardowns on the new machines.





iFixit is tearing down the mid-tier purple ‌iMac‌ model with an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and 8GB RAM. It&#x27;s worth noting that the internals of this model will look different than the internals of the base model with a 7-core GPU as the two machines have different cooling systems.



The base ‌iMac‌ has a single cooling fan and a heat sink while the higher-end 8-core GPU models have two fans and a heat pipe along with heat sinks, so expect the internals to look different if you have a 7-core GPU ‌iMac‌.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.6 and iPadOS 14.6 to the public. The iOS 14.6 update isn&#x27;t quite as significant as the iOS 14.5 update that preceded it, but it still introduces a number of notable new features. We&#x27;ve highlighted everything that&#x27;s new in iOS and iPadOS 14.6 below.





Apple Music Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio Support


Apple in May introduced two new Apple Music features, which ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are getting for no additional cost. ‌Apple Music‌ Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos will offer up an immersive, multi-dimensional audio experience that lets artists mix music in a way that makes it sound like the notes are coming from all around you.





Apple is also upgrading its entire music catalog to Lossless Audio, which preserves the details in the origina…</span>

                    <span>Apple alongside the second-generation Apple TV 4K debuted a redesigned version of the Siri Remote, which is now available to customers with new ‌Apple TV‌ orders and as a $60 standalone replacement for the original ‌Siri‌ Remote.

We picked up the updated ‌Siri‌ Remote to see if it&#x27;s worth picking up if you have an original ‌Apple TV‌ 4K or HD and are tired of the first iteration of the remote, which has several shortcomings.



Apple entirely overhauled the ‌Siri‌ Remote&#x27;s design. It has an all-aluminum body that does away with the touchpad interface, instead adopting a touch-based clickpad and several additional buttons for control purposes.

                    <span>Following its announcement last month, Apple today officially flipped the switch to allow parents to share their Apple Card with their teenagers or friends and the ability for spouses to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌ account. However, one notable feature that didn&#x27;t get released today is the ability for two separate ‌Apple Card‌ accounts to be merged into one.





Apple announced the feature last month but didn&#x27;t specifically pin a release date. Now, in a new support document, Apple says that starting later on in July, users will be able to merge two existing ‌Apple Card‌ accounts into one, and in doing so, be able to combine their credit limits. 

Coming July 2021: You will be able to invite another ‌Apple Card‌ owner to combine credit limits and form one co-owned account.1
The ability to share an ‌Apple Card‌ with iCloud Family members above 13 years old and the ability to co-own an ‌Apple Card‌ were released today as part of the iOS 14.6 update.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.6, with it bringing support for Apple Podcasts subscriptions and new support for Apple Card Family. Announced last month, ‌Apple Card‌ Family allows families to share a single ‌Apple Card‌ with users above 13 years old with the ability to set a spending limit.





Following its release, Apple has shared two how-to videos on how exactly to share an Apple Card with your teenager or friend and how to co-own a single Apple Card with your significant other. The process for sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with a friend or teenager is enabled within the Wallet app on iOS 14.6 or later and requires that you be in an iCloud Family with the person you wish to share the card with.  








Last month, Apple also announced the ability for couples to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌, allowing them to build their credit score together. The process is similar to sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with your teenager or friend but requires you to share your spouse&#x27;s annual income. 








‌Apple Card‌ Family is available today with the iOS 14.6 update.

To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery, it needs to be placed on a charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



watchOS 7.5 introduces support for Apple Card Family and subscription content in the Podcasts app. In Malaysia and Peru, it enables the ECG app and irregular heart rate rhythm notifications.



The update also includes support for the new Pride faces that are designed to accompany the 2021 Pride bands that Apple released today. There are two new &quot;Pride Woven&quot; faces to choose from in an animated rectangle or circle design.

tvOS 14.6, which is a free update, can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the Apple TV by going to System &gt; Software Update. ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates enabled will be upgraded to tvOS 14.5 automatically.



tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing primarily on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than outward-facing changes. tvOS 14.6 lays the groundwork for the new Apple Music Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio features.



Spatial Audio offers an immersive audio experience that makes it sound like music is coming from all around you, while Lossless Audio will provide higher-quality songs that sound exactly like they do when artists record them in the studio.



At launch in June, thousands of tracks will feature Spatial Audio support, and more than 20,000 songs will support Lossless Audio. By the end of the year, 75 million songs will support it.

                    <span>This past November, the Apple TV app made its debut on Xbox gaming consoles, now, the Apple TV app is gaining support for Dolby Vision on Xbox, offering viewers improved high dynamic range paired with Dolby Atmos for a truly cinematic experience.





Xbox says that to enable Dolby Vision for ‌Apple TV‌ on Xbox, users must first have a compatible TV that supports high dynamic range. With compatible TVs, users will find a new toggle under &quot;TV &amp; display options&quot; in their Xbox settings tab to enable Dolby Vision. Additionally, not all ‌Apple TV‌ content will initially support Dolby Vision. 

To start experiencing it with a Dolby Vision compatible TV, you need to have “Allow Dolby Vision” enabled and checked in Settings &gt; General &gt; TV &amp; display options &gt; Video Modes on your console. You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.
The ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices such as the PS4, and select smart TVs. This is part of Apple&#x27;s recent strategy to expand its services business to more customers.

                    <span>Anker today is introducing a new set of gallium nitride (GaN) USB-C chargers that offer fast charging speeds for mobile devices in a design that&#x27;s smaller than ever. The new Nano II line is available in 30W, 45W, and 65W versions, and Anker says it has improved the chips and internal layout of its chargers to deliver greater efficiency while generating less heat.





The 30-watt charger measures in at just 31.5 mm by 30.4 mm and about 38 mm deep. (The UK versions of all three chargers are about 1.5 mm deeper due to their prong design.) It can fast-charge an iPhone or iPad, and even fully support the latest MacBook Air.



The 45-watt version offers a bit more power to be able to charge a wider variety of notebooks and other gadgets, and it measures 37.7 mm by 35 mm by about 41 mm. It also features foldable prongs to make it less likely to be damaged or to damage other items when tossed in together.



The 65-watt version can fully power devices all the way up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it too features foldable prongs. The charger measures 41.7 mm by 36 mm by about 44 mm.



All three chargers are available for preorder on Amazon and Anker.com for US customers, priced at $29.99, $35.99, and $39.99 respectively. Versions for UK and EU customers will be available at a later date.

According to recently published Apple Support documents, the ‌iPad Pro‌&#x27;s Liquid Retina XDR display is designed to improve on &quot;the trade-offs of typical local dimming systems, where the extreme brightness of LEDs might cause a slight blooming effect,&quot; suggesting that the effect should be minimized.

                    <span>Apple has filed the unreleased &quot;Beats Studio Buds&quot; in the FCC or Federal Communications Commission database under model numbers A2512 and A2513. The new filings come after the reveal of the new earbuds last week within the release candidates for iOS and tvOS 14.6.





The new earbuds feature a smaller design with no stem, much in line with what we&#x27;re expecting to be a similar design language for the second-generation AirPods Pro. In addition, according to code found within the latest iOS release candidate, the new Beats Studio Buds will feature Active Noise Cancellation, currently a feature exclusive to Apple&#x27;s ‌AirPods Pro‌ and AirPods Max. 





Today&#x27;s new FCC filings reveal nothing new about the design or the feature set of the upcoming earbuds; however, its filing indicates that a release should be imminent.

                    <span>Apple is intensely researching all aspects of car engineering and manufacturing, but there are growing questions around what form Apple&#x27;s vehicle project may take, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.





Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Peter Fintl, the director of technology and innovation for Capgemini Engineering Germany, explained that Apple&#x27;s movement in vehicle supply chains is noticeable.
We have seen enough echoes in the supply chain that we know Apple is really looking into every detail of car engineering and car manufacturing. But nobody knows if what Apple creates will be a car or a tech platform or a mobility service.
The report suggests that Apple&#x27;s car project may not actually culminate in a consumer-purchasable complete vehicle. Instead, Apple may …</span>

                    <span>Salvador Rodriguez, reporting for CNBC:
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on Friday said the social media company is
happy to pay Apple’s 30% commission rate on in-app transactions.
“We really feel like Snapchat wouldn’t exist without the iPhone
and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,” Spiegel
said on TechCheck. “In that sense, I’m not sure we have a choice
about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we’re happy to do it in
exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us
in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware
advancements.”
At first blush you might think this is lickspittle-ism. But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap.
But here’s thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. From Investopedia, citing Snap’s 10-K for 2020:
Substantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,
which accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in
revenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.
99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.
Find me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.

                    <span>I love this new ad from Apple. But given that I wrote this a few months ago, that’s probably not surprising. Funny, eye-opening, and true — that’s a good foundation for any ad.

This material was recorded at a secret gig in Amsterdam (back in 2016).

                    <span>I was talking to Jemma recently about what stops people
from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of
specific blog…</span>

Canada still haven’t won a game. 
 On the eve of day four of the IIHF World Championships, taking place in Riga, Latvia, the standings don’t look as many had predicted.
At the top of each group stands Russia in A and Germany in B, par for the course, especially considering the hockey talent Germany has produced in recent years. In particular, Lukas Reichel, a player we were personally high on, has stood out with five points in his first two games. 
However, Canada have not won a game yet (their goal differential sits at -6!) and the USA find themselves in 5th place at 1-1 with a +3 goal difference.

*The first round is going to be over fast; have you selected a bandwagon? A team from the Central Division, perhaps? [BSH]
*As more and more of these guys end up in the NHL, the one-stacked prospect corps will naturally thin out. Right now, who are the best of the bunch? [Inquirer]
*About those top prospects transitioning... Joel Farabee did that pretty nicely eh? We’re going to need him to get even better. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of getting better, we grade out this season’s bottom six forwards. [BSH]
*Kevin Hayes was playing injured this season. Which, frankly, seems obvious. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This weekend’s playoff action continued the excitement we’ve seen from this first round so far. Unfortunately, this weekend also brought us an incredibly scary moment for Leafs’ captain John Tavares. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*This weekend also brought a long suspension for Nazem Kadri. Which we are forced to compare to Tom Wilson. And then think about things. [Mile High Hockey]
*He’s appealing, though. [AP]
*And finally, another decision by the DoPS brings another round of calls for some kind of examination of the NHL’s discipline process. It just plain isn’t working. [The Athletic]</span>

How to start your journey, and where it is all headed
 Biomutant is a role-playing game where your experience tends to be differentiated more by character alignment rather than by their build of attributes and gear. The first two hours of Biomutant onboard the player to the world’s lore; its combat, crafting, and other systems; and then send them off on their first main mission. 
This Biomutant beginner’s guide will help you understand the game’s story, the ethos that informs the choices you have to make, and the initial choices themselves, so that you can shape your character and your story in a sensible way.

                    <span>Not quite Half-Life 3 confirmed, but it is to Victoria fans
 Victoria 3, a sequel so long-awaited by its fans the title has become a meme, is in development and coming soon. The grand strategy title was a keynote reveal of this weekend’s PDXCon, the annual gathering for all things Paradox Interactive.
Paradox’s Victoria series is a “society simulation” set in Great Britain during the time surrounding the industrial revolution. The most recent title was 2010’s Victoria 2 for PC. In the decade since, Victoria fans had beaten news or rumor of a sequel into a meme somewhat like the well-known Half-Life 3 meme. 
This weekend, the meme died. A Paradox Interactive community manager took to the official forums this weekend to start a meme contest for the game, posting this picture of game director Martin Anward (which Anward himself tweeted out on Friday.)

“Victoria 3 is instantly one of the most highly anticipated grand strategy games in Paradox’s history,” the company said in a statement, obliquely acknowledging its meme status. In the game, players take one of “dozens of nations,” not just the U.K., and lead it through a time of societal change, technological innovation, economic turmoil, and geopolitical rivalries.
Paradox’s news release did not say when Victoria 3 would launch, but did say it would be available for Windows PC via Steam, Xbox Game Pass for PC, and the Paradox Store.
As for the meme contest, I don’t know who won, but this was my personal favorite:

Final Fantasy Origin rumored for PS5, PC
 Nioh and Ninja Gaiden developer Team Ninja is developing a new Final Fantasy spinoff action game for Square Enix, according to a report from Fanbyte. That game, reportedly titled Final Fantasy Origin, is expected to be announced in June in conjunction with E3 2021. Square Enix is confirmed to appear at this year’s E3.
Fanbyte’s report follows a series of rumors regarding Final Fantasy Origin, which has been compared to FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The Final Fantasy spinoff is said to be “more accessible [than Nioh] for a wider audience” and set during the events of the first game in the franchise. Origin is reportedly bound for PlayStation 5, with a Windows PC version coming later.
Another component of the rumor surrounding Final Fantasy Origin is that Team Ninja will release a playable demo of the game this summer to solicit feedback from players. The studio similarly released “alpha” demos of Nioh and Nioh 2 ahead of each game’s final product.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. That game features two characters based on the original Final Fantasy, the Warrior of Light (pictured above) and Garland.
Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.</span>

There’s other stuff too, but the bear’s fun
 Crusader Kings 3’s first major expansion is coming soon, and it’s all about your seat of power. Royal Court allows medieval rulers to hang out in a 3D throne room, meet with their courtiers, and hire bards to sing epic tales. 
Royal Court fleshes out one of Crusader Kings 3’s most intriguing elements — managing your home base. Players have to deal with unruly vassals and rebellions, hold feasts, seduce lords, and ferret out secrets. Sometimes, the stories that take place in the player’s own royal hall are far more compelling than anything that happens over foreign borders.
Therefore, it makes sense that Royal Court turns your throne room into a much more tangible place that players can decorate, show off, and fill with fun entertainment like woodworkers or, uh, angry bears.
The Royal Court expansion will also introduce hybrid cultures and new ways for cultures to develop and diverge over the years, allowing rulers to make new ways of life for their kingdoms and empires. A previous, smaller scale expansion in March added winter weather and Norse invasions.
Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court will launch later in 2021.</span>

Raid charts are a universal language in Destiny, and key to taking on its hardest challenges
 Vault of Glass, the original Destiny raid, made its debut in Destiny 2 on Saturday. Bungie gave the old raid a new coat of paint, and many teams — including my own — dove in to conquer the challenge within the first 24 hours. But even though we all knew the fights from the original game, it didn’t stop me and a host of my peers from participating in my favorite Destiny raid-race experience: chart-making.
Destiny raids are like a cooperative puzzle. Players normally need to communicate information about something that only they can see to someone else who has to apply that information. Shouting “the thing to your left” doesn’t usually cut it, especially in a day-one scenario,…</span>

Meet Thunderbird
 Ubisoft is constantly updating Rainbow Six Siege, and a new Operator is coming to the game along with a slew of quality-of-life changes to the meta. Operation North Star is the next big update, and and the star is Mina “Thunderbird” Sky, an Indigenous Nakoda pilot with powerful healing tech.
Thunderbird carries a trio of deployable healing turrets known as the Kona Station.  She’s a flexible, fast Operator who can get around a defense site quickly to drop her Kona Stations. Players who enter a Kona Station’s radius are healed; the Station then goes on cooldown. Her weapon options include a Spear .308 and SPAS-15, as well as a backup Bearing-9 and Q-929.
Ubisoft is also reworking the Favela map, which is similar aesthetically but dramatically changed layout wise. The Operator Melusi is also getting a rework to make her less of a balance headache for players (her Banshee gadget can now be destroyed by a single bullet.) Operation North Star has tons of changes to make the game clearer and more fun, which are explained in detail on Ubisoft’s official site.
Operation North Star is live on Ubisoft’s test servers on May 25; it is slated to launch to all players in mid-June.</span>

                    <span>With the new Apple TV 4K now in customers&#x27; hands, some users are reporting issues when trying to control video with the redesigned Siri Remote. 





Specifically, some users are complaining that using the circular gesture on the new clickpad ring to fast-forward or rewind paused video isn&#x27;t working as expected. Rather than scrubbing through video continually in the direction of the gesture, the video scrubs back and forth in opposite directions.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

With no dog in the fight, it’s always fun to pick one.
 In the sleepiest days of the Flyers’ offseason, there’s not much to do in terms of leisure activities aside from watching baseball or playoff hockey. The latter might be a bit painful given the status of your favorite team, but fear not; we here at Broad Street Hockey are creating a brief, yet vaguely comprehensive guide to each division and the teams who you might choose to root for in their quest for the Cup. In the interest of hatred of rivals (a primary interest of any Flyers fan) the East division won’t be receiving this treatment, particularly because Philly fans are familiar with the teams included in that category.
Today’s overview will cover the Central division, aka my home turf. A…</span>

                    <span>Today is the one of the last days of the Epic Games v. Apple trial, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken the stand to ask questions levied by both Apple and Epic lawyers.





Cook&#x27;s testimony won&#x27;t be integral to the outcome of the trial, but what he has to say is of interest because this is the first time that he&#x27;s testified in a legal case, which highlights the serious nature of this dispute.



From the beginning, Cook established that he wasn&#x27;t deeply involved with the App Store. He said that he …</span>

While the Apple employees dodged many of the questions asked in the interview, they did reveal that the new 11-inch iPad Pro&#x27;s lack of a Liquid Retina XDR display is at least partly due to weight considerations.

                    <span>You’re not imagining things
 After a rough few weeks of bugs for Destiny 2’s new Season of the Splicer, Bungie revealed another pain point: Seasonal Challenge XP wasn’t working properly last season.
Since Season of the Chosen ended and Season of the Splicer began, players have complained about earning less XP from Seasonal Challenges (a new, weekly Challenge system that offers big XP gains for playing Destiny 2’s various activities). Turns out that the XP gain is a bug, but not in the way you might expect. …</span>

Pick up three weapons and some boots
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:

The best parts of Resident Evil Village have little to do with Resident Evil
 The official title of the eighth mainline Resident Evil game, recently released to fawning praise, is Resident Evil Village. Its creators opted to ditch the established numerical naming for the more evocative and stand-alone “Village,” but frankly, they haven’t given a strong justification for the decision.
Having now played the game, I believe I’ve uncovered why this small verbiage tweak marks a grand reimagining …</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, looking over the Hangar on a staircase.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:

A couple of young defensemen had the opportunity to step up, but they instead fell back.
 Earlier this week, Drew took a look at the netminders and graded their seasons in the first part of our 2021 player grades. Today we’ll be looking at the defense, and, like the goaltenders, there aren’t many positives here.
We’ll only be looking at defensemen that appeared in at least ten games this season, but know that in my heart I gave Cam York an “A” for his thr…</span>

 Necromunda: Hired Gun takes place in the Warhammer 40K universe, but it’s far removed from the central high stakes wars of the setting. Instead, you hangout in the criminal hub city of a Necromunda hive city as a bounty hunter, looking for contracts. You also have a dog, so that’s nice.

This mod allows her to face off against Lady Maria of the Clocktower in a best of three combat.

It’s like Goat Simulator, but for boomers
 Just Die Already is a new game from the designers of Goat Simulator, and it’s a similarly wacky sandbox experience. Players take control of an older person who’s been kicked out of their retirement home, and they’re now on the streets. That’s a pretty depressing game premise, but when you look at the concept in action, it’s all about going wild.

The lottery odds for the 2021 NHL Draft have been released, and, well, the Philadelphia Flyers are there.
 As the Philadelphia Flyers are sitting on the outside of the postseason, there is at least one thing to look forward too — an event we did not see ourselves paying attention to 12 months ago. That’s right, it’s the draft lottery.

 The playoffs are underway and the Flyers are golfing, so the gang goes in on the newest rumors of Nolan Patrick’s dissatisfaction, what makes fun hockey, and which of two moot-shot UFA candidates we’d choose over the other.</span>

A look at where the stats and the eyes agree or disagree.
 Whether it’s wide-scale team evaluation or at the player level, hockey analytics have really begun to claim their stake in the game over the last decade. Teams are continuously growing more accustomed to the use of data, and are willing to use any and all information available to them. The hockey analytics wars are long gone, even if the egg in your Twitter mentions suggests otherwise; they’re here…</span>

Get ready for some new scares
 Phasmophobia, the ghost-hunting game best played with friends, has an update on the way with two new ghosts. The developer of Phasmophobia, Kinetic Games, maintains a public Trello board with known issues, future features, and more. Fans have noticed two tantalizing cards on the board, features that are due to ship with the next beta patch: two new ghost types named Yokai and Hantu.

The next Dark Pictures Anthology game is getting closer
 Supermassive Games is getting ready to unveil the next game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, House of Ashes. A new teaser trailer gives us a hint of the story, showing soldiers being stalked by some kind of mysterious creature.

The full statement from Chuck Fletcher is as follows:

The feature will even work in VR
 No Man’s Sky players will soon be able to explore the vast reaches of outer space at a smooth frame rate all the way up to 4K resolution, as support for Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology is coming to the game this month, Nvidia and developer Hello Games announced on Tuesday. 
DLSS is a feature exclusive to certain Nvidia graphics cards that aims to bring improved performance and image quality to games. The process takes lowe…</span>

Movie heroes John McClane and John Rambo are the stars of the midseason patch
 Call of Duty’s midseason update is all about action movies and the heroes that make them great. In the first trailer for the Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War ’80s Action Movie update, we got our first glimpse of John McClane and John Rambo in action. 
The trailer itself is styled like a trailer for an ’80s action movie might be. It’s got a cheesy voice-over, lots of film grain, and …</span>

Wait, forget Ethan, what’s up with that Heisenberg line?
 Resident Evil Village is a thrill ride of a game, taking players through a series of rich environments and battles with distinct, memorable bosses. There’s a lot of detail to pick apart and examine in the game, but I’m stuck on one question: Why does Karl Heisenberg, a Lord of a highly cursed Romanian village, know that Chris Redfield punched a boulder while inside an active volcano one time?

 Dominion, a modern classic among tabletop games, is getting a new digital app. The collaboration between publisher Rio Grande Games and developer Temple Gates Games will be the first to apply an advanced artificial intelligence to the game, one that has been trained on a neural network. Developers say this new approach, designed in partnership with AI researcher Keldon Jones, is so adaptive that the AI is c…</span>

Roblox no longer uses the term “game” on its platform
 Roblox, a massively popular platform where people go to play and make video games, no longer wants the public to think of it as a platform where people go to play and make video games. As Roblox now tells it, it’s a place to go and enjoy experiences. 
Why does this matter? It all has to do with the ongoing Epic Games’ vs. Apple Computer trial, where the game developer and publisher is suing Apple for allegedly stifling competition…</span>

Six-month ban is for not cooperating with Riot’s investigation
 Valorant developer Riot Games has suspended Jay “sinatraa” Won for six months for his failure to cooperate with a sexual assault investigation. The former Overwatch pro player will also have to complete “professional conduct training,” Riot said in an announcement Monday. The investigation has been turned over to law enforcement, Riot said.
In March, a former partner accused Won of sexual assau…</span>
