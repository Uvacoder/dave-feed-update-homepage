 As the Philadelphia Flyers are sitting on the outside of the postseason, there is at least one thing to look forward too — an event we did not see ourselves paying attention to 12 months ago. That’s right, it’s the draft lottery.

A look at where the stats and the eyes agree or disagree.
 Whether it’s wide-scale team evaluation or at the player level, hockey analytics have really begun to claim their stake in the game over the last decade. Teams are continuously growing more accustomed to the use of data, and are willing to use any and all information available to them. The hockey analytics wars are long gone, even if the egg in your Twitter mentions suggests otherwise; they’re here…</span>

The Riiswalker and Archon’s Thunder aren’t dropping as intended
 Destiny 2’s monthly PvP spectacular, Iron Banner, made its debut in the Season of the Splicer on Tuesday. This time around, Iron Banner vendor Lord Saladin brought with him several weapons: two reprised Iron Banner guns from past seasons, and two brand-new weapons, the Riiswalker shotgun and the Archon’s Thunder machine gun.

Junkfood Junkrat is truly terrifying
 Overwatch’s annual Anniversary event, celebrating the fifth year of Blizzard’s hero shooter, goes live today, May 18, and runs through June 8. The event brings back all of Overwatch’s seasonal events (Winter Wonderland, Halloween Terror, Summer Games, Archives, and Lunar New Year brawls), and it comes with a fresh batch of skins. You know the drill by this point!
For Overwatch Anniversary 2021, heroes and villains including Baptist…</span>

The midseason update also includes new guns, multiplayer maps, and game modes
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s ’80s Action Hero update is almost here, and  Treyarch has finally revealed what exactly it’s going to include. The season 3 midseason patch will add two of cinema’s most famous action stars to the game, along with some iconic locations from their movies to the Warzone map. The update will also include all of the previously announced features …</span>

Movie heroes John McClane and John Rambo are the stars of the midseason patch
 Call of Duty’s midseason update is all about action movies and the heroes that make them great. In the first trailer for the Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War ’80s Action Movie update, we got our first glimpse of John McClane and John Rambo in action. 
The trailer itself is styled like a trailer for an ’80s action movie might be. It’s got a cheesy voice-over, lots of film grain, and …</span>

Wait, forget Ethan, what’s up with that Heisenberg line?
 Resident Evil Village is a thrill ride of a game, taking players through a series of rich environments and battles with distinct, memorable bosses. There’s a lot of detail to pick apart and examine in the game, but I’m stuck on one question: Why does Karl Heisenberg, a Lord of a highly cursed Romanian village, know that Chris Redfield punched a boulder while inside an active volcano one time?

Six-month ban is for not cooperating with Riot’s investigation
 Valorant developer Riot Games has suspended Jay “sinatraa” Won for six months for his failure to cooperate with a sexual assault investigation. The former Overwatch pro player will also have to complete “professional conduct training,” Riot said in an announcement Monday. The investigation has been turned over to law enforcement, Riot said.

We started an heptalogy (seven album concept) back in 1996 and now, with « Eternal Life » we’re ending it. And I think we don’t stop with a slower stupidly sounding doom album. We tried to end with the most bestail thing we could…</span>

                    <span>Just few days ago I heard that Hungarian barbarians SxOxTxEx splitted up… That damn sad news, but that shit pushed me to write this review. So I want to dedicate this small write up too these crazy fuckers! Oridginaly this material was released in the US in 10″, but I will cover the UE version, which was pressed in 12″ format. Heinous didn&#x60;t changed their artwork for it, but SxOxTxEx did. Must say this new art is way better than old one. But let&#x60;s be shorter and put this record on!

It’s prediction time (part two)!
 And we’re back with more predictions! We tackled the East and West divisions earlier, and now we’re back to see who our staff likes to win their first round series in the North and Central. Let’s get into it!
Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Montreal Canadiens

It’s prediction time!
 It’s that time of year again, folks! The playoffs are upon us, and you know what that means: it’s time for us to make our predictions and hope that none of the teams do anything crazy and make us look dumb. 
Washington Capitals vs. Boston Bruins

Maddie: This is a weird one. The Capitals kind of seem like the favorite here, but I also keep looking at the Bruins and thinking “man, I don’t know, I think they’re finally hitting that dow…</span>

                    <span>Walking, cities, Paris, and YouTube are four of my favorite things, so this 5.5-hour, 12-mile video walking tour of Paris is right up my alley. Along the way, they visit the Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, the market on Rue Mouffetard, the Jardins du Luxembourg, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and lots more. If you turn the closed captions on, you can read about the histories of the places as the walk progresses. Hopefully this will tide me over until I can visit again. (via open culture)

                    <span>For the past several years, Annette LeMay Burke has been traveling the American West in search of disguised cell phone towers, collected in a project she calls Fauxliage.
As disguised cell phone towers proliferate, I find it ironic that instead of providing camouflage, their disguises actually unmask their true identities. The towers have an array of creative concealments. They often impersonate trees such as evergreens, palms, and saguaros. Some pillars serve other uses such as flagpoles or iconographic ch…</span>

This theory states, that you can not measure two separate parameters of a particle simultaneously. You can either determine one parameter and ignore the other or vice versa, but you can never know everything at once.

Ever since reading his excellent The Island at the Center of the World, Russell Shorto has been one of those writers. His latest piece, The Woman Who Made van Gogh, tells the story of Jo van Gogh-Bonger who, after both her husband Theo and her brother-in-law Vincent died within a year and a half of each other, worked tirelessly for decades to get Vincent’s work out into the world.

This expansion means that there is a cosmological horizon around us. Everything beyond it, is traveling faster, relative to us, than the speed of light.

                    <span>Interesting piece at Apple’s Newsroom, headlined: “App Store Stopped More Than $1.5 Billion in Potentially Fraudulent Transactions in 2020”:
It takes significant resources behind the scenes to ensure these
bad actors can’t exploit users’ most sensitive information, from
location to payment details. While it’s impossible to catch every
act of fraud or ill intent before it happens, thanks to Apple’s
industry-leading antifraud efforts, security experts agree the App

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.

When the once burgeoning coal industry in Ruhrgebiet, Germany, began to decline, many of the workers’ apartments were sold off. Oftentimes, new owners only purchased half of the building — miners maintained a lifelong right of residence to their quarters — creating a stark split between the left and right sides of the structure.

                    <span>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge last week:
Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big
cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The
software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12
percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and
entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its
Microsoft Store. […]
These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games
in Microsoft’s store. While Microsoft hasn’t explained why it’…</span>

In general, I have considered the case of Mr. Trump to be much
less complex than people seem to think. And it has been made
to appear highly complicated by big tech companies like
Facebook because they want to exhaust us all in a noisy and
intractable debate.
Mr. Trump should be seen as an outlier — a lone, longtime rule

until he wandered into seditious territory. He’s an unrepentant

                    <span>Apple likes to claim that the App Store replaced the system of selling software in physical boxes in stores and over the mail.
But it’s not true.
My experience selling apps before the App Store was not unique or new — it’s only interesting now because people may have forgotten this history, and younger people may never have heard it.
Here’s my story:
We shipped NetNewsWire 1.0, an RSS reader for Mac OS X, in 2003 and sold it over the web for $39.95. There were no boxes and no printed manuals — there was not…</span>

Sleep benefits or not, I do find it more comfortable. Perhaps
BYU’s results differ from previous studies because Night Shift

I’ve long heard from friends and readers who enjoy Night Shift (and f.lux) simply because they feel it reduces eye strain. Comfort is comfort — if you think Night Shift feels easier on your eyes, go ahead and use it. …</span>

Tuesday, Nasdaq Inc. temporarily suspended broadcasting prices for

the best of Nuzzel should be expressed in 2021. There may be
elements of Nuzzel that also belong in the Twitter app or that can

People come to Twitter to talk about what’s happening, and
sometimes conversations about things we care about can get intense
and people say things in the moment they might regret later.
That’s why in 2020, we tested
prompts
that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially
harmful or offensive reply before they hit send.

I think they got the top 3 exactly right, and the top 10 is pretty close.

Ice makes similar sounds under other conditions, like if you skip rocks on a frozen lake:

                    <span>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:
Facebook’s Oversight Board, which acts as a quasi-court to deliberate the company’s content decisions, said the social network was right to bar Mr. Trump after he used the site to foment an insurrection in Washington in January. The panel said the ongoing risk of violence “justified” the suspension. But the board also said that Facebook’s penalty of an indefinite suspension was “not appropriate,” and that the company should apply a “defined penalty.” The board g…</span>

Until recently, claims of better sleep due to Night Shift have
been theoretical. However, a new study from BYU published in
Sleep Health challenges the premise made by phone manufacturers
and found that the Night Shift functionality does not actually
improve sleep.
To test the theory, BYU psychology professor Chad Jensen and

                    <span>Longtime readers know I have a thing for good iPhone weather apps. I find weather apps to be an evergreen playground for design ideas — and that’s more true than ever now with iOS 14 widgets. One of my very favorites in recent years is Hello Weather. It’s attractive, original, and highly useful. (Good iPad support too.) Free to download and use, but they’ve got a Pro tier that unlocks even more, like Apple Watch complications and additional data sources. No ads, and their privacy nutrition label simply stat…</span>

Roku is alleging that Google is using the YouTube TV negotiations
to push it to enforce hardware requirements for future Roku
products that could make Roku devices more expensive. This
allegation bears some extra weight because of Google’s own
Chromecast TV streaming device, which is currently selling for $20
more than the cheapest Roku streamer. […]

Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza
cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to
minuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the
public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from
spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in
much the same way as SARS-CoV-2, but they are less effective at
jumping from host to host.

There is no government data yet on whether health authorities’
