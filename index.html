Until it can’t, that is. See also Steven Strogatz’s explanation of Hilbert’s infinite hotel and how Georg Cantor’s discovery of different types of infinities complicated the hotel’s hospitality.

                    <span>Walking, cities, Paris, and YouTube are four of my favorite things, so this 5.5-hour, 12-mile video walking tour of Paris is right up my alley. Along the way, they visit the Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, the market on Rue Mouffetard, the Jardins du Luxembourg, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and lots more. If you turn the closed captions on, you can read about the histories of the places as the walk progresses. Hopefully this will tide me over until I can visit again. (via open culture)

                    <span>For the past several years, Annette LeMay Burke has been traveling the American West in search of disguised cell phone towers, collected in a project she calls Fauxliage.
As disguised cell phone towers proliferate, I find it ironic that instead of providing camouflage, their disguises actually unmask their true identities. The towers have an array of creative concealments. They often impersonate trees such as evergreens, palms, and saguaros. Some pillars serve other uses such as flagpoles or iconographic ch…</span>

The sculptures of the Heisenberg Series are based on Werner Heisenberg’s famous Uncertainty Principle. This theory states, that you can not measure two separate parameters of a particle simultaneously. You can either determine one parameter and ignore the other or vice versa, but you can never know everything at once.

Titled “The Sky’s the Limit,” it begins by declaring that “solar and wind potential is far higher than that of fossil fuels and can meet global energy demand many times over.” Taken by itself, that’s not a very bold claim: scientists have long noted that the sun directs more energy to the Earth in an hour than humans use in a year.

This expansion means that there is a cosmological horizon around us. Everything beyond it, is traveling faster, relative to us, than the speed of light.

Last week, Apple introduced a new ad unit to the App Store: a paid placement on its Search page. Rumors of this new unit had circulated previously, although the notion that Apple would increase the density of ad placements in the App Store was wholly predictable, as I assert in this piece and this piece.

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.

When the once burgeoning coal industry in Ruhrgebiet, Germany, began to decline, many of the workers’ apartments were sold off. Oftentimes, new owners only purchased half of the building — miners maintained a lifelong right of residence to their quarters — creating a stark split between the left and right sides of the structure.

Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big
cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The
software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12
percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and
entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its
Microsoft Store. […]
These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games

In general, I have considered the case of Mr. Trump to be much

to appear highly complicated by big tech companies like
Facebook because they want to exhaust us all in a noisy and
intractable debate.
Mr. Trump should be seen as an outlier — a lone, longtime rule

shifts the colors much less than f.lux or blue light glasses.
I’ve long heard from friends and readers who enjoy Night Shift (and f.lux) simply because they feel it reduces eye strain. Comfort is comfort — if you think Night Shift feels easier on your eyes, go ahead and use it. …</span>

                    <span>Anita Butler and Alberto Parrella, writing on Twitter’s product blog:
People come to Twitter to talk about what’s happening, and
sometimes conversations about things we care about can get intense
and people say things in the moment they might regret later.
That’s why in 2020, we tested
prompts
that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially
harmful or offensive reply before they hit send.
Based on feedback and learnings from those tests, we’ve made
improvements to the systems that decide when a…</span>

                    <span>No one is going to agree completely with any such list, but man, this one comes really close to being hard to argue with. I think they got the top 3 exactly right, and the top 10 is pretty close. (I’ll quibble most with The Larry Sanders Show at #10 — I’d have rated it in the top 5, no question — but my profoundly deep affection for that show probably biases me.)

Ice makes similar sounds under other conditions, like if you skip rocks on a frozen lake:

                    <span>New iOS app from the keen minds at Lickability: a deceptively simple utility for keeping score of tabletop games. Lots to love: AirPlay support (so you can show the score on a TV), $5 pay-once-and-you’re-done pricing, a “no data collected” privacy nutrition label, and the app weighs only 5.5 MB.

The basic idea is evergreen, and is in no way specific to Apple. Smaller companies make products that build upon, or fill gaps within, platforms from larger companies. The best of those ideas — ideas that truly would be better “built in”, eventually do get built in. The small innovators need to…</span>

What are they thinking, these vaccine-hesitant, vaccine-resistant,

I was staunchly

                    <span>Janko Roettgers, reporting for Protocol:
Roku is alleging that Google is using the YouTube TV negotiations
to push it to enforce hardware requirements for future Roku
products that could make Roku devices more expensive. This
allegation bears some extra weight because of Google’s own
Chromecast TV streaming device, which is currently selling for $20
more than the cheapest Roku streamer. […]
Roku also alleges that Google aims to dictate how the streaming
device maker treats voice search results. According to…</span>

Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza
cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to
minuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the
public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from
spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in
much the same way as SARS-CoV-2, but they are less effective at
jumping from host to host.
As Scientific American reported last fall, the drop-off in…</span>

There is no government data yet on whether health authorities’
10-day halt in administration of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine
soured people on the product, and the company declined to discuss
the matter. But in spot checks across the country, people seeking
vaccines and officials dispensing them appear eager to resume
using the vaccine, which is also easier to store and transport.
