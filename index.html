                    <span>Apple today announced plans to make several changes to the App Store in order to settle a class-action lawsuit that was brought against Apple by developers in the United States.





Under the terms of the deal, Apple will let developers use communication methods like email to tell customers about payment methods available outside of iOS apps, and it will expand the price points that developers can offer for apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Apple also plans to create a $100 million &quot;fund&quot; for small developers as part of the settlement, and it will release annual transparency reports on the app review process.



Apple says that the settlement will make the ‌App Store‌ an &quot;even better business opportunity for developers&quot; while maintaining the safety of the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>Samsung earlier this month unveiled the new Galaxy Z Fold 3, its latest flagship foldable smartphone. We thought we&#x27;d check out the Z Fold 3 to see the technology improvements that Samsung has made to its foldable smartphone lineup.

Foldable smartphones are still expensive, and as a Samsung flagship, the Z Fold 3 is priced starting at $1,799.99, which is more than you have to shell out for some computers. Of course, this is meant to serve as both a phone and a tablet, so there&#x27;s a little more versatility than your average smartphone.





Design wise, the Z Fold 3 is Samsung&#x27;s best foldable device yet because the camera is under the display for an all-display design. It looks great and while it&#x27;s not entirely hid…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile recently suffered a significant data breach that saw sensitive data from more than 50 million current, prospective, and former customers stolen.





John Binns, a 21-year-old American who lives in Turkey, told The Wall Street Journal that he is responsible for the attack. Binns said that he discovered an unprotected router in July after scanning T-Mobile&#x27;s known internet addresses for weak spots.



He used the unprotected router to access T-Mobile&#x27;s data center located in Washington, where stored credentials provided him access to over 100 servers. He said he initially panicked because he &quot;had access to something big,&quot; and went on to claim that T-Mobile&#x27;s &quot;security is awful.&quot;

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The refreshed firmware has a version number of 1.0.291 and a build number of 1A291a, up from 1A287b.





There&#x27;s no word on what new features the firmware might add, but firmware released back in June added anti-stalking enhancements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌iPhone‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Classic puzzle game Myst has been revived on the Mac and an optimized version of the title is now available for M1 Macs.





Cyan has undertaken a rework of the game that takes advantage of Metal 2.1 and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution for a 50 percent performance boost on ‌M1‌ Macs that does not impact game quality.



Myst for ‌M1‌ Macs features improved modeling, textures, and dynamic lighting effects, and Apple&#x27;s machines are able to run the game at 4K resolution without noisy fans. It&#x27;s also been reimagined for a VR gaming experience.



Myst is compatible with both Intel and ‌M1‌ Macs. According to the system requirements, it works with the following machines:



 	
All MacBook Pros released since 2018


 	
All iMacs released since 2019


 	
All iMac Pros released since 2017


 	
All MacBook Airs released since 2018


 	
All Mac Pros released since 2019


 	
All Mac minis released since 2018




The updated version of Myst can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $29.99.

                    <span>Netflix earlier this year confirmed plans to get into mobile gaming, and now the company is testing its gaming experience with Netflix users in Poland.





Netflix&#x27;s Polish Twitter account today tweeted that the Android Netflix app in Poland is offering access to &quot;Stranger Things 1984&quot; and &quot;Stranger Things 3,&quot; two mobile game options.



According to NetflixGeeked, the games are included with a Netflix membership and feature no ads or in-app purchases, similar to how Apple Arcade works. The games are downloaded directly to a mobile device from Netflix and are not streamed from the Netflix app. 



As noted by CNET, the games that are being offered have been available for a few years outside of the Netflix app and were created in partnership with Netflix for the second and third seasons of &quot;Stranger Things.&quot;



Back in July, Netflix said that it considered gaming to be another new content category, similar to its expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted television.



With its expansion into mobile gaming, Netflix will compete directly with ‌Apple Arcade‌, Apple&#x27;s $4.99 per month gaming service that allows users to access hundreds of ad-free games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.



Given that the two games Netflix is experimenting with are already existing titles, we may need to wait for some time to see where Netflix plans to take its mobile gaming feature in the future.

                    <span>The Apple Watch continues to be the most popular smart watch on the market, and in Q2 2021, Apple hit a new user base milestone, according to Counterpoint Research&#x27;s Global Smartwatch Shipments Tracker.





There are now more than 100 million active Apple Watch users thanks to the device&#x27;s design, health features, and related services. It&#x27;s possible Apple hit this milestone even earlier than 2021, as Neil Cybart said in February that based on his estimates, Apple reached 100 million users in December.



In the second quarter of 2021, global smart watch shipments were up 27 percent overall, and Apple was able to maintain its number one position. Apple&#x27;s market share was at 28 percent, down slightly from 30 percent in the year-ago quarter, but well above competitors like Huawei, Samsung, and Garmin.



The United States continues to be Apple&#x27;s largest market, responsible for more than half of the Apple Watch user base.



During the quarter, the Apple Watch Series 6 was the most popular smart watch overall, followed by the Apple Watch SE. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 took the third spot, followed by the Apple Watch Series 3 in fourth and the Imoo Z6-4G in fifth.





Apple in just a few weeks is set to debut its newest wrist-worn device, the Apple Watch Series 7. The Series 7 will feature the first redesign we&#x27;ve seen in years, with Apple adopting a flat-edged design, a larger display, and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.



We&#x27;re expecting Apple to debut the new Apple Watch Series 7 models alongside the iPhone 13 lineup, and we could be hearing details on an event date within the next two weeks.

                    <span>Refurbished M1 Mac mini models with a 10Gb ethernet port are now available from the Apple Store, following the launch of the $100 build-to-order option in April.





The refurbished units were first spotted by Paul Haddad on Twitter. There are currently a range of refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ configurations with 10Gb ethernet available with different amounts of storage, although stock appears to be selling out quickly. Going forward, stock will fluctuate based on which machines customers are sending back to Apple for repairs and returns.



Spot checks show that the refurbished ‌M1‌ models with 10Gb ethernet are now available in multiple regions, including the United States, Canada, France, and Japan.



When buying the ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ new, customers have to use a build-to-order configuration to upgrade from standard Gigabit ethernet to 10Gb ethernet for an additional $100. A refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and 10Gb ethernet sells for $849, which is a $150 saving on the same machine if bought new.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌‌M1‌‌ Mac minis are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌‌Mac mini‌, and they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

                    <span>Days after celebrating his tenth anniversary at Apple&#x27;s helm, Tim Cook is poised to receive a whopping $750 million of Apple&#x27;s stock this week as the final installment of his pay deal with Apple, put in place over a decade ago when he took over the company, Bloomberg reports.





The installment will consist of 5 million shares of Apple&#x27;s stock, equating to be around worth $750 million, according to Bloomberg. Last year, Cook received restricted stock units worth up to $114 million, ensuring he&#x27;ll remain CEO until at least 2025.



Cook, aged 60, has a net worth of roughly $1.5 billion according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Billionaires Index. Though a billionaire, Cook&#x27;s compensation for 2020 was among the most modest compared to other high-paid tech CEOs. In 2020, Cook received $14.7 million, according to SEC filings. 



The CEO has said in the past he donates a portion of his salary and compensation to charitable organizations and plans to give most of his wealth away.

                    <span>Some Apple staff feel more confident to speak about their employer amongst themselves, to the press, and on social media due to the company&#x27;s switch to remote working and increased use of Slack over the past year, The Information reports.





Apple&#x27;s Slack became a &quot;virtual town square&quot; at the company, providing a platform for employees to protest the return to in-person work, decisions to hire controversial new employees, and more. Until the transition to remote working last year due to the global health crisis, Apple&#x27;s culture of secrecy limited the opportunities for grassroots employees to organize independently.



Apple employees are asked to sign multiple agreements vowing to not disclose information about their work, including to spouses and other colleagues at the compan…</span>

                    <span>An image purporting to show a &quot;45mm&quot; Apple Watch band has surfaced online ahead of the expected unveiling of Apple Watch Series 7 models next month.





The small, low-resolution image, shared by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, originated from the Chinese social media network Weibo and appears to show the underside of an Apple Watch band, which could be a Saddle Brown Leather Link band. While it is not clear how reliable this image may be, the 45mm sizing lines up with a number of previous rumors around the Apple Watch Series 7.



Alleged CAD renders of the larger Apple Watch Series 7 suggested that it would sport a 45mm display, a 1mm increase from the current 44mm display on the larger Apple Watch Series 6 model. This is expected to be achieved by making the casing&#x27;s edges flat, which …</span>

                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is rushing to hire 200,000 more workers by the end of September to manufacture the iPhone 13 models, according to the South China Morning Post.





The 200,000 additional workers are needed at the world&#x27;s biggest iPhone factory in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, ahead of the expected launch of the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup next month. Hiring enough manpower has been the &quot;biggest bottleneck&quot; to production at the manufacturing facility, according to the site&#x27;s deputy general manager, Wang Xue, who was quoted by a local broadcaster. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn was struggling to hire enough workers for ‌iPhone 13‌ production.



The staffing goal is reportedly being supported by local governments, which have provided 100 busses to &quot;pick up job applicants from their communities and drop them at the factory gates.&quot; Foxconn believes that it will be able to hire 200,000 new hires by the end of September &quot;at the current speed of recruitment.&quot; Once hired, new workers will be fast-tracked into their position. 



The Zhengzhou factory can accommodate as many as 350,000 assembly line workers and manufacture up to 500,000 new iPhones every day. The current hiring push seeks to combat ramped-up production for the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.

                    <span>A photo purporting to show the sticker tabs used to seal Apple products in their boxes appears to confirm the &quot;iPhone 13&quot; name for the company&#x27;s upcoming 2021 iPhone lineup.





The photo was highlighted by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, linking to a post on the Chinese social media network Weibo.



The validity of the image is not known, but it is not unusual to see images of ‌iPhone‌ packaging emerging at this time of year as the device&#x27;s launch date approaches. Around three weeks before the launch of the iPhone 12 lineup last year, images of packaging stickers showing the correct naming for those devices were also shared by DuanRui.



While most reliable sources have persistently referred to the 2021 ‌iPhone‌ models as the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌&quot; lineup, there has been a large amount of speculation from some observers on social media and a number of individuals who claim to be leakers with no track record that the upcoming iPhones would in fact be &quot;‌iPhone‌ 12S&quot; models.



A survey from earlier this year suggested that most consumers do not want the devices to be called the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌.&quot; 38 percent of survey respondents said that Apple should call its next smartphone series simply &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ (2021),&quot; 26 percent thought that the &quot;‌‌iPhone 13‌‌&quot; was the best name, and only 13 percent said that they would like to see the devices called the &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12S.&quot;



The ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is expected to be unveiled next month with a number of new features, including a 120Hz display, larger batteries, new camera features, an &quot;A15&quot; chip, up to 1TB of storage, and more.

In which the gang talks way too much about Derick Brassard
 Development camp kicks off this week which means the season draws ever closer, and the gang has some thoughts about Chuck’s latest signing, Travis Sanheim’s new contract, and the Flyers’ overall cap situation moving forward. Which leads to an important question: why isn’t this team better?</span>

Set to be an unrestricted free agent this summer, Coots is staying in Philadelphia for a while.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to be at the center of the NHL offseason.
Announced by the team on Thursday afternoon, they have signed top center Sean Couturier to an eight-year, $62-million ($7.75-million AAV) contract. Keeping him with the Flyers through the 2029-2030 season.

With just one year remaining on his sweetheart of a deal signed all the way back in 2015, the Flyers were facing a tough decision if no extension was signed before the season-opener. Wading through different team expectations, Couturier is easily one …</span>

It happens to the best of us.
 This season was a challenging one for the Flyers in a number of departments, that’s no secret. Between the pandemic related struggles and the team’s own underperformance of expectations, the picture wasn’t pretty. It was a difficult mix for everyone, but particularly for young players like Connor Bunnaman, who were left to deal with all of that, and also had to add into the mix the challenge of finding their footing and continuing to get adjusted to playing at the NHL level in the first place. 



After putting in some good work with the Phantoms during the 2019-20 season, Bunnaman was given a well deserved call-up to the Flyers, and a chance to showcase a bit more of the positives of his game. He was certainly abl…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers’ options at center remained the one lingering question as we head into the start of the preseason festivities, so Chuck went ahead and filled in that hole a little bit with another bottom-6 C option for Alain Vigneault to consider. [BSH]
*Vigneault has some history with the new hire too, which might make his decision easier. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Charlie breaks down the signing, as only Charlie can. [The Athletic]
*Speaking of contracts, it’s a contract season for Sean Couturier, arguably the Flyers’ most important player at the moment. So it’s going to be a big season. Big big season. [The Athletic]
*Our last-season reviews continue with everyone’s favorite youth, Joel Farabee... [BSH]
*... and also everyone’s favorite bottom-sixer, Scott Laughton. [BSH]
*As folks begin to preview the season, a look around the Metro suggests that Chuck’s offseason moves weren’t enough — on their own — to make people believe in the Flyers again. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Noted hilarious writer known as DGB has put together fictitious NHL rosters based on some wackadoo parameters in the past, but this one might be the wackadooiest of them all.  Which of course is why it is so fun. [The Athletic]
*And finally, Flyers Aquaman, dream or nightmare? [BSH]</span>

This is April’s second big announcement out of Gamescom
 Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl’s cast is growing by two ... or maybe three? April O’Neil and CatDog are both coming to Nickelodeon’s upcoming fighting game, developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs announced on Thursday at Gamescom 2021.
April is the beloved friend to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — several of which are also coming to All-Star Brawl. Based on her trailer, April’s in-game moves will lean into her role as a TV reporter, using her camera as a weapon in some of her attacks, while other will have her deploy a few of the turtles’ weapons as well. 
Weirdly, this is the second game that April has been announced as a playable character in at Gamescom 2021 so far, after she was announced as part of the cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge on Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, CatDog fits right at home in All-Star Brawl’s list of fan-favorite characters from old NickToons. CatDog looks fittingly strange in-game and seems to have a move set that takes advantage of both ... halves of their body. It seems like players might even get unique moves depending on which direction CatDog is facing, since Cat and Dog may do slightly different things. 
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is set to be released on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X later this year.</span>

The Destiny Timeline is a godsend for players trying to get into Destiny
 Destiny 2’s new Season of the Lost offers the biggest patch of the year. Some of those major changes are large, like a suite of new seasonal activities, weapons, and Exotics. But one of my favorite changes is so small that you might miss it entirely: the Timeline.
Billed in the patch notes for Season of the Lost as a way for players to see what expansions and seasons they own — and purchase any outliers, if they desire — the Timeline is much more than a store. It’s a visual representation of everything that’s happened in Destiny 2 since it launched in 2017. And for new players, it’s a great place to learn what the hell is going on with the baseline story before watching your way int…</span>

Stasis won’t be the only Darkness power forever
 Bungie hasn’t been shy about calling Destiny 2: Beyond Light’s Stasis subclass the “first” new Darkness power set. So Guardians may have been surprised during Tuesday’s Destiny Showcase when Bungie didn’t reveal a new element. In an interview for Twitch’s The Weekly show, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that players won’t see a new powerset in The Witch Queen expansion. But he also revealed that one is in development for a future update.
“We knew when we wanted to add another damage type to Destiny, we needed to take more time,” said Blackburn. “We’re not doing a new damage sub-type for Witch Queen. We have one in development, you’re gonna see it eventually, but we really want to make sure we get it right.”
Blackburn went on to speak about the Light subclass rework, which will use the Stasis system added to the game in Beyond Light. The creative director talked up the new reworks for these Light subclasses, suggesting that longtime players will have a lot more tools and combinations to play with. 
It’s currently unclear what the fifth subclass type will be in Destiny 2 — or when players will get their hands on it. But it seems likely that players will have three Light and three Darkness subclasses by the time Destiny 2’s first saga — the battle between Light and Dark — ends with The Final Shape expansion in 2024.</span>

Welcome to Malevento
 Overwatch is primarily a team-based game, but occasionally you prefer something a little less cooperative and a little more aggressive. That’s where the free-for-all deathmatch mode comes in. Eight players battle it out on a map in a frantic race to 20 kills. For fans of this game mode, a new map is coming. Malevento will be the next free-for-all deathmatch map, and it’s coming to the game’s Public Test Region (PTR) on Windows PC today.
Malevento is a Talon base located in Italy, so it’ll likely have a few Easter eggs and lore hints for sharp-eyed fans. This is only the fourth map that is designed specifically for Deathmatch.

 Blizzard Entertainment says it will rename McCree, Overwatch’s outlaw bounty hunter, after his real-life namesake, former game designer Jesse McCree, was let go from the studio in the wake of a sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit filed against publisher Activision Blizzard.
“We believe it’s necessary to change the name of the hero currently known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for,” Blizzard’s Overwatch team said in a statement posted Thursday to Twitter announcing the name change.

It’ll be the first Skate game on Windows
 Skate fans with a PC, breathe easy. The newest Skate game — which everyone is calling Skate 4, at least until its actual title is revealed — will be launching on your platform, Electronic Arts said Thursday.
Again, no extra details beyond that; Full Circle developers dropped this quick PC-themed tweet, then got back to work:

The first three games in EA’s Skate franchise were all console-only, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Skate fans had worried that a gamepad-intensive game might leave them out, but the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remaster showed the sport does do well as a Windows PC video game, pulling review scores consistent with console versions’ strong marks.
The next Skate game is in development at Full Circle, a studio formed expressly to handle this sequel. Designers said their project was brought to life purely thanks to fan feedback and social media clamor for a series revival. The Skate franchise’s three games were published between 2007 and 2010.</span>

NASCAR 21: Ignition puts a little more power under the hood, and the results look good
 Stock car racing has a new engine — Unreal 4 — with NASCAR 21: Ignition, and it gets a close-up in this gameplay trailer Motorsport Games released during Gamescom 2021. The first look at the game’s cars shows presentation and detail that Ignition’s predecessor, the NASCAR Heat series, would struggle to meet with the Unity engine.
NASCAR 21: Ignition is a from-the-ground-up effort, Motorsport Games chief executive Dmitry Kozko told Polygon earlier this month. The new publishing label (a subsidiary of Motorsport.com’s publishing company) picked up the NASCAR franchise last year. This year’s game uses Unreal 4 as well as Studio 397’s proprietary physics package for the rFac…</span>

Discover the March Through Time exhibit from Time Studios
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech is now viewable in a Fortnite exhibit. 
Time Studios has launched a new interactive educational experience inside Fortnite Creative called March Through Time. This event acts as a virtual museum for players to explore Washington circa 1963, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Fortnite players can visit the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall. They can watch King’s famous speech, which Epic and Time Studios licensed from his family’s estate — a critical piece of history that even the Oscar-nominated 2014 biopic Selma wasn’t able to feature. The interactive exhibit is arriving ahead of the 58th anniversary of the “I Have a Dream” speech, which King delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

      Players can unlock this Fortnite spray by exploring the MLK exhibit.
  
After the speech, players can further explore the in-game museum and even work together in cooperative minigames. After completing various challenges and exploring the museum, Fortnite players can pick up a “DC 63” wall spray for use in the game.
Fortnite players can dive into the March Through Time experience by finding the link in the Discover Menu, or by inputting a special island code: 3815-8892-143.
The makers of huge gaming platforms like Fortnite are increasingly using them for interactive experiences beyond video games, such as educational opportunities. Last July, after the murder of George Floyd, Fortnite hosted a discussion on race in America. Minecraft also features civil rights education in its Lessons in Good Trouble pack, which features the late congressman John Lewis.
March Through Time was inspired by The March, a 2020 digital exhibit from Time magazine, and was developed by Fortnite community members ChaseJackman, GQuanoe, XWDFr, and YU7A.</span>

The former PES will focus more on one-on-one confrontations
 eFootball, the renamed, free-to-play successor to Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer/Winning Eleven franchise, launches later this fall with a new engine (Unreal 4) running the gameplay. Konami on Thursday published a six-minute trailer showing what that’ll look like, and what players will be able to do with eFootball’s reconstituted attacking and defending controls.
Konami’s developers are focusing on the one-on-one confrontations in soccer, and they’re opening up the ball-handling system to allow attackers more moves to break down a defender. At the same time, defenders who are able to anticipate their opponent’s passes and dribble moves should have a better shot at taking control of the ball — making countera…</span>

The classics get revived on iOS, PC, Switch
 You can play another Pokémon-like game later this year, thanks to the upcoming arrival of Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, the remaster of the retro monster collecting games from Koei Tecmo. The collection bundles Monster Rancher (1997) and Monster Rancher 2 (1999), and will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch, Windows PC via Steam, and iOS, Koei Tecmo announced Thursday.
In the Monster Rancher games, players raise monsters and train them to compete against other creatures in combat and tournaments, just like in Pokémon. The original Monster Rancher launched with a fun gimmick where players could use physical CDs to unlock monsters in the game, with each CD corresponding to a monster. 
Most people don’t use CDs anymore, but the developers found a way to rework the feature into their modern version of the game. In Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, you’ll be able to search a database to find each monster’s desired CD and generate a monster from its data. 


The re-release will include new content that wasn’t in the original Western release, like additional save slots, Freeze slots, and Monster Hall of Fame slots. The newer version will bring a few other improvements to gameplay, as well. Players will now be able to use a memo feature while raising monsters, view rankings from random battles, and use a high-speed mode to play through the game faster. 
The Monster Rancher reboots are but a few of the many Pokémon-likes that have been announced or released in recent years. There’s Temtem, a hardcore MMO version of Pokémon released in 2020, and Palword, a game that takes the concept of raising cute monsters and turns it into a brutal survival game, which is due sometime in 2022. Or also, you could just play one of the many actual Pokémon games that are slated to be released in the next few months, like Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</span>

                    <span>Hi folks. I am taking the rest of August off to spend some time with my family near the ocean. I might extend that through Labor Day weekend, who knows? After hitting it hard here during the first year of the pandemic1 — especially in the first several months — I’ve slowed up a bit this summer to give myself some space to recuperate and reconnect with other areas of my life. That’s been nice &amp; necessary and I’m thankful to have a work situation that allows me to do that, but I plan to be back here in September with a renewed vigor. I hope you have a nice rest of your summer (or winter — I see you southern hemisphere) and I’ll see you back here soon. Stay safe, everyone.

“The first year of the pandemic” — even just writing that tightens the chest.↩

                    <span>It may seem like sometimes that with the pandemic, we’re back to square one. With the much more contagious Delta variant in play and an increasing number of breakthrough infections, the efficacy of these vaccines that we thought were amazing maybe aren’t? (Or maybe we just need to readjust our expectations?) But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing &amp; preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:

Even with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention. These vaccines work, we’re lucky to have them, and we need to get as many people worldwide as we can vaccinated as quickly as we can. Period.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning attended a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. Joe Biden and executives from other tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.





Following the summit, the White House said that the companies in attendance pledged their help to bolster U.S. cybersecurity efforts, with Apple planning to develop a program to make security improvements across its technology supply chain (via Bloomberg and CNBC).



Apple will work with suppliers to adopt multi-factor authentication, security training, and incident response in an effort to improve security.



Google plans to invest $10 billion over five years to strengthen cybersecurity, and it plans to train 100,000 Americans in technical fields through its Career Certificate Program. Microsoft pledged $20 billion over five years to provide more advanced security tools and will invest $150 million to help government agencies upgrade their security systems.



IBM plans to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills across three years, and it announced a new data storage solution for critical infrastructure companies. Amazon Web Services plans to give account holders free multi-factor authentication devices to improve security, and it will also offer Security Awareness Training.



During the meeting, President Joe Biden asked tech executives to help improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and economy, urging them to train up a larger cybersecurity workforce and to provide improvements to cybersecurity in their sectors.

                    <span>iOS 15 didn&#x27;t focus heavily on improvements to HomeKit and the Home app, but there are some notable features like expanded HomeKit Secure Video support and new Siri functionality.

‌iOS 15‌ introduces a new iCloud+ service that offers privacy-based features like ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay and Hide My Email, but the feature also comes with ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ improvements.





With ‌iCloud‌+, Apple is increasing the number of ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ cameras supported with each ‌iCloud‌ plan. There have been no changes to ‌iCloud‌ plans and all ‌iCloud‌ plans are now ‌iCloud‌+ plans, but more camera footage can be stored.

                    <span>When iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 launch this fall, iCloud Private Relay will be included, but Apple plans to provide the features as a public beta rather than a finalized addition.





According to Apple&#x27;s release notes for the seventh beta of ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay is being released as a public beta to allow Apple to &quot;gather additional feedback and improve website compatibility&quot; before the official launch of the feature.



So when ‌iOS 15‌ and the other updates are released, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay will be available for customers to use, but it will officially be usable in a beta capacity.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the seventh beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the sixth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

As part of its Tech Transparency Project, the watchdog group said it set up an Apple ID for a fictitious 14-year-old user and used it to download and test 75 apps in the App Store across several adult-oriented genres: dating, hookups, online chat, and casino/gambling. Despite all of these apps being designated as 17+ on the App Store, the investigation found the underage user could easily evade the apps&#x27; age restrictions.



Among the findings presented included a dating app that presented pornography before asking the user&#x27;s age, adult chat …</span>

LaKeith Stanfield, known for &quot;Atlanta&quot; and &quot;Judas and the Black Messiah,&quot; is set to star in the show.





&quot;The Changeling&quot; is described as a &quot;fairytale for grown-ups&quot; that&#x27;s part horror story, part parenthood fable, and a &quot;perilous odyssey through a New York City you didn&#x27;t know existed.&quot;



The book&#x27;s main character, Apollo Kagwa, is an antiquarian book dealer who is beginning to settle into his new life as a devoted father when his wife Emma begins acting strangely and eventually disappears. He meets a mysterious stranger who provides him with information about Emma&#x27;s whereabouts and embarks on a quest to find her.



The series will be written and adapted by Kelly Marcel, known for &quot;Cruella&quot; and &quot;Venom.&quot; Melina Matsoukas, known for &quot;Insecure,&quot; is set to direct.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it is celebrating 105 years of America&#x27;s national parks with a series of initiatives that will help customers learn more about them.




&quot;With every passing year, our national parks only become more precious,&quot; said Tim Cook, Apple&#x27;s CEO. &quot;We&#x27;re honored to play a small role in helping even more people explore the parks, learn about their history, and renew their love and appreciation for the planet we share.&quot;
As was announced earlier this week, Apple is donating $10 to the National Park Foundation for each purchase made with Apple Pay on Apple.com. The promotion will last through August 29, but it is limited to the first 100,000 transactions with a $10 minimum purchase.

                    <span>Apple is currently testing new Face ID hardware that could allow users to unlock their iPhone while wearing a mask or foggy glasses, according to leaker Jon Prosser.





Render of the upgraded Face ID prototype case.




Via his website FrontPageTech.com, Prosser explained that Apple is testing more advanced Face ID hardware using a case that fits snugly around an iPhone 12. The case allows the ‌iPhone‌ to bypass its built-in Face ID system to use that of the case instead.



Prosser believes that the prototype Face ID array matches the exact layout depicted in CAD files of the iPhone 13 from earlier this year. This is because the prototype Face ID hardware in the case is considerably narrower than that of the ‌iPhone 12‌, which would line up with the slimmer notch that is e…</span>

                    <span>Starting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, users with a paid iCloud+ storage plan can personalize their iCloud email address with a custom domain name, such as johnny@appleseed.com, and the feature is now available in beta.





iCloud+ subscribers interested in setting up a custom email domain can visit the beta.icloud.com website, select &quot;Account Settings&quot; under their name, and select &quot;Manage&quot; under &quot;Custom Email Domain.&quot; Users can send and receive email with up to five custom domains, while family members can each have up to three email addresses per domain.



After entering a custom domain on the iCloud website, users can add email addresses that they currently use with the domain. Users can also create new email addresses after they have finished setting up the domain with iCloud, according to Apple. Note that any custom email addresses must not be in use with another Apple ID.





For those who missed the announcement back at WWDC in June, iCloud+ is Apple&#x27;s new branding for paid iCloud storage combined with new features like iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email. iCloud+ features are included with iCloud storage plans at no additional cost, with prices remaining set at $0.99 per month for 50GB of storage, $2.99 per month for 200GB of storage, or $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage in the United States.



The ability to use a custom email address for iCloud is not to be confused with Hide My Email, a separate iCloud+ feature that allows users to create unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox so they can send and receive email without having to share their real email address.

                    <span>The iPhone has failed to serve as a gateway product to the Mac, Apple TV, and HomePod for over 50 percent of ‌iPhone‌ users, while the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods have seen considerably better popularity among ‌iPhone‌ owners, according to data gathered by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).

The CIRP investigation sought to ascertain the extent to which ‌iPhone‌ users have bought other Apple devices, given the fact that Apple seeks to cross-sell its entire product line to its core customers.

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re tracking a few deals at Best Buy, including record low prices on the iPhone 12 mini and iPad mini 5.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



iPhone 12 mini


To start, you can get Apple&#x27;s 64GB iPhone 12 mini from T-Mobile for $429.99, down from $729.99. This $300 off discount is only available when you select T-Mobile as a carrier, and it&#x27;s a one-time payment that requires activation with T-Mobile at purchase.




$300 OFF
64GB iPhone 12 mini for $429.99





You can save $300 on most models of the iPhone 12 mini: the 128GB is available for $479.99, and the 256GB is available for $579.99. Additionally, Best Buy is offering $75 off some iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max models. Note that all of these savings are seen only under T-Mobile on Best Buy.



iPad mini 5


Best Buy also has $100 off Apple&#x27;s iPad mini 5, starting at $299.99 for 64GB Wi-Fi, down from $399.99. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi model for $449.99, down from $549.99.




$100 OFF
64GB iPad mini 5 for $299.99





Both sales represent matches for the previous all-time low prices on the iPad mini 5. We&#x27;re expecting a refresh of the iPad mini lineup sometime this fall, which is likely the reason why we&#x27;re now seeing frequent discounts on the 2019 model.

                    <span>Facebook today announced updates coming to Facebook Messenger as the app and service celebrates its tenth birthday. The new features include a new game, tighter integration with Facebook Pay, message effects, and more. 





For Messenger users in the United States, Messenger now allows you to receive cash gifts directly within the app. This is being enabled thanks to Facebook Pay, and when cash is received, it comes wrapped in a gift with virtual balloons. 

In the US, we&#x27;re introducing a new way to receive cash gifts directly through Messenger. When a friend sends you a cash gift for your birthday, you&#x27;ll be notified on Messenger and Facebook with their gift message wrapped and accompanied by virtual balloons. Once you confirm your Facebook Pay details, the cash gift will be instantly deposited into your bank account. To send a birthday cash gift, go to the Facebook mobile app and tap the button that appears alongside your friend&#x27;s birthday posts in your Facebook News Feed or their profile.

In more celebratory features, Messenger is releasing a new &quot;Messenger is 10!&quot; sticker pack to users, offering fun effects such as purple balloons or candles. Announced previously, users can also utilize &quot;Soundmoji&quot; and message effects to spruce up their chats.



Smaller features include an updated way to share contacts with other friends and family, and a sneak peek at &quot;Word Effects.&quot; According to Messenger, Word Effects will be rolling out soon and will let users add specific emoji effects to specific words.

                    <span>Zoom today announced the latest version of its popular video conferencing app, and one of the key new features is gesture recognition on the iPad, enabling users to use visual gestures to automatically use a corresponding meeting reaction.





The feature currently supports the &quot;Raise Hand&quot; and &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; reactions. If you raise your hand or give a thumbs up in real life, a hand or thumbs up icon will automatically appear alongside your video feed in a Zoom meeting. A raised hand typically indicates that you have a question and would like to be unmuted to speak.



Zoom has also received a new Focus Mode, chat sidebar enhancements, and several other new features, as outlined in the full release notes.



iPad and iPhone users can update to the latest version of Zoom through the App Store.

                    <span>Apple is preparing to open its first retail store in the Chinese province of Hunan, according to a new official webpage on the company&#x27;s website, as well as images shared on Twitter.





The official webpage offers no date for when the store will launch; however, its opening could be relatively close given the store is plastered with marketing material in anticipation. Apple is advertising the store with the following tagline [translated]:

The first law to open your mind is that there is no law. In Changsha, it is a great truth not to set limits for Reiki. Apple Changsha welcomes all kinds of whimsical ideas to let go of their hands and feet and break out of their own world.
On its website, Apple offers wallpapers for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac to celebrate the store&#x27;s opening. The new store will be the first retail store for the Hunan province.

                    <span>Apple today shared a new &quot;Today at Apple&quot; session on YouTube, exploring how to shoot expressive pet portrait photos, with the help of photographer Sophie Gamand and Jahmyra from Today at Apple.








The playful session encourages participants to use their iPhone at the correct height, tune into the pet&#x27;s personality, and take a look at showcase pet portraits for inspiration and top takeaways.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the fifth Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with previous sessions looking at drawing yourself as a &quot;Peanuts&quot; character in the Pages app using an ‌‌iPad‌‌ and ‌‌Apple Pencil‌‌, shooting and editing &quot;otherworldly&quot; photos with Night Mode, creating looped videos in the Clips app, and shooting portrait photos.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Google has rolled out picture-in-picture support as an &quot;experimental&quot; feature for YouTube premium subscribers, allowing them to watch video in a small window when the app is closed.





If you&#x27;re a premium YouTube subscriber looking to try out picture-in-picture, follow these steps: 


Launch a web browser and sign into your YouTube account at YouTube.com.

Navigate to www.youtube.com/new.


Scroll down to &quot;Picture-in-picture on iOS&quot;.


Click &quot;Try it out.&quot;
Now, when you&#x27;re in the YouTube app watching a video, return to your Home Screen by swiping up/pressing the Home button, and the picture-in-picture mini player will pop up. Google notes that locking your phone when watching in picture-in-picture mode will pause the video, but you can resume it by using the Lock Screen media controls.





Google in June announced that picture-in-picture support would be rolling out to both premium and non-paying YouTube app users in the U.S., but some people outside the U.S. have been able to get the experimental feature working, so it could be globally available. 


How to Use Picture in Picture Mode on iPhone


However, Google says the feature is only available until October 31. The company doesn&#x27;t explain what happens after that, but hopefully that&#x27;s when support rolls out to both paying subscribers and non-paying users, as originally promised. Whether it will still be available globally outside of its &quot;experimental&quot; context remains to be seen, though.

                    <span>Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.





The screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the ‌AirPods‌ 3 on September 30.



Apart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt. 



That said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.



The new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple&#x27;s third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.

                    <span>Christine Clarridge, reporting for The Seattle Times:
A passenger’s cellphone caught on fire inside the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight from New Orleans to Seattle that had landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday evening. It was a Samsung Galaxy A21, according to Perry Cooper, a spokesman for the Port of Seattle.
“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.”
The crew on Flight 751 extinguished the fire with a battery containment bag, but smoke forced the deployment of evacuation slides, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told KOMO-TV.
Good thing no one was hurt. Bad day for Samsung PR. Hope we find out more about exactly how this happened.

Chuck is really changing over the roster, eh?
 The Philadelphia Flyers will just not stop adding some damn dudes to this damn roster!
Announced by the team on Wednesday, they have signed free agent center Derick Brassard to a one-year, $825,000 deal.
OFFICIAL: We&#x27;ve signed forward Derick Brassard to a one-year deal!  ✍️ https://t.co/Qd1YwAFjqA

Brassard, 33, is a veteran’s veteran forward, having appeared in a total of 905 NHL games for eight(!) different organizations. Now his ninth in Philadelphia, Brassard is reunited with his former head coach during his time as a member of the New York Rangers, Alain Vigneault. The center played three seasons under Vigneault from the 2013-14 season to his 2015-16 …</span>

He led the team in a major statistical category at just 20 years old.
 Out of every player in the Flyers’ forward group, Joel Farabee took the biggest step forward in 2020-21, and it isn’t even close.



If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native. 
By The Numbers


As you can see, Farabee scored 20 goals, which led the Flyers! In fact, he led the NHL in goals among players aged 22 or younger. That’s pretty impressive considering the likes of Brady Tkachuk, Patrik Laine, Martin Necas all populate that list. Farabee is right there a…</span>

It took a minute, but the former first-round pick has established himself firmly as part of the Flyers’ core.
 Teams that win the Stanley Cup always tend to have depth players that prove to be integral along the way, whether or it be during the regular to propel the club in or to get over the hump in the postseason — the Flyers are hoping on Scott Laughton being one of them at some point. 
The 20th overall pick back in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft has had quite the journey towards a regular role in the league, and has put in the work over the years in order to do it. A prime example being the 2016-17 season in which Laughton was essentially told to spend the year in the American Hockey League and remake his game — to focus on transforming hi…</span>

It’s dark and I’m scared of the Philadelphia Flyers Aquaman Jason Momoa.
 It’s raining outside. Dim spotlights cast from street lamps draw circles on the wet pavement of a dark road, leading like markers all the way up to the abandoned house. No one lives there anymore, not since the accident that destroyed lives, families, and an entire town. All that is left is creaking doors and battered floorboards covered in dust.
You step closer to the house. There is a figure. The slow pendulum of light behind it, swaying back and forth, casting shadows across the broken-down porch that only the grimiest of rats call home. Light bouncing through the street and onto your face. Giving you just enough ability to see what is standing in the …</span>

Season 0 includes a new battle pass and a new map
 Splitgate has technically been out for over two years, but its recent move onto console and into open beta has revived the free-to-play shooter, raising its profile on Twitch and elsewhere. In fact, two years after its early access release it’s finally getting new seasons of content. The first season, dubbed season 0, has already started and was announced on Wednesday during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live presentation.  
Splitgate has had battle passes before, but this new opt-in is full of cosmetic items for players to unlock. It’s accompanied by a new patch, which contains with a few much needed balance and quality-of-life tweaks. One thing players will likely notice right away about the cosmetics in that they’r…</span>

The pinnacle PvP mode is getting a major rework
 Destiny’s pinnacle multiplayer experience, Trials, has seen some major issues in Destiny 2. But on Sept. 10, Bungie will upgrade the game mode with a host of changes.
First, Trials of the Osiris won’t be available every weekend anymore. The mode won’t open during the first week of new seasons or before world first raid races. And Trials won’t launch at all on Iron Banner weeks. 
Bungie’s biggest change for the game mode is to matchmaking. Players won’t need to have a three-player team ready in orbit before launching the activity. Starting Sept. 10, players can matchmake with other groups. Bungie will add a solos only “freelance” playlist in the future, which will only match solo players together, just like Iron Banner’…</span>

Combat Evolved
 Splitgate, the new in-beta free-to-play arena shooter from 1047 Games, is what would happen if you stuck Halo 3 and Portal in a blender. The result is a game where no single mechanic feels completely unique, but they all mix together into a fantastic multiplayer offering, and a much-needed update for a very tired genre. 



Splitgate was originally released in early access in 2019 as a fairly barebones version of the game that never really caught on. However, after two years of updates from 1047 Games, the game is now in open beta on PC and consoles. It’s significantly improved, which players have certainly seemed to notice. And with the recent announcement of its first real content season, it seems like Splitgate is going to stick around this ti…</span>

 It should come as no surprise that the next Saints Row, launching in February, is a complete reboot of Volition’s open-world crime spree franchise.

Open beta on PC follows several delays
 Amazon’s New World has been delayed multiple times since 2020, but it appears the Sept. 28 release date announced in August will be the one that sticks. During Gamescom’s Opening Night Live broadcast, Amazon announced the open beta will run Sept. 9-12.
A closed beta was held back in July. Delays for New World began in April 2020, following problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. New World is an MMO, for Windows PC, where players colonize a fictional continent somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Players in groups of 50 or so can battle one another in massive fights.
Amazon Game Studios first announced the game in 2016 at TwitchCon, alongside two other PC games: Breakaway, which was canceled, and Crucible, which was released and then un-released before development was eventually stopped.
Gamescom is ongoing this week, though Microsoft held a pre-show event on Tuesday, where it made announcements regarding Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox Game Pass, and, of course, trebuchets.</span>

King Louie, Baloo, Mowgli, and Shere Khan will get their own bean skins
 Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout showed up at Tuesday’s Gamescom: Opening Night Live event and revealed a bizarre crossover: Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book skins are coming to Fall Guys. But these skins aren’t modeled after the modern adaptations, they’re pulled, hauntingly, from the animated movie of your childhood. 
Starting in early September, players can pick up skins based on Mowgli, Shere Khan, Baloo, and King Louie. Like all bean skins, The Jungle Book crossover skins feature a top and bottom, with the top featuring full versions of the animated character’s heads. 
King Louie will get his own in-game event from Sept. 3-12 — it’s currently unclear if this event will add any new maps next month. The other The Jungle Book skins will have different availability, which Mediatonic will reveal in a follow-up blog.
The Jungle Book inclusion is all part of Fall Guys season 5’s jungle theme, which launched in July. Players can begin dressing their beans as these iconic characters in just a few weeks.</span>

Up to four players can be terrified at the same time
 Outlast Trials, the third entry in the bloody first-person survival horror game from the team at Red Barrels, revealed its first gameplay trailer on Wednesday. It arrived as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live streaming event by Geoff Keighley.
The original Outlast was a PlayStation 4 exclusive released in 2013. Its success led to a sequel, Outlast 2, released in 2017. Red Barrels is still in control of the franchise, and has an intimidating new wrinkle for dedicated fans; cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.

“Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shadowy Murkoff Corporation,” reads the game’s official description. “Imprisoned in a secret Murkoff facility, players will be thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact.”
No release date was announced, and no platforms were mentioned either. You can find out more on the game’s official website.</span>

                    <span>Jett: The Far Shore is a chilled out space exploration game
 The co-creator of Sword &amp; Sworcery, Superbrothers, announced a release date and showed a new trailer for their sci-fi game, Jett: The Far Shore during Gamescom: Opening Night Live on Wednesday. 
Jett: The Far Shore will come to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store on Oct. 5. Superbrothers is creating the game in partnership with Pine Scented, and Scntfc is making the score for the game. Pre-orders are going live today. 
Jett: The Far Shore was originally announced in June 2020. Since then, the studio has said that the game would be delayed to 2021. Now we know when it’ll come this fall. 
The game looks like a chilled out space exploration game. You play as Mei, a researcher who is part of a group of aviator scientists who embark on an interstellar trip and arrive on an ocean planet. New footage showed that you’ll be doing plenty of cruising around in your space ship, as well as checking out the planet on foot.</span>

Biking, boarding, and wingsuiting available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC
 Riders Republic’s beta is now open to the public on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The beta runs from Wednesday, Aug. 25 until Saturday, Aug. 28.
Ubisoft presented the game with a two-minute trailer introducing players to Riders Republic, which resembles a Forza Horizon-style racing festival with X-Games-like biking, snowboarding, and wingsuit flying events.
Riders Republic launches Oct. 28, 2021 on the beta platforms, as well as on Google Stadia and Amazon Luna. It was first revealed in September 2020, and originally due in February, but was delayed to this fall in order to deliver “the best fun-fueled experience to our players,” Ubisoft Annecy said at the time. The studio is also the team behind Steep, the 2016 skiing and snowboarding video game.
In Riders Republic, players will ski, snowboard, bike, and glide in “an extreme sports fantasyland” set in virtual versions of U.S. national parks, including Bryce Canyon, Yosemite Valley, Sequoia, Zion, and Mammoth Mountain.</span>

She even does a mic drop
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, the new retro beat-’em-up inspired by the classic Konami arcade games, will of course feature Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello on its playable roster. At Gamescom 2021 on Wednesday, developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu revealed that intrepid reporter April O’Neil will also kick ass in Shredder’s Revenge.
April will wield her microphone and television camera as deadly weapons in battles against Foot soldiers, but she’s also a capable hand-to-hand martial artist. Some of April’s moves look inspired by another female fighter, Chun-li from Street Fighter and her tenshokyaku rising air kick. “Her agility and far-reaching slide kicks help her close in on targets quickly, and she once again proves the turtles can rely on her unwavering support, even through slices of pizza,” Dotemu said in an official description.
A new trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge also shows off team moves — watch as Leonardo picks April up and turns her into a deadly bowling ball — and the ability to revive teammates with (what else?) a slice of pizza.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is coming to Nintendo Switch and PC in 2022.</span>

                    <span>Remember Scanwiches? There was even a book version in 2011 and Helen Rosner wrote about the site for Saveur.
To create an image, he simply places half a sandwich on the glass of his Epson V700 scanner. “There’s not a lot of trickery,” says Chonko, who will release a book based on the site in November, with Powerhouse Books. “I try to stay true to the heart and soul of the sandwich. That’s a lofty way to think about it. But then I eat it for lunch.”


The site has stopped publishing new scans, but it’s still good, still delicious. And is a hot dog a scanwich? Apparently so.

                    <span>Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.
The painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.
But when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.
Following further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.


There is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?

                    <span>By making public health central to their health care system, Costa Rica has achieved a higher life expectancy than the US for a fraction of the cost. How did they do it? The New Yorker’s Atul Gawande investigates.
Life expectancy tends to track national income closely. Costa Rica has emerged as an exception. Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States — and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours — life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years. In the United States, life expectancy peaked at just under seventy-nine years, in 2014, and has declin…</span>

Hao Kuo Chi collected more than 620,000 private photos and videos by impersonating Apple customer support staff and sending out emails to trick his victims into providing Apple IDs and passwords. Chi used social engineering and phishing schemes to coerce his victims, and he did not breach Apple&#x27;s ‌iCloud‌ protections.



Chi accessed photos and videos from at least 306 victims across the United States, and most of them were young women.

                    <span>Hulu this week began implementing HDR, HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision for some of its original television shows and movies, so Apple TV owners can now watch Hulu content in HDR.





HDR content offers a higher contrast range for more detail, and Hulu TV shows and movies that support HDR content will display an HDR badge on the details page if they are available to stream in HDR.





Hulu&#x27;s HDR content is available on the fifth-generation ‌Apple TV‌ 4K and later, as well as the Chromecast Ultra, Fire TV devices, Roku devices, and Vizio TVs. HDR support is not available on mobile devices at this time.



As noted by CNET, HDR support is limited to Hulu originals, which includes &quot;Handmaid&#x27;s Tale,&quot; &quot;Little Fires Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers,&quot; &quot;Future Man,&quot; &quot;Castle Rock,&quot; and more.



Hulu appears to be rolling out support for HDR, so not all ‌Apple TV‌ users may see it available immediately.

South Korea&#x27;s legislation and judiciary committee is expected to approve an &quot;Anti-Google Law&quot; that amends the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It will require Apple and Google to allow third-party payment methods in their app stores in South Korea, and it will let developers use independent payment systems.



If the amendment is approved by the committee, the National Assembly of South Korea will hold a final vote on Wednesday.

                    <span>In late April, Spotify began testing a Podcast Subscriptions program as a way for creators to offer paid subscriber-only content to listeners, and today the streaming music service announced this monetization option is now available to all U.S. creators. Spotify said creators can mark episodes as subscriber-only and publish them to Spotify and other platforms through its podcast creation platform Anchor.





Spotify also announced that it plans to expand the Podcast Subscriptions program internationally starting September 15 of this year.



Spotify said its model is built to maximize revenue for creators, who will receive 100% of subscription revenue minus payment processing fees until 2023, when the company plans to implement a 5% fee on subscription revenue.



Two changes are being made to the program to benefit creators: additional pricing tiers for subscription fees and the option to download a list of email addresses for subscribers so creators can further engage with their audiences.



Apple rolled out its own Podcasts Subscriptions feature worldwide in June, with the company receiving 30% of a subscriber&#x27;s revenue in the first year and 15% if they remain subscribed for longer than one year. Creators are also required to enroll in the Apple Podcasters Program for $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions.



Benefits of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions for creators include the ability to offer subscriptions for individual shows or for groups of shows through a &quot;channels&quot; feature, the choice to offer fully paid subscriptions or freemium subscriptions with a mix of free and paid episodes, and availability in over 170 countries and regions today. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions also has options for soliciting subscriber email addresses.

Questions were widespread after ‌Tim Cook‌ took over, including whether Cook would continue in the footsteps of Jobs or create a new vision for the future of Apple.



A day after he became CEO, Cook sent a letter to Apple employees, promising that despite Jobs no longer being at the helm, Apple &quot;is not going to change.&quot;

                    <span>The upcoming 14-inch MacBook Pro is set to be more expensive than the current 13-inch MacBook Pro and both the 14 and 16-inch models will offer the same performance, according to the leaker known as &quot;Dylandkt.&quot;





The leaker shared the information on Twitter, explaining that both of the upcoming MacBook Pro models, expected to come in 14 and 16-inch sizes, will feature the same performance due to having the same &quot;M1X&quot; chip.



Currently, the 16-inch MacBook Pro offers a significant performance improvement over the high-end 13-inch models due to its more powerful Intel chips and better thermals, so bringing the two model sizes to parity could be a major boost for owners of the smaller, more portable model.

                    <span>Google-owned Fitbit appears to be readying an update to its Charge fitness tracker lineup, based on a leaked video and renders of the wearable shared online.

With a price tag said to be $179, the Fitbit Charge 5 will be $50 more expensive than the current Charge 4, but there are some obvious hardware changes on the way that have more in common with the Fitbit luxe, not least being a full-color rounded display that traces the curve of the ergonomic wrist strap.



The images suggest the device will have capacitive touch areas on the sides, and according to the leaked video, the Charge 5 will additionally have built-in GPS and ECG sensors, as well as an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor that claims to track your stress levels.



The EDA sensor plays into the company&#x27;s Daily Readiness Score, which is a subscriber-only Fitbit Premium feature ($10 per month or $80 per year). The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.

Every device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.



The Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there&#x27;s no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that&#x27;s expected to be announced in the next month or so.

Season of the Lost adds a handful of new Exotics for Guardians
 Another Destiny 2 season is here, and that means more Exotics for Guardians to get their hands on. With Season of the Lost, players can expect the usual seasonal Exotic weapon, one Exotic armor piece per class, and more. Season of the Lost has at least one bonus Exotic quest. 
However, we don’t know everything about the Exotics coming this season. Bungie has officially revealed four through the in-game collection, but it’s hiding one more. Here’s a look at the four Exotics we know about, and everything we know about the fifth. As in past seasons, players can get the new Armor Exotics by soloing Master or Legend Lost Sectors.

No glasses needed for this nifty, forced-perspective rendering
 Some of the greatest games take the novel experiences of real life and translate them into a cunning virtual experience. For example, this train building game by James Vanas is reminiscent of the feeling of holding one of those plastic 3D bookmarks sold in tchotchke tourist shops.

Microsoft offers updates on Forza Horizon 5, Flight Simulator, and more
 Microsoft gave Xbox fans an end-of-summer update at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday, revealing new details about upcoming games like Forza Horizon 5 and Age of Empires 4, as well as released (or soon-to-be-released) games like Microsoft Flight Simulator and Psychonauts 2. If you didn’t catch the nearly-90-minute stream, we’ve got a quick rundown of what’s new in the world of Xbox and PC gaming.
But before you start scrolling, we’ll set an important expectation: Xbox Game Studios and 343 Industries did not announce a final release date for Halo Infinite at Gamescom. That game is still slated to hit Xbox consoles and PC sometime this holiday season.
The Xbox team will have more to share on Wednesday, Aug. 25, at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the pre-show event hosted by Geoff Keighley. This post will be updated with whatever Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios has left to announced at Gamescom 2021 later this week.</span>

Procedural storytelling meets player narrative in one of the year’s best games
 Wildermyth clicked for me when my greatest warrior’s human head was transformed into the head of a raven. She had just spent an evening sassing a woman cloaked in black, making fun of her mystical ways, and when that woman turned into a flock of crows the next day, my warrior’s life was never the same. She went on to slay a bunch of constructs made from cogwheels and bones by ripping at their armor with her razor-sharp beak. She entered into myth as a part-woman, part-bird, and all-powerful ass-kicking hero who bought the land a hundred years of peace. 



That story wasn’t fully written by the devs of Wildermyth. There is no warrior-bird hero questline in the game. The random…</span>

Age of Empires 4’s memeable siege unit gets some love in ‘Hands on History’
 Trebuchets — “the ultimate medieval siege weapon,” not the sans-serif typeface created by Microsoft — are coming to Age of Empires 4 and players will be able to learn all about them in the game’s “Hands on History” segments,  developers World’s Edge and Relic Entertainment announced at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday. Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, offered a (very) deep dive into the fan-favorite, highly memed trebuchet during Xbox’s Gamescom stream, as a way to teach players about medieval history.


Age of Empires 4 will include 28 unlockable Hands on History videos, each of which was “filmed on location with experts around the world.” In the case of ye olde trebuchet, mechanical engineer Dr. Shini Somara explained how the don’t-call-it-a-catapult works at Warwick Castle in England during a three-minute-long segment shown at Tuesday’s livestream.
World’s Edge and Relic showed off the Age of Empires 4 trebuchet in action in-game last week, in a trailer that offers a short but satisfying burst of projectile lobbing and castle sieging.


They’ve also shown off other weapons of war coming to Age of Empires 4, including the Nest of Bees, which I only learned about today and was crestfallen to discover does not shoot actual bees.
Age of Empires 4 launches on Oct. 28, on Windows PC via Steam and the Windows Store. It will be available for Xbox Game Pass for PC on launch day.</span>

Season of the Lost will lead straight into The Witch Queen
 Destiny 2’s latest season, Season of the Lost, is here, and it’ll need to keep Guardians occupied for the next six months. Season of the Lost is the final season ahead of Destiny 2’s The Witch Queen expansion, which Bungie revealed alongside Season of the Lost on Tuesday. 
For players concerned about a content drought, Season of the Lost promises some major changes to Destiny 2. Players will finally get their hands on cross play, anti cheat, a Trials of Osiris rework, and dozens of key balance changes. All of that also comes with the usual salvo of seasonal content. 
Here’s a look at the content and updates coming in Season of the Lost. For the complete patch notes, scroll down.…</span>

Destiny will finally get a weapon crafting system as well
 Players finally know what to expect with Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the game’s fourth expansion, thanks to Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday. The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.
The Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.
The Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.
The studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.
The Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.</span>

The power is in your palms
 The Xbox Gamescom presentation on Tuesday showed off indie titles heading to Xbox Games Pass, but one of them stood out from the bunch. Into the Pit is a fast-paced game that pulls off retro graphics and gameplay. It’s Doom, but you’re a wizard casting spells and firing off magical bolts instead of firing a gun. 
In Into the Pit, you play a member of a family of mystics. Your cousin has gone missing, and it probably has something to do with the demonic pit she uncovered in her search for occult power. From there, the player has to run through a roguelite dungeon, mixing and matching runes and spells to become better at killing demons.
Into the Pit is set to release on PC and Xbox One on Oct. 19, which makes it a perfect pre-Halloween experience for those who enjoy old school FPS gameplay. The game will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

Microsoft says Xbox One will be able to stream Xbox Series X games
 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can cloud-stream games on both Xbox Series X and Xbox One this holiday season, Microsoft announced Tuesday during Gamescom 2021.

Their 2018 debut album IIIIXXI […]</span>

                    <span>You might want to take a deep breath or do a couple of laps around the house before watching this video about a community in the Ozarks with a very low Covid-19 vaccination rate. Here’s a sample. An ICU patient wearing an oxygen mask on why he didn’t get vaccinated:
I’m more of a libertarian and I don’t like being told what I have to do. I’m still not completely 100% sold on the inoculation.


Video narrator:
It was eerie to hear Christopher insist on his individual freedoms even as he struggled to breathe.


Can you hear me screaming all the way from my desk to wherever you are? I don’t like being told what I have to do?! Fucking hell. And this:
There’s no better place to see the impact of this political rhetoric than in the hospital. Only about 50 percent of the staff are vaccinated. None of the unvaccinated staffers were willing to talk.


Absolutely maddening. I want off this ride.

Instead it was a year in limbo: school on stuttering Zoom, school in person and then back home again for quarantine, school all the time and none of the time. No part of it was good, for kids or parents, but most parts of it were safe, and somehow, impossibly, we made it through a full year. It was hell, but we did it. We did it.
Time collapsed and it was summer again, and, briefly, things looked better. We began to dream of normalcy, of trips and jobs and school. But 2021’s hot vax summer only truly delivered on the hot part, as vaccination rates slowed and the Delta variant cut through some …</span>

                    <span>I love this post from the NYPL comparing astronomical drawings by E.L. Trouvelot done in the 1870s to contemporary NASA images.
Trouvelot was a French immigrant to the US in the 1800s, and his job was to create sketches of astronomical observations at Harvard College’s observatory. Building off of this sketch work, Trouvelot decided to do large pastel drawings of “the celestial phenomena as they appear…through the great modern telescopes.”


He made drawings of Saturn, Jupiter, aurora borealis, the Milky Way, and more. Here’s his incredible drawing of sun spots compared to a recent image of the Sun’s surface:


And his drawing of a solar eclipse compared to a recent image:


Check out the post for more examples of Trouvelot’s work.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join other tech executives in a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden next week, reports Bloomberg.





The meeting will focus on the efforts by private companies to improve cybersecurity following a surge in online attacks over the course of the last year, an official familiar with the event told Bloomberg.
The executives could discuss efforts undertaken by critical infrastructure entities, including those in the banking, energy and water utility sectors, to improve cybersecurity and collaborations with the government. The tech executives are likely to discuss how software can drive better security in the supply chain, the senior official said.
The meeting will include Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.

                    <span>Facebook is re-adding voice and video calling features to its main Facebook app after moving the features to Messenger back in 2014, reports Bloomberg.





Users in some countries including the United States are now able to make voice or video calls directly from the Facebook app. As of now, Facebook is testing the feature, which is meant to cut down on the number of times that Facebook users need to swap over to the Messenger app.



Messenger and Facebook used to be a single app, but in 2014, Facebook split them into separate apps and removed Messenger functionality from Facebook. Customers were forced to download the Messenger app to send private messages to other Facebook users or to make phone calls using the Facebook platform.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(9 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple appears to be expanding on the native Apple Maps review functionality that it first introduced in iOS 14, allowing ‌Apple Maps‌ users in the United States the option to review places of interest, restaurants, and other locations.





In the ‌Apple Maps‌ app in ‌iOS 14‌ and iOS 15, U.S. users can now see an option to provide a thumbs up or thumbs down for most locations. Tapping on the thumbs up/down icon brings up a secondary interface for providing thumbs up and thumbs down ratings for various categories like products, customer service, food, atmosphere, and more, based on the location being reviewed.



Users also have the option to upload photos of the location to the ‌Apple Maps‌ app to be added to the maps listing.





At the current time, the ‌Apple Maps‌ native rating system is displayed alongside the Yelp ratings that are provided for various locations. Apple may eventually be planning to replace Yelp and TripAdvisor integrations, but will need to build up a database of ratings before that will be possible.



There are no options for written reviews at this time, however, so it is not clear if Apple plans to entirely replace Yelp.



Native rating options in the ‌Apple Maps‌ app appear to be new for users in the United States, but Apple has been testing the feature in other countries like the UK and Australia for some time now. Ratings may also be available in additional countries based on the Ratings and Photos Terms legal site for Maps that was shared on Reddit.

                    <span>Pop star and actress Olivia Rodrigo today released the music video for her song &quot;brutal,&quot; off of her debut album &quot;SOUR&quot;. For the video, Rodrigo partnered up with Apple to create a suite of augmented reality face masks using an iPad Pro.







Alongside the release of the music video, Rodrigo shared a few clips on Instagram that showcased her editing the AR face masks using an ‌iPad Pro‌ and an Apple Pencil. The face masks can be seen throughout the video, and include effects like drooping tears made of fire, rainbow hearts, a robot mask, and much more.








Interscope Records, which is Rodrigo&#x27;s label, has a history of using Apple to promote many of its artists. This includes Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, both of which had music videos shot on iPhone in recent years, and Billie Eilish, whose documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s A Little Blurry&quot; debuted on Apple TV+ earlier this summer.

                    <span>Upcoming Apple TV+ movie &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on the final day of the event, Sunday, October 17.





Apple also plans to offer preview screenings of the film at London Film Festival partner cinemas across the UK.



Written by Joel Coen, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to star Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. Filmed entirely in black and white, the movie is described as a &quot;bold and fierce adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s classic, a tale of murder, madness, ambition, and wrathful cunning.&quot;



&quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is the first film directed by a single Coen brother. Joel Coen and his brother Ethan Coen have been responsible for hit movies that include &quot;The Big Lebowski,&quot; &quot;No Country for Old Men,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;



Apple announced that it had acquired the rights to the movie back in May, and the film is being produced by Apple partner A24. Apple has previously worked with A24 on &quot;On the Rocks,&quot; starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones.



After premiering in theaters, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; will be available on ‌Apple TV+‌, but Apple has not yet provided a date for its availability.

                    <span>Apple has today shared a trailer for the second season of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and highlighted the impending return of the award-winning Apple Original drama series.






The second season of the show will feature ten episodes, and continues to star Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also serve as executive producers. Other returning cast members include Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Bel Powley, Desean Terry, Janina Gavankar, Tom Irwin, and Marcia Gay Harden. 



The Morning Show was one of Apple TV+&#x27;s flagship original shows when the video streaming service launched in late 2019. Apple describes the second season as follows:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds &quot;The Morning Show&quot; team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley&#x27;s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.




The first episode of the second season of The Morning Show will debut on Friday, September 17 exclusively on ‌Apple TV+‌, followed by one new episode weekly, every Friday. The complete first season is available to watch now.

As noted by Deadline, Reynolds and McElhenney responded over the weekend by tweeting a letter that sarcastically threatens legal action against Apple TV+ over the joke. 



&quot;While we hold the incomparable Jeremy Swift in no ill regard and are honored to be mentioned on the platform that&#x27;s brought us high-quality programming ranging from Mythic Quest season one to Mythic Quest season two, we must insist that you cease and desist from the casting of any doubt regarding our commitment to the club, the fans and the entire Wrexham community,&quot; the letter reads in part.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will make an unspecified donation to the National Park Foundation for each qualifying Apple Pay purchase at an Apple Store, on Apple.com, or in the Apple Store app in the United States from August 23 through August 29.





The promotion is limited to the first 100,000 transactions and it is subject to a $10 minimum purchase with Apple Pay, according to fine print on Apple&#x27;s website.



This is at least the fifth consecutive year that Apple has ran this promotion in support of the National Park Foundation, the official charitable partner of the National Park Service in the United States. Apple CEO Cook has expressed his appreciation for national parks, and in an interview last year he said that Apple Park has conference rooms named after U.S. national parks, such as the Grand Canyon room near his personal office.



On August 25, all U.S. national parks that charge an entrance fee will offer free admission in celebration of the National Park Service&#x27;s birthday. On August 28, Apple Watch users around the world can earn an Activity Challenge award themed after national parks by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6km) or longer.

Apple had been testing ‌Touch ID‌ technology that would have allowed the company to place the sensor under the display on the ‌iPhone‌, allowing users to simply put their finger on the display to authenticate. While Apple regularly tests and researches new ideas and technologies, reports earlier in the year had suggested the company was on track to include ‌Touch ID‌ under the display with the 2021 iPhones.

                    <span>Effective next year, pricing for all commercial plans of Microsoft 365 will be increased as a way to compensate for the &quot;increased value&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s suite of tools has provided to customers over the last ten years, Microsoft has announced.





In a blog post late last week, the company says the new changes are the first time it has substantively increased the price of Office 365 since it launched a decade ago. Microsoft notes some of the ways that Microsoft 365 has grown in prominence over the last year, including that it has added 24 different apps to its suite of tools. 

Since its launch a decade ago, Office 365 has grown to over 300 million commercial paid seats. Along the way, we have continuously re-invested to meet the changing needs of our customers. Four years ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to bring together the best of Office, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS). That same year we added Microsoft Teams as the only integrated solution where you can meet, chat, call, collaborate, and automate business processes—right in the flow of work.



In fact, since introducing Microsoft 365 we have added 24 apps to the suites—Microsoft Teams, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Stream, Planner, Visio, OneDrive, Yammer, and Whiteboard—and have released over 1,400 new features and capabilities in three key areas.
The pricing increases are small, consisting of only $2-$4 hikes, and are as followed:

Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user), Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22), Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10), Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23), Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38), and Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36).
All of the changes will apply globally on March 1, 2022.

                    <span>Jacqueline Howard, reporting for CNN:
The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older. This is the first coronavirus vaccine approved by the FDA, and is expected to open the door to more vaccine mandates.
Way more mandates. Mandate vaccinated status for everything. School, air travel, train travel, restaurants, stores. Everything. Get vaccinated or stay home.
The vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty, the FDA said in its announcement on Monday.
I don’t care what they call it, but that’s a bad name. Looks like someone spilled a drink on the keyboard while trying to type “Cormac McCarthy”.
(Moderna has secured “Spikevax” for their vaccine, an excellent name.)

Get it? Because he’s from Austria? Please laugh.
 After heading to Dallas in free agency in search of winning a Stanley Cup, Michael Raffl leaves behind an interesting legacy after eight seasons as a Flyer. The non-Swiss army knife and longtime bottom six presence initially departed at the trade deadline, heading to Washington in exchange for a fifth round pick in 2021 that became Ty Murchison.



While many would (fairly or unfairly) tag him as a career just-a-guy, it’s important to remember that Raffl was, at one point, a very effective NHLer. Unfortunately for him and fans of the Orange &amp; Black, that wasn’t the case in 2020-21. Let’s look at why.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *In case you forgot, development camp starts this week! The end of this week, but still. This week. Hockey players, on ice, in Voorhees. [Flyers]
*Big news over the weekend though was the Flyers getting a deal done with Travis Sanheim, without the help of the arbiter. [BSH]
*He got a raise, of course, because that’s how these things work. [Inquirer]
*They also locked up Connor Bunnaman. So that’s cool and good. [BSH]
*We took a look back at Oskar Lindblom’s season which, all things considered, was pretty dang impressive. [BSH]
*And then the other big big news this weekend was Henrik Lundqvist’s announcement that he’ll be calling it a career. [Blueshirt Banter]
*Despite his being a real pain in the butt to play against for his entire career, you have to respect just how good he was. [NBC Sports Philly]
*And finally, if anyone has ever been a lock for the Hall of Fame upon retirement, it’s him. [Sportsnet]</span>

Some say the nerfs don’t go far enough, others wonder why a nerfed Seer is even worth having in the game
 Apex Legends’ latest update got players’ hopes up with news of a nerf to the shooter’s newest character, Seer, but the changes don’t go far enough on the newest Legend’s most disruptive ability.
The nerf takes out both the damage and the half-second, screen-blinding flash that opponents suffer when they’re hit with Seer’s “Focus of Attention” Tactical ability. But it still interrupts enemies who are healing themselves or reviving teammates. So Seer can continue playing havoc with opponents’ last-ditch defensive moves, much as the character has done since being introduced three weeks ago.

Mojang and Xbox Game Studios will bring the game to Valve’s store
 Minecraft Dungeons, the dungeon crawler inspired by Mojang’s classic survival game, is coming to Steam on Sept. 22. 
The base game will be available for purchase for $19.99 and the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game along with all six DLCs, will cost $39.99. Currently, the Windows PC version game is available for purchase on the Microsoft Store.
Minecraft Dungeons is a top-down action RPG game where you explore procedurally generated dungeons. (Think, Diablo but for kids.) Since its release in May 2020, Mojang and Xbox Game Studios have continued to release DLC that expands on the core game and bring new dungeons to explore. 
Three additional battle passes for the game — the Hero Edition, Hero Pass, and Season Pass — will be discounted from digital sales from Aug. 31 and will only be available in retail stores until stock runs out. Mojang and Xbox Games Studios said in a news release, “Players will still be able to purchase the same DLCs and in-game content, which will be available as part of the Standard Edition (game only) and Ultimate Edition (game and all six DLCs).”
Now, it’ll all come to Steam and give folks another way to purchase the game. Minecraft Dungeons is out now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

The alpha will be for PlayStation players only
 The latest Call of Duty won’t be released until November, but PlayStation players will have a chance to check the game out early during a multiplayer alpha for the game’s new Champion Hill mode. Call of Duty: Vanguard’s alpha will begin on Aug. 27 at 1 p.m. ET and end on Aug. 29 at 1 p.m. ET.
The alpha will focus on Vanguard’s new Champion Hill mode, in which duo (2v2) or trio (3v3) squads compete against each other in a round-robin tournament. Each team has individual lives that carry over from match to match, but when your team’s lives hit zero, you’re out. The last team standing wins. 
The mode also features an economy system that’s fairly new to the franchise. Every player in Champion Hill wil…</span>

A Left 4 Dead-alike that can’t blaze its own trail
 Before jumping into the second mission in Aliens: Fireteam Elite, I activated a challenge card that guaranteed a special alien to appear at least once. In exchange, this granted an XP multiplier — unfortunately, I had misread the second half of this mutator. Every 10 to 15 seconds the Drone, a Xenomorph with the ability to pin you down à la the Hunter in Left 4 Dead, appeared and terrorized my squad. It was so ridiculous that it became a running joke until we inevitably failed the mission. But in retrospect, this high risk/high reward situation made for a memorable moment, and I wish Aliens: Fireteam Elite was filled with more of them throughout.

                    <span>A Freudian adventure full of warmth, compassion, and humor
 Psychonauts 2 begins with the camera sweeping over the textured contours of a giant brain. At this scale, the complex organ looks topographical — every curve a hill in the landscape of the mind. The image reminded me of one of the more common editions of Sigmund Freud’s landmark The Interpretation of Dreams. The cover image depicted a pastoral scene of rolling green hills. Or was it a lady lying down, her back to us? Or a great bull dozing among the gentle slopes? The idea here, I gather, is that dreams and the unconscious mind in general, work metaphorically. Things are rarely as they seem, and one thing often stands in for another.



Of course, Freud and his psychoanalytic techniques have a troubled history. It turns out, when …</span>

In the latest publication of his Power On newsletter, Gurman writes that a new high-end ‌Mac mini‌, which has previously been reported to feature a new design with additional ports, can be expected to replace the current Intel ‌Mac mini‌ in &quot;the next several months.&quot; This presumably means the new ‌Mac mini‌ may launch alongside the redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros this fall.

                    <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching Apple&#x27;s busy product launch season, and rumors are continuing to fly. It sounds like Apple has enough products in the pipeline that it&#x27;ll need to hold multiple virtual events before the end of the year to introduce them all, so get ready for a flurry of activity over the next few months.







Other news this week included a fresh round of betas for iOS 15 and most of the associated operating system updates, reducing the update interval to one week as Apple finalizes things ahead of an expected September public launch. We also saw an interesting story of a &quot;double agent&quot; in the Apple leaker community, confirmation of a never-released &quot;iPhone nano&quot; thanks to an old email from Steve Jobs, and more.

Finally, no more uncertainty.
 After a long, arduous battle over the stipulations of his new contract this offseason, Travis Sanheim finally agreed to a new contract with the Flyers: two years at a $4.675 million AAV. This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.


Sanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.

      Sanheim’s three year player card.
  
The Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:
Barring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That&#x27;s the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can&#x27;t fit 23 without moving somebody out.
— Charlie O&#x27;Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021



With the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.</span>

Bungie won’t separate Destiny 2’s two main modes, and it’s starting to create problems
 Since the launch of Destiny 2, Bungie has struggled to maintain the balance between its PvE and PvP communities. The two camps have argued for years about whether Destiny should just be a PvE game or if it truly has room for competitive offerings. In the process, every player has lost out. Every time Bungie tries to make a new addition to the cooperative game, it’s hamstrung by multiplayer balancing — and vice versa.
Bungie’s devotion to both sides of the Destiny coin, while admirable, has resulted in an identity crisis. The studio likely won’t ever separate its PvP Crucible from its PvE cooperative activities. But if anything is clear, it’s that current attempts toward harmony a…</span>

Design Overhaul


The Weather app in ‌iOS 15‌ has an updated design that makes it easier than ever to see the information that you want to know at a glance. The Weather app adopts the card-style interface that&#x27;s also been used for the Settings app, separating different information into sections.

Tetris Beat features music from a diverse set of artists including Alison Wonderland, GARZA (of Thievery Corporation), Hannah Diamond, Octo Octa, Dauwd, CINTHIE, and more. There are 18 exclusive songs that span the dance, hip hop, and pop genres, with new music set to be introduced each month.

‌‌Apple Arcade‌‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.

                    <span>An Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula sold for $787,484 at auction this month after garnering 46 bids.





The 196 page manual was addressed to Julian Brewer, the son of Michael Brewer. Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. &quot;Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980,&quot; read Jobs&#x27; note.
Julian recalls, &quot;I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests. To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything, let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care.&quot;
RR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also auctioned off other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices. A Steve Jobs&#x27; letter that said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t sign autographs&quot; sold for $479,939, and a NeXTSTEP software package sold for $210,325.





A functional Apple-1 computer previously owned by Roger Wagner fetched $464,876, which is less than some prior Apple-1 computers have sold for. A signed 128K Macintosh Motherboard sold for $132,049, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for $94,949.





A copy of Macworld #1 that was signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold for $201,021, and a leather bomber jacket that was worn by Jobs in the 1983 &quot;middle finger to IBM&quot; photo sold for $66,466.

At the time, T-Mobile said that data from 7.8 million current customers had been compromised, as well as information from 40 million former or potential customers. In an updated statement provided today, T-Mobile says that it has confirmed that data from another 5.3 million postpaid customers was accessed.



Information accessed from these customers included names, addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, IMEIs, and IMSIs. The prior 7.8 million customers also saw their SSN and driver&#x27;s license information stolen.

                    <span>Documents highlighted by The Verge and disclosed as part of the Apple vs. Epic Games trial have revealed that Apple discussed plans for sideloading apps, sought to lock users into its ecosystem using gift cards, attempted to tackle chaos in the App Store review process, and more.





Several of the internal documents related to internal discussions around the possibility of sideloading iPhone apps outside of the ‌App Store‌. Some of these discussions may have gone further than expected, since in 2008, software chief Scott Forstall asked Steve Jobs what text should appear to iOS users when they want to open a sideloaded app. Jobs agreed to the following alert: &quot;Are you sure you want to open the application &#x27;Monkey Ball&#x27; from the developer &#x27;Sega&#x27;?&quot;

Apple has begun promoting and posting Today at Apple sessions on YouTube due to the global health crisis. The company was planning to bring back its session to its in-person retail stores at the end of this month; however, it has since decided differently due to the health crisis. The sessions cover photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil.

Jonanath Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University, as well as Anunay Kulshrestha, a researcher at Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy, both penned an op-ed for The Washington Post, outlining their experiences with building image detection technology.

The app, which first appeared on the App Store on August 9 without fanfare and was updated on August 18, allows users to voluntarily share their ‌Siri‌ interactions and feedback with Apple so that it can gain data to improve ‌Siri‌.



The app is reportedly available in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Taiwan, but does not show under the Utilities category where it is published, on the ‌App Store‌ charts, or via search. Users must have a direct link to the app to be able to find it on the ‌App Store‌.

Grid Studio, whose tagline is &quot;Every classic deserves to be framed,&quot; takes Apple products and breaks them down component-by-component, placing them in gorgeously labeled, neat, and organized frames for your home or office that beautifully respect the devices&#x27; intricate designs.



Grid Studio offers a selection of older-generation iPhones, with the most prized being the limited-edition original iPhone. Grid Studio is only offering 999 of the original iPhones in its frame collection, and each frame comes with a special plaque that let…</span>

                    <span>Blackmagic Design has announced a new update to its professional video editing and color correction software, DaVinci Resolve, that includes a new processing engine offering significantly better performance on Apple silicon Macs.





Thanks to the completely reworked engine, DaVinci Resolve 17.3 can work up to 3 times faster on Apple Mac models with the M1 chip, according to the company. The speed increase should make playback, editing, and grading of 4K and 8K projects faster using the software. 



The new processing engine also uses tile based rendering, which can give users on notebooks up to 30% longer battery when working in DaVinci Resolve.



In addition, version 17.3 supports a new option on Mac computers with ‌M1‌ for H.265 hardware encoding. It&#x27;s now possible to p…</span>

The new iPad will also equip with aluminum-alloy chassis that will be processed by PVD. The sources also revealed that Apple is also considering equipping iPads with titanium-based metal chassis, but the high costs for doing so may not be economical at the moment.

In a new paywalled report today, the publication states that Apple will &quot;host a series of product launch conferences in September,&quot; with a highlight of one of the events being the ninth generation baseline iPad.



Apple has multiple new products in store for release this fall, ranging from the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, third-generation AirPods, an updated iPad mini, a new baseline iPad, and of course, the highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros.

The interview, conducted in July, is in celebration of the Financial Review&#x27;s 70th anniversary. Cook begins the interview by sharing his morning routine, noting he likes to read emails from customers as it helps him keep a &quot;pulse on what customers are feeling.&quot;

Tim Cook likes to begin his days early; he&#x27;s at his desk by 4am. &quot;I do that because I can control the morning better than the evening and through the day.

                    <span>Twitter says it is rolling out a number of changes to the way direct messages work, including the ability to send a direct message to several people in different conversations. 





Going forward, Twitter says users will be able to share the same tweet in up to 20 separate direct message conversations, which should ensure &quot;no more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a tweet to multiple people.&quot;



Twitter says this change is rolling out on iOS and web over the next few weeks, with the changes coming &quot;soon&quot; on Android.



Twitter is also tweaking DM timestamps for iOS users in order to reduce &quot;timestamp clutter.&quot; Rather than having each message within a DM conversation stamped with the date and time, Messages will be grouped by day. 



In addition, the Twitter iOS app is gaining a couple of user interface tweaks, including a long-press gesture to access the &quot;add reaction&quot; buttons (previously only accessible via a double tap, and a new down-arrow button to return to the most recent message in a DM conversation after scrolling through.



Earlier this month, Twitter added support for Sign in With Apple, allowing new users to create an account using their Apple ID while hiding their true email address from the social network.

Apple had previously planned to return to in-person work by early September, but the company delayed that timeline until October. Now, due to continued concerns, that timeframe has been further pushed back until at least January. 



In a memo sent to staff, obtained by Bloomberg, the company&#x27;s human resource and retail chief, Deirdre O’Brien, said that Apple is not planning to close its offices or retail stores that are currently open, but is encouraging employees to get vaccinated.

Philadelphia has locked up an RFA for a couple of seasons.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to work through their depth this summer and most recently, have brought back a familiar face to keep that dearth of mid-20’s forwards active.
Announced by the team on Friday, the Flyers have re-signed center Connor Bunnaman to a two-year deal that will have a two-way salary structure for the first season to a one-way deal in the second. Other than a league-minimum NHL salary of $750,000, further financial details have not been disclosed by the club.

 When you talk about perseverance, heart, character, and toughness, look no further than Flyers winger Oskar Lindblom. 
After battling a rare form of bone cancer that robbed him of what was a breakout 2019-20 season, Lindblom did the unthinkable — returning that very season to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Given what a tremendous battle Lindblom was facing, truly remarkable stuff that he was able to work his way into play shape after losing a ton of weight undergoing treatment for Ewing’s sarcoma.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The City of Glendale has had quite enough of the crap coming from the Coyotes’ billionaire ownership. They called their bluff and are booting them from the arena. That’s wild. [Five For Howling]
*Anyhoo, the Flyers. This summer saw the most action, roster-wise, in a very long time. Remember the last time the team made such wholesale change? [NBC Sports Philly]
*We chatted with our pals at The Cannon about their newest addition, and our recent subtraction. [The Cannon]
*The Golden Knights are hanging some hopes on Nolan Patrick. Oh, those sweet summer children. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Owen Power has elected to go back to college rather than join the Sabres which... yeah, kid. Good choice. [Die By The Blade]
*A lot of fans are mad about the jerseys on the ads, but we’ve been here before, folks. And it was fine. [The Province]
*But yeah, here’s a deep dive on how the NHL came to the decision to bring advertisements to the hockey jerseys. [ESPN]
*And finally, speaking jersey ads... that’s the focus of a brand new episode of Flyperbole! Well, as much as an episode of Flyperbole can have a focus. [BSH]</span>

The first update to Inazuma hits in September 
 Genshin Impact’s giant update, The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia, is getting more content on Sept. 1. 
The 2.1 update, “Floating World Under the Moonlight,” will bring the main storyline in Inazuma to a close, and add new characters, additional boss fights, and two new islands to explore. And fishing is coming to Teyvat. (Everybody’s doing it!)
Genshin Impact developer Mihoyo released a trailer teasing some of the 2.1 content on Friday. It showed combat gameplay from new characters and a cinematic of Scaramouche laughing maniacally as the Traveler falls to the ground and blacks out — suggesting some sort of confrontation between the two. 
The update will bring new playable characters, including fan favorite Raiden Shogun (the Electro Archon also known as Baal) and Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy. Aloy will join the Genshin Impact cast in the 2.1 update as a free five-star archer, but comes first to those with PlayStation consoles via early access. Aloy and Shogun will be joined by Sangonomiya Kokomi, a five-star who wields the power of Hydro and is a catalyst, and Kujou Sara, a ranged attacker with Electro attacks.  
As for fishing, Mihoyo said in a news release that “players can soon go angling for a variety of fishes across the continent of Teyvat,” which can be used to produce fish meat of exchange for rewards.</span>

The announcement was made Friday in a video update by 343 Industries
 Halo Infinite won’t launch with two of the franchise’s most desirable features. Developers at 343 Industries said Friday that campaign co-op and the multiplayer map-editing Forge mode won’t be available when the game arrives. Forge in particular will lag behind “about six months.” The announcement was made on YouTube.
“Unfortunately as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,” Staten said, “and we also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.”
343 announced one year ago that Halo Infinite would miss its original 2020 launch window, delaying the game into 2021. It still has no firm release date. On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.
Staten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.
“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”
Co-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning. Forge mode, which allows players to build their own multiplayer levels and game modes and share them online, was introduced with Halo 3 in 2007.</span>

Loads of new changes and decisions in a staple mode don’t seem like a lot, until they do
 Every year, Madden NFL seems to have a glaringly neglected mode. The great news — the best news — about Madden NFL 22: That mode is Madden Ultimate Team.
For once, MUT is the mode that goes begging. For once, Madden Ultimate Team is the mode that gets a maintenance-level update from last year. Good! Madden lifers have long resented MUT, for all its microtransactions and monetization, accusing it of sucking up what little oxygen a year’s development cycle leaves, while core features and gameplay are left gasping and semi-conscious. But for Madden NFL 22, EA Tiburon stood pat on MUT, and that alone is a message to the community, just as much as the Franchise m…</span>

Play on a selection of rotating maps in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Rotating Maps
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock class item)
5 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock helmet)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, in the Hangar, standing on the back steps.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:

One-Eyed Mask, Titan helmet: 23 Legendary Shards
Sanguine Alchemy, Warlock chest: 23 Legendary Shards

Season of the Lost is one of Destiny 2’s biggest non-expansion updates in years
 Destiny 2’s upcoming Season of the Lost will see some major weapon changes. Players will not only get their hands on non-Exotic Stasis weapons for the first time, they’ll also see unlimited ammo for primary weapons and a host of potent Exotic changes.
In a blog post ahead of its Destiny Showcase on Tuesday, where players will learn all about season 15 and next year’s The Witch Queen expansion, Bungie detailed those Stasis weapons. Legendary Stasis weapons will go in either the Power slot — reserved for rocket launchers, drum-fed grenade launchers, swords, linear fusion rifles, and machine guns — or the kinetic slot.

Bungie revealed that Season of the Lost will start this Tuesday
 The name and art for Destiny 2’s 15th season leaked Thursday night, and Bungie officially confirmed it on Friday morning. Season of the Lost, starring Mara Sov, will start on Tuesday, Aug. 24, immediately following Bungie’s Destiny Showcase. The developer will reveal the new season and the upcoming The Witch Queen expansion during the livestream.
Normally, a simple season name and the reveal of its main characters only serve to hype players up. But Season of the Lost’s name and Mara’s involvement bring a certain weight: Both details appear in a major, months-old leak. With Bungie’s confirmation, one of the biggest rumors in the series’ history just got a lot more credible.

                    <span>For the New Yorker, the novelist Donald Antrim wrote about wanting to die by suicide and being saved by electroconvulsive therapy: Finding a Way Back from Suicide.
I had survived, or thought that I’d survived, my parents’ drinking and shouting, our constant moving, the losses of places and friends, annihilation after annihilation. I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother. None of this had stopped my dying. Writing had not stopped my dying. The Twelve Steps had not stopped my dying. Therapy hadn’t stopped it, and my old friends couldn’t stop it; nor could Regan. No one could.

                    <span>I’ve been a bit obsessed recently with urban architecture that incorporates nature &amp; greenery into the mix, especially since seeing the technique employed so creatively in Singapore last year, so this new book called Evergreen Architecture is tickling that fancy right now.
As more of the earth’s surface is swallowed up by the built environment, architects are increasingly advised to integrate urban flora and fauna into their designs. Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.
Embracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?


You can order the book from Bookshop. (via colossal)

Here’s a short video of Tanaka at work on his miniatures:

                    <span>The United States Federal Trade Commission today reinforced its antitrust case against Facebook by providing more detail on how the company either crushed or bought out its rivals in an attempt to get rid of competition.





The updated filing is longer than the original complaint and it offers additional evidence in favor of the FTC&#x27;s argument that Facebook is a monopolist, plus it again asks the judge overseeing the case to force Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, the two social networking apps that Facebook also operates.



In the complaint, the FTC says that Facebook used an illegal &quot;buy-or-bury&quot; scheme to maintain its dominance in the social networking market after it failed to &quot;develop innovative mobile features&quot; during the transition from desktop to mobile devices.…</span>

                    <span>Major features like SharePlay, Safari updates, Photos changes, and more have received most of the attention when it comes to iOS 15 coverage, but there are some notable new translation-related features that are being introduced in the update.

System-Wide Translation


Apple in iOS 14 introduced a new Translate app that can be used to translate conversations from one language to another, and also added translation features to Safari.





In ‌iOS 15‌, translation capabilities are expanding further and can be used system-wide. You can select any…</span>

                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is making a major push into electric vehicle manufacturing and has long been aiming to get into the vehicle market, according to a new profile of Foxconn&#x27;s car ambitions that was shared by Nikkei.





&quot;If we can make iPhones, why can&#x27;t we make EVs?&quot; Foxconn founder and former chairman Terry Gou said in an internal meeting. &quot;It is an iPhone with four wheels.&quot;



Foxconn has been pursuing electric vehicles since 2014 when there was an &quot;A-Fu Initiative&quot; to build an electric vehicle prototype. That project ultimately folded because of the complexity of creating a car, but Foxconn is once again building up a vehicle supply chain with plans to get into EV manufacturing.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/apple-closes-store-in-south-carolina/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has temporarily shut down its retail store located in Charleston, South Carolina after more than 20 staff members were exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, reports Bloomberg.





According to the website for the store, it will be shuttered until Monday, August 23. According to Bloomberg, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.



Apple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.



Continuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple&#x27;s store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then reinstated mask mandates at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.



Apple had also planned to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since pushed back those plans because of the prevalence of the delta variant.

                    <span>With the introduction of iOS 15, Apple rebadged its paid iCloud plans to &quot;‌iCloud‌+&quot; to reflect the fact that subscribers now get access to additional privacy features like Private Relay and Hide My Email. This article explains what Hide My Email is and how to use it.





Hide My Email builds on the idea of Sign in With Apple by providing you with unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox whenever you want to keep your personal email address private. 



It&#x27;s especially useful if you suspect that a business you&#x27;re transacting with is likely to share your email address with ad agencies or other third-parties for marketing purposes. Using a random email address means you can delete the address at any time, ensuring unsolicited emails don&#x27;t reach your inbox…</span>

                    <span>Nanoleaf today announced the addition of Thread Border Router technology to the Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements Controllers, with the functionality available through a firmware update in the Nanoleaf app.





With the Nanoleaf Border Router, Nanoleaf Essentials devices will be able to connect to the Thread network automatically when the Shapes or Elements Controller is connected to WiFi.



Nanoleaf is also partnering with Eero for similar capabilities. The Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 will function as Border Routers with the Nanoleaf Essentials line. Eero will expand compatibility with other products in the future.



Nanoleaf is one of the first companies bringing Thread Border Routers to the HomeKit network, making Thread technology available to other Thread-based smart home devices.



Thread technology is designed to improve the smart home networking and usage experience. Thread is a networking protocol designed for smart home products, and it offers improved connectivity, reliability, and range compared to the single connection points of Bluetooth and WiFi. Border Router technology connects a Thread network to another network like WiFi and is essential for the Thread system.



With Thread Border Router functionality built into the Nanoleaf Shapes Controller, Elements Controller, and Eero routers, there is no need for an extra hub because these devices serve as a bridge to connect the WiFi network and the Thread network together.

                    <span>Apple is researching a MacBook keyboard that features a removable key to be used as a precision mouse, according to a newly published patent application.

                    <span>Apple TV+ today shared the official trailer for highly-anticipated sci-fi series &quot;Foundation&quot; ahead of its premiere on September 24.






Based on the best-selling novels by Isaac Asimov, Apple says &quot;Foundation&quot; is an epic saga chronicling a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.
When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari&#x27;s claims, the ruling Cleons – a long line of emperor clones – fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they&#x27;re forced to reckon with the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.
&quot;Foundation&quot; stars Emmy Award nominees Jared Harris and Lee Pace, alongside Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch.



The first episode of &quot;Foundation&quot; will be released on Apple TV+ on September 24, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday. Series writer and showrunner David Goyer hopes to tell the story over the course of 80 episodes.



Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a free seven-day trial available, or a longer trial available with the purchase of select new Apple products.

Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, said:
It is exciting to be recognized with this first J.D. Power win, just two years after introducing Apple Card in 2019 and the first time being included in this study. We designed Apple Card to help our customers lead healthier financial lives, so it&#x27;s incredibly meaningful to see that our customers are valuing this. Being recognized as the leader in this category this year is an honor, and we look forward to continuing to deliver this product, service, and support with our award-winning issuer as Apple Card expands to more and more customers across the U.S.




The ‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a no-fee credit card designed for the iPhone and supported by Goldman Sachs, featuring Apple Wallet integration and Daily Cash rewards with up to three percent cashback. The card is only available in the United States.

The images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn&#x27;t very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.



One interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It&#x27;s also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. 



Reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros.

                    <span>An international coalition of more than 90 policy and rights groups published an open letter on Thursday urging Apple to abandon its plans to &quot;build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads, and other products&quot; – a reference to the company&#x27;s intention to scan users&#x27; iCloud photo libraries for images of child sex abuse (via Reuters).




&quot;Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,&quot; the groups wrote in the letter.

                    <span>As the back-to-school season kicks in, Apple plans to update its baseline iPad this fall with a new ninth-generation model tailored towards students, sporting a thinner design and an improved processor, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





In September of last year, Apple updated the baseline iPad with the faster and more powerful A12 Bionic chip starting at $329, or $299 for education customers. The baseline update sits at the lower end of the ‌iPad‌ lineup and is tailored for customers needing an affordable ‌iPad‌ for day-to-day use.



For the 9th generation model, Apple is likely to continue with the current design featuring Touch ID and a Home Button. The updated model will feature a faster processor with improved performance and graphics and a thinner form factor.



The updated ‌iPad‌ joins a busy fall season for Apple, as the company is also expected to be preparing a more significant update to the iPad mini. The new iPad mini is rumored to feature a larger display with smaller bezels, improved performance, and an updated overall design. Apple is also preparing new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros for launch in the coming months.

                    <span>Apple this evening began offering refurbished versions of the 24-inch M1 iMac in its U.S. online store, one day after starting to sell refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs in the UK.





Apple has over a dozen ‌M1‌ iMacs available at the current time, and this is the first time the ‌M1‌ iMacs have been available through the refurbished store in the U.S. since the machines launched in April.



The entry-level model with 8-core GPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD is available for $1,099, which is a $200 discount from the regular price of $1,299.



Apple also has higher-end refurbished models available for purchase, up to an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU option with a 1TB SSD and 16GB RAM, which is available for $1,779. At full price, the machine would cost $2,099.



There are multiple color options and configurations available at the current time, though stock will fluctuate going forward based on the machines that people are sending Apple for repairs and returns.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌iMac‌, plus they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

                    <span>Rueben Martell’s Don’t Say Its Name opens with a hit and run. Kharis (Sheena Kaine), a young Indigenous woman, is walking on a back road when she’s struck and killed. Her assailant isn’t seen, but her death has immediate ramifications that extend far beyond her grieving mother Mary Lynne (Carla Fox); it winds up affecting […]</span>

                    <span>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about why I explain things the way I do. The
usual way I write is:
Try to learn a topic
Read a bunch of explanations that I find confusing
Eventually understand the topic
Write an explanation that makes sense to me, to help others
So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find
out! I came up with a list of 12 patterns that make explanations hard for me to
understand. For each pattern I’ll also explain what I like to do instead to
avoid the issue.
these patterns are very normal
This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at
least one of them while writing this post!
But knowing that I’m likely to accidently do these t…</span>

Nightborne and Lightforged Draenei get a treat
 When World of Warcraft: Shadowlands launched, there was with a buffet of character customization options for humans, night elves, orcs, and undead. However, a few of the races — especially the game’s Allied Races, which don’t have their own starting zone and can only be unlocked in the end game — fell a little short. Blizzard stated that they would not be revisiting the issue during Shadowlands, but it looks like that’s about to change. On Thursday, a community manager shared the following information on the official Blizzard forums.
Our characters in game are a virtual representation of who we are in Azeroth and having more character customization options to design our characters helps us feel closer to…</span>

The anniversary edition arrives Nov. 11
 Bethesda announced a new edition of the fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim on Thursday, during QuakeCon at Home 2021. Skyrim is about to turn 10, which is a very momentous anniversary indeed, and the new Anniversary Edition will have some nice bonuses for players. 
Skyrim’s Anniversary Edition will be available for players on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The Anniversary Edition contains the full game, all enhancements from the Special Edition, and the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions.
The game comes with a free next-gen console upgrade, over 500 Creation Club elements like quests, dungeons, bosses, and weapons.  Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.
It’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands. The Elder Scrolls 6 remains elusive, but fans will be able to tuck into Skyrim once again and enjoy all of their old quests — as well as a new spin, thanks to fishing.</span>

Plus, you can date weapons
 The sincerity with which developer Kitfox Games enters into Boyfriend Dungeon is contagious. It’d otherwise be easy to write the game off as a joke, a concept that’s wacky just to be wacky. I mean, it’s a dating simulator in which you date people that can turn into weapons, which can then be used to fight through monstrous dungeons. But it’s a concept that’s executed in earnest, with thoughtfulness and care grounding the otherwise implausible world. It was easy to just go with it. So yeah, the game is about dating people that you’ll also use as weapons to fight your insecurities. What of it?

Black Panther absorbs attacks 
 Marvel’s Avengers’ version of Black Panther is impervious to most attacks, and it makes him as kinetic to play as his MCU counterpart is to watch.
The first expansion for Marvel’s Avengers, War for Wakanda, hit the game earlier this week and added Black Panther to the list of playable heroes. With the roster up to nine Avengers, making the heroes stand out is key to the games’ success. But Black Panther has some defensive abilities that make him a blast to play. 
There are three different varieties of enemy attacks in Marvel’s Avengers: light attacks, strong attacks, and unblockable attacks. For strong attacks, players either need to time a parry to avoid damage or dodge out of the way. And as you might expect, un…</span>

Plus a new Quake expansion pack
 Three Quake games — Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena — are now available through Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft announced the additions on Thursday alongside the start of QuakeCon 2021, shortly after id Software revealed and released a remastered version of the original Quake.
Quake’s enhanced version is available on Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Xbox Game Pass, while Quake 2 and Quake 3: Arena can be played on Windows PC through the subscription service “in their original form.” In other words, Quake 2 and Quake 3 haven’t been remastered. Players looking to enjoy Quake 2 in prettier form should check out the free Quake 2 RTX release, pictured above.
Bethesda Software’s remastered Quake, a new version of the 25-year-old game, has 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames. It’s also available on its own on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (and PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility), and Windows PC.
The three Quake games join a lineup that includes more than 30 Bethesda Softworks-published titles, many of which were added to Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda.</span>

The original Colors is from 2010, but this animation is all new
 Sonic Colors: Ultimate is an upcoming remaster of the original Wii platformer, and Sega has released a cartoon for players who need a refresher on the game’s lore. “Rise of the Wisps” is a two-part animation, and the first part was released on Thursday. Directed by Tyson Hesse, the artist behind Sonic Mania Adventures, Rise of the Wisps tells the story of Sonic, Tails, and one Jade Wisp, who needs help taking down Dr. Eggman.
The animations and cartoons surrounding Sonic releases are some of the best hedgehog-related content in years. Even if you’re not a fan of the games themselves, it’s nice to see that Tails, Sonic and company are still up to their old hijinks. While the upcoming Part 2 of Rise of the Wisps will probably have much more action, Part 1 helps set the scene, and it includes some fun exchanges between Tails, the Jade Wisp, and Sonic.
The next mainline game in the Sonic series is currently planned for 2022, and is a 3D game, although details are otherwise light. Sonic Colors: Ultimate is set to release on Sept. 7 on the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

id Software classic gets 4K/60 fps support and new expansion from MachineGames
 Bethesda Softworks released a remastered version of the original Quake, the landmark first-person shooter id Software published 25 years ago, on Thursday. The new version of Quake includes 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a brand-new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames.
The remastered Quake is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One, and is playable through backward compatibility on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. On PC, Steam and Bethesda Launcher users who already own Quake will automatically receive the new version with a free download. 
In terms of visuals, players can expect improved lighting and models, dynamic shadows, motion blur, and anti-aliasing. The game’s score, produced by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor, is also included. Expansion packs Scourge of Armagon, Dissolution of Eternity, and Dimension of the Past (the new, MachineGames-created add-on), are now included as part of the standard Quake package. More details are available at Bethesda’s announcement.
The original Quake, which launched in the summer of 1996, was id’s successor to the Doom series. Although it, too, launched as a single-player FPS with a campaign, it became much more popular as a multiplayer arena shooter. It was followed by four sequels between 1997 and 2007.
Bethesda acquired id Software and its franchises in 2009, but the only Quake title published since then is 2017’s Quake Champions on Windows PC, which is now a free-to-play game.</span>

But maybe a good game isn’t the point
 Fortnite’s new Impostors event is simple: Ten players enter a station, but two of them are impostors. The innocent crew members need to complete a series of tasks around the map without getting murdered — or at least while catching the murderer as quickly as possible. Yes, there’s no way around it: It’s Among Us. 
Among Us’ gameplay loop is simple and lean; Fortnite’s Imposters clutters it up. Impostors is visually busy and crowded, and it’s not just because everyone has their fancy 3D model with custom skins and emotes attached. It’s hard to see myself playing it with family members, much less politicians using it as a public outreach tool.

Health regen is back
 Call of Duty: Vanguard will bring the series back to World War II. But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.
During a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.
“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”
Call of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division; Captain Wade Jackson, from the U.S.’s Scouting Squadron Six; and Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs of Australia’s 20th Battalion. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s preview.
At the same time that Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

Vanguard Zombies will tie into Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies mode
 Treyarch’s Call of Duty Zombies modes are usually limited to the games the studio develops itself, but that’s not the case this time around. During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.
Treyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. 
Treyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map. It’s unclear if the Zombies mode in Vanguard will continue Treyarch’s Black Ops storyline or be something entirely separate. 
Call of Duty: Vanguard will be released on Nov. 5. Activision and Treyarch hasn’t announced if the Zombies mode will arrive when the game launches or sometime after. 
At the same time Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

                    <span>Americans are collectively almost $15 trillion in debt, most of it related to housing (i.e. mortgage debt). For the New Yorker, Margaret Talbot shares some images from Brittany Powell’s The Debt Project, a series of 99 portraits of Americans in debt.
Powell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan “We are the ninety-nine per cent”) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”


The Debt Project is also available in book form.

It is eerie and weird and uncanny and all other such adjectives watching these machines smoothly caper around like humans. Even in the blooper reel they seem really toddler-esque.

                    <span>Jumbo the Elephant was one of the most famous animals in the world. Bought as a calf in Sudan by a European animal dealer in 1860, Jumbo found fame first at the London Zoo and later as the centerpiece of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in the US. Jumbo was so beloved in London that news of his sale to P.T. Barnum prompted 100,000 children to write to Queen Victoria, urging her to nix the deal. In the video above, Andrew McClellan recounts Jumbo’s too-short (and probably unhappy) life and the impact he had on society.
The word “jumbo” hadn’t been known or used in the English language before he came along and has since become the byword for anything humongous or supersized. So every time we use the word “jumbo jet” or “jumbotron”, we’re actually referring back to Jumbo the elephant.

                    <span>Juli Clover, again:
Apple in iOS 15 beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari
address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to
an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes
introduced in earlier betas.
Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled
on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and
the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control
panel that does away with trying to merge all page management
options into a single address bar view.
I was a little worried when beta 5 shipped last week and Safari’s interface was unchanged, but beta 6’s changes are very good.
The initial iOS Safari 15 design failed in two big ways. First and foremost, Apple tried to squeeze two horizontal bars’ worth of cont…</span>

Netflix is rolling out support for Spatial Audio on the iPhone and
the iPad, based on reports shared by MacRumors readers
and on Reddit. A Netflix spokesperson also confirmed to
MacRumors that the rollout is underway.
When you’re watching a movie on an iPhone or iPad, spatial audio is a  game changer for degree of immersiveness. Henceforth when preloading a movie or two for a plane trip, I’ll favor titles with spatial audio support. It really helps make up for the small screen by having big immersive sound.
Not surprised that Netflix is adding support sooner rather than later — one thing Netflix gets right is they want viewers to be happy. Spatial audio makes me happy.

*The dev camp participant list is looking pretty good top to bottom, honestly. Should be fun to watch, if we can go. [Inquirer]
*Robert Hagg, good luck out there buddy. You had a good season on your way out the door. [BSH]
*Cam Atkinson seems to bring a lot to the table, but there are two specific ways he should be able to help the Flyers in a big way this season. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers’ most recently drafted goalie doesn’t crack to top ten, but he got darn close. [The Athletic]
*Yesterday we learned, officially, that jersey advertisements are coming to the NHL this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, with that news being reports, we couldn’t help but wonder: whose logo should make its way onto the Flyers’ orange and black? [BSH]</span>

                    <span>Johnny Cirillo photographs people on the streets of New York in the style of paparazzi (half a block away with a long lens) and posts them, with permission, to his Instagram account. From an interview with Cirillo in Vogue:
I decided early-on that if I was going to shoot candids of New Yorkers, I didn’t want it to be with a wide lens, up-close in their faces. I started using a 200mm lens so that I could be half a city block away from the subject. It’s similar to the way paparazzi shoot, and all my subjects are celebrities to me, so it’s fitting in that respect.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the fifth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

                    <span>Apple released the sixth beta of iOS 15 just a week after the fifth beta, but the new update brings some of the most significant tweaks that we&#x27;ve seen to ‌iOS 15‌ during the beta testing period.





Safari Redesign


Apple in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes introduced in earlier betas.





Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control panel that does away with trying to merge all page management options into a single address bar view.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/google-5g-low-cost-pixel-5a-smartphone/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple&#x27;s $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.





Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple&#x27;s cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.



In addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple&#x27;s upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that&#x27;s &quot;roughly the same&quot; as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.



Other Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple&#x27;s playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.



Apple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update for the Siri Remote designed for the new Apple TV 4K and ‌Apple TV‌ HD models. The new firmware has an internal version number of 9M6772, while the prior firmware version was 9M6336. Note that this is not the firmware version that you see in the ‌Apple TV‌ Remote settings. 





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s new with the ‌Apple TV‌ remote update, but it likely addresses minor bugs and performance issues. 



Apple has not detailed how to install a firmware update for the ‌Siri‌ Remote, but it&#x27;s likely similar to AirPods, delivered silently and over the air while the ‌Apple TV‌ is asleep. Firmware updates are installed in the background and it may take some time for the ‌Siri‌ Remote update to be downloaded and installed.

                    <span>Tweetbot 6 designed for the iPhone and the iPad today received a major update, with Tapbots introducing several significant new features that are designed to make the app experience better than ever.





There&#x27;s now a Tweetbot 6 widget that can be added to the Today View or the Home Screen, and it shows the Twitter timeline. A single tweet can be shown in the smallest widget view, but there are also larger options that show more tweets at a glance.



When using the Tweetbot 6 update on iOS devices, there&#x27;s now support for Handoff, so you can resume what you were doing on one device on another device using the built-in Handoff feature. Handoff does not yet work on the Mac, but support will be added later.



Tweetbot 6 now supports Shortcuts so Tweetbot actions can be used in the shortcuts created on iOS devices, plus on the ‌iPad‌, multiple Tweetbot windows are now supported for multitasking purposes. There are also additional app icons to choose from.



Tweetbot 6 can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but a subscription costs $5.99 per year or $0.99 per month. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has renewed &quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; for a fifth season, and with the renewal, the TV show will be migrating from Apple Music to Apple TV+. &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; could be watched through the ‌Apple Music‌ app or the Apple TV app, but it has not previously been a part of ‌Apple TV+‌ and limited to ‌Apple TV+‌ subscribers.





Based on the &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; segment of the &quot;The Late Late Show With James Corden,&quot; Apple&#x27;s version of &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been available since 2017.



Filming on &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic, according to Deadline, but efforts are underway to begin production once again.



&quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; brings various actors, athletes, and musicians together to chat and sing popular songs with one another. The fourth season of the show featured pairings like Maya Rudolph and Haim, Keegan-Michael Key and Rob Gronkowski, and the &quot;Shark Tank&quot; sharks.



There&#x27;s no word yet on which celebrities will be featured in the fifth season of the show.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s next Apple Watch Activity Challenge is set to take place on Saturday, August 28th, in celebration of national parks worldwide.





Apple will ask Apple Watch owners to complete a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile to earn a special National Parks award.
Let&#x27;s take a day to appreciate the beauty of national parks all over the world. On August 28, earn this award by recording a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6K) or more with any app that adds workouts to Health.
As with all Activity Challenges, the award will be accompanied by animated stickers that can be used in the Messages app.

















Apple always celebrates national parks in August, and last year introduced an Apple Pay donation program and highlighted Apple TV+ content, Apple Music songs, podcasts, books, and more all focused on national parks.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 introduced a new Safari experience that moves the URL bar and tab interface to the bottom of the iPhone, a decision that has been controversial with ‌iPhone‌ users.




Safari options in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6


Throughout the beta testing period, Apple has been tweaking the design of the Safari browser on the ‌iPhone‌ and in beta 6, there are further refinements. The bottom tab bar has been redesigned to appear below page content, and Apple has also added a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom.




The original design in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5


The addition of a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the Safari interface returns Safari to a more iOS 14-like experience, walking back many of the ‌iOS 15‌ changes.





With the bottom view option toggled on, Safari offers a dedicated toolbar with buttons at the bottom of the interface, which is also an improvement over the prior floating design.



Apple has also introduced new setting options to remove the website tinting and to enable a Tab Bar while in landscape mode. There was previously a &quot;Show Color in Tab Bar&quot; accessibility setting, which appears to be the same as the new &quot;Allow Website Tinting&quot; toggle.  



Apple previously added similar toggles in iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey to offer either a separate tab bar (which was the original default when the betas launched) or a merged tab bar, which is more similar to the previous design.

                    <span>In the beta notes for the sixth updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15, Apple says that the FaceTime SharePlay feature has been disabled for future beta releases and will not be available to use when the updates initially launch this fall. 





Apple will instead make SharePlay available in an update to ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey that&#x27;s coming later this year. 



With SharePlay being removed temporarily, Apple is offering an alternative tool for developers to test SharePlay development features, and a SharePlay profile is available for developers to download. 
SharePlay has been disabled for use in iOS and iPadOS 15 developer beta 6 and will be disabled for use in its initial release this fall. SharePlay will be enabled for use again in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall. To continue your development, we have provided a SharePlay Development Profile which will enable successful creation and reception of GroupSessions via the Group Activities API.
With SharePlay, ‌FaceTime‌ users can share their screens with one another, watch movies and TV shows in sync together, listen to music and contribute to a group playlist, and more.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Refurbished 24-inch M1 iMac models are now available from Apple&#x27;s refurbished store in the UK, just a few months after the machines first launched in April.





Right now, Apple has one 24-inch iMac available in a pink color, which was first spotted by 9to5Mac. The machine features an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD and it is priced at £1,059, a £190.00 savings over the standard £1,249 price.



Refurbished stock varies based on what people have sent in for repair and replacement, and additional ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ models will be available in the future. Those looking for a specific build or a specific color will need to keep an eye on the store to wait for their preferred version to pop up.



All of Apple&#x27;s refurbished Macs are sold with the same one-year warranty that&#x27;s offered with a new Mac, plus they come with all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C power adapter and cable. Apple&#x27;s refurbished devices are subjected to a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging and cleaning process to make them identical to new devices.



Categories for refurbished 24-inch iMacs have also shown up in the United States, so we can expect to see the refurbished ‌iMac‌ models available in other countries in the near future.

                    <span>Apple has developed a first-of-its-kind hydration sensor designed for the Apple Watch, a company patent filing has revealed.





The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled &quot;Hydration measurement with a watch&quot; and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



&quot;Traditional techniques for tracking hydration are generally invasive, expensive, or unreliable,&quot; according to Apple. This refers to existing ways of determining hydration such as single-use tests of fluid samples.



Apple&#x27;s hydration sensor takes the form of non-invasive electrodes that are placed against the skin, which it describes as a &quot;reliable and elegant&quot; solution. The sensor works by measuring the electrical properties of the Apple Watch wearer&#x27;s sweat. The patent explains:

                    <span>Mastercard last week announced that its cards will no longer be issued with the magnetic stripe by 2029, which will presumably include Apple Card.





The magnetic stripe was an early 1960s technology that allowed card information to be encoded onto magnetic tape that is laminated to the back of a card, paving the way for electronic payment terminals and chip cards. Now, Mastercard is set to be the first payments network to phase out the magnetic stripe.



Starting in 2024, Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to feature a magnetic stripe in most markets, including Europe. Banks in the United States will no longer be required to issue cards with a magnetic stripe in 2027. Mastercard expects that the magnetic stripe will disappear in Europe most quickly, where …</span>

                    <span>The Apple Watch Edition with titanium for the Series 6 is currently entirely unavailable for purchase on Apple&#x27;s online store, following some models being unavailable for delivery or pick-up earlier this month.





On August 1, select models of the Series 6 Edition with titanium were unavailable for delivery and/or pick-up. Now, all titanium models are unavailable for delivery or pick-up and can&#x27;t even be added to Apple&#x27;s online store bag.



The unavailability comes just weeks ahead of when we expect Apple to announce the Apple Watch Series 7 with a new design. Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has speculated that the spotty lack of availability for the Apple Watch Edition earlier this month could entail Apple deciding to discontinue the higher-end lineup with the Series 7.



We&#x27;ve contacted Apple for comment and will let MacRumors&#x27; readers know if we hear back.

                    <span>Adobe today announced several new updates for its Photoshop apps available for the Mac and the iPad. Photoshop for ‌iPad‌ is gaining Healing Brush and Magic Wand features, bringing it in line with Photoshop for the desktop.





Photoshop for ‌iPad‌ was first introduced in 2019, and at launch, the tablet version of the software was lacking several features that were available in the Mac version of Photoshop. Adobe at launch said that new capabilities would be added to Photoshop for ‌iPad‌ over time, and since then, new features have been introduced on a regular basis.



With the Healing Brush, ‌iPad‌ users will be able to correct imperfections, with the tool matching texture, lighting, transparency, and other details. The Magic Wand tool is available for selecting irregularly sh…</span>

                    <span>The upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature flat edges, a larger display thanks to smaller bezels, and a more prominent speaker, according to new CAD renders, allegedly obtained from industry sources, shared today by 91mobiles.





The renders reveal an updated Apple Watch design that takes inspiration from the flat-edges of the iPhone 12, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and the upcoming 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros. From the renders, we can see that the rear of the Apple Watch will consist of the same configuration of health sensors as the current Series 6.



The renders reveal no significant design changes to the Digital Crown or side button; however, they show two speakers that extend the entire side of the Apple Watch compared to the current adjacent speaker design. According to dime…</span>

“We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data
occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any
personal customer data involved,” T-Mobile wrote in its new
announcement. “This investigation will take some time but we are
working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have
completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of
records affected or the validity of statements made by others,”
the announcement added.
The seller told Motherboard that 100 million people had their data
compromised in the breach. In the forum post, they were offering
data on 30 million people for 6 bitcoin, or around $270,000.

What can I say, this is a flashback to the roots of the genre. The guys managed to create material with old spirit, sound, and riffs.

But if you&#x27;ve been holding out on buying it for some reason, now is the time to purchase. The 50% off sale will end Monday, August 23rd, and the price will double from $19.99 up to $39.99 USD.
The bundle discount will still be available though. So if you buy multiple copies (or multiple apps), you can save some cash. Or buy now and save even more.</span>

The jersey ads are coming; whose money will the Flyers end up taking? 
 It leaked earlier today that, despite Gary Bettman’s assurances to the contrary last year, the NHL will finally give in to the corporate gods whose money and influence rules us all and sell advertising space on NHL jerseys for the upcoming season. 
From ESPN’s report on the story: 
The league’s board of governors formally voted this month to approve jersey advertisements. The NHL had surveyed its teams and found the majority of them in favor of jersey ads. The ads will be featured in a 3-inch-by-3.5-inch rectangle, which is larger than the NBA’s 2.5-by-2.5-inch space for uniform ads.

This is, of course, the second foray into selling advertising space on the players’…</span>

So long, farewell, etc, etc. 
 The time has come, folks. Lengthy, tumultuous, and often divisive, the Robert Hagg saga has come to an end in Philadelphia. As part of the return for Buffalo in the trade that brought Rasmus Ristolainen to the Flyers, this awful and messy 2020-21 season was Hagg’s last with them, and in a lot of ways it was a solid individual final showing, and serves as a positive endnote and send-off. 



Really, we’re not being snarky, we promise. Let’s break it down, shall we?

Hagg’s not one that we’ve known to put up stellar scoring numbers, but he can chip in a bit of offense when push comes to shove. That said, his scoring pace was pretty well below the range of what we’ve seen from him in the past—i…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *FOLKS! We’ve got a start date for this year’s Development Camp and it is less than two weeks away!!! Professional hockey players in Flyers jerseys on the ice in twelve days. Oh baby. [Flyers]
*In other news that we got yesterday, the Flyers will continue their partnership with the Reading Royals for a few more years. [Royals]
*Brian Elliott was a good dude, a good backup, and a fine Flyer during his tenure. We’ve nothing but good things to say as we send him off to Tampa Bay. [BSH]
*It may be mid-August but we’ve still got some pretty good free agents kicking around and, as such, some rumors kicking around them. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, Cam Atkinson is really laying it on thick and really trying to ingratiate himself with the Flyers’ fanbase. AND IT IS WORKING. [BSH]</span>

The Imperium still stands, and man are they pissed
 Eve Online’s latest player-led war has come to an end, not with a bang but with a cavernous whimper. Those on the offense have turned tail, and the defenders are putting everything they have into running them down.
The massive coalition known as PAPI campaigned for 55 weeks in a quest to destroy The Imperium, led by Alex “The Mittani” Gianturco, before losing the will to fight. Along the way, Eve Online developer CCP Games told Polygon, combatants destroyed more than $3 million worth of in-game ships and virtual infrastructure in the conflict dubbed World War Bee 2.
“This is as real as real talk gets,” said Brave Collective’s Dunk Dinkle in a live address to his fleets, in what amounted to PAPI’s conces…</span>

A bug that caused a bug
 “Hey, you’re finally awake ...” and now being catapulted to the moon thanks to a very strong bee.
Former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday describing a notorious bug — an actual bug, at least in-game — that caused major problems during The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim’s development. Purkeypile described the introductory scene in Skyrim where the player wakes up in the back of a cart with other prisoners. It’s where the famous “You’re finally wake” meme originated — but it’s also remembered by the developer for a catastrophic collision. 
So, I have a story about the Skyrim Intro and how hard game development is.
That intro is famous now, but back then, it was just that one thing …</span>

A meticulously paced disciple of Metroid
 Axiom Verge 2 is a Metroidvania game for people who hate the term “Metroidvania.” Thomas Happ Games’ second outing has a purist’s view of the genre built by Metroid that feels like a refreshing change of pace in a sea of imitators. More importantly, while its meticulously paced exploration and upgrade loops are a little too close to its inspiration at times, it’s the way Axiom Verge 2 digs into the isolation at the heart of the Metroid series that makes it stand out.
Axiom Verge 2 strands you on the cold, mysterious world of Kiengir and cuts right to the chase. You don’t know what’s going on or what anyone else is doing here, but you’re bent on going back to Earth. So you …</span>

No release date was given, but it is expected to arrive soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is on the way. On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.
In addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.
Senior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”


Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year. It has yet to release for current generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, where it is only playable in compatibility mode.


Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June. You can read the full 1.3 patch notes at the game’s official website.</span>

Eat your heart out, Garo Yepremian
 Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, Rick Felice’s empty-the-garage mashup of sporting goods and athletes, at last launches on Xbox One on Aug. 27. This version, teased as far back as GDC 2017, brings along a new Season Mode that supports local cooperative play with up to three players.
“Now you and your friends can create a team, build a fan base, win trophies, and discover secrets, multiple endings, and 100 achievements along the way,” Felice said. An update for the Windows PC version is coming soon; it will support cloud saves, remote play, and the 100 new achievements, too.

This is Epic Games’ second crack at a hidden role mode
 Fortnite has another new Among Us-style mode and this time its a lot closer to its inspiration. Epic revealed the new mode on Tuesday, as part of Fortnite’s latest patch.
The new limited time mode is called Impostors, and it features 10 players — eight Agents and two Impostors — in each match. All 10 players are aboard The Bridge on the island (also like Among Us). The Agents are trying to complete tasks that will help them arrive at their destination safely; Impostors try to eliminate the Agents without having their identity discovered. Whenever things seem a little too suspicious, or when player’s body is found, all the remaining players convene to discuss who the Impostor might be.

                    <span>Over at In Focus, Alan Taylor is highlighting the work of Bob Wick, a photographer for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management who recently retired after 33 years of service.
In a recent interview, Bob reflected on his career. “It has been extremely fulfilling to see my photos used in BLM, across the Department, and non-profits and getting to showcase the beauty of public lands and the resources we see,” he said. “When you see things on paper in words, it’s one thing, but when you see the image of the lands that you’re affecting with that resource decision, it’s a more powerful way to communicate the message.” 
Bob added, “I like bringing joy to people with photos. A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”

                    <span>For a Volkswagen ad campaign in 1988, Kurt Vonnegut wrote a letter of advice to people living in 2088. In the video above from 2019, Benedict Cumberbatch reads Vonnegut’s prescient letter. His main message is an environmental one: that if we don’t get our shit together, Nature will have its way with us.
The sort of leaders we need now are not those who promise ultimate victory over Nature through perseverance in living as we do right now, but those with the courage and intelligence to present to the world what appears to be Nature’s stern but reasonable surrender terms:
1. Reduce and stabilize your population.

                    <span>Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario has covered Afghanistan for the past 20 years. In the Atlantic, she writes about the effect of the return to power of the oppressive Islamic-fundamentalist Taliban will have on the country’s citizens, particularly women and girls. Here she describes life under the Taliban in 2000 and 2001:
Perhaps the silence of life under the Taliban sits with me more than anything. There were very few cars, no music, no television, no telephones, and no idle conversation on the sidewalks. The dusty streets were crowded with widows who had lost their husbands in the protracted war; banned from working, their only means of survival was to beg. People were scared, indoors and out. Those who were brave enough to venture out spoke in hushed voices, for fea…</span>

                    <span>In The Hidden Melodies of Subways Around the World, the NY Times takes a look at an often overlooked aspect of transit design: the door closing sounds on the subway. My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: 
In Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”
In Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)


You can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.

                    <span>Apple today told retail staff in the United States and Europe that it is planning to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes starting on August 30, reports Bloomberg.





Classes are set to resume at most U.S. locations, but Apple&#x27;s plan to roll out in-person classes could be delayed at some Apple Store locations in areas where there is a surge in COVID-19 cases. 



With Today at Apple sessions slated to return, Apple today began accepting signups for in-store sessions on its website. Apple has not held in-person classes at its retail stores since March 2020, but the company has been offering virtual classes and the occasional outdoor class.





Apple retail stores have been reopened since earlier this year, but Apple recently reinstated a mask mandate that requires customers visiting most retail stores in the United States to wear a mask. Apple had dropped mask mandates for vaccinated customers in June, but brought them back in areas heavily impacted by the Delta variant of COVID-19.

                    <span>T-Mobile today confirmed that some of its data had been accessed without authorization in a breach that may impact more than 100 million of its users.





Over the weekend, T-Mobile began investigating a forum post that offered data from more than 100 million people. T-Mobile was not mentioned in that post, but the person selling the data told Motherboard that it had come from T-Mobile&#x27;s servers, thus leading T-Mobile to look into it. The hacker who spoke to Motherboard claimed that several T-Mobile servers had been breached.



T-Mobile has now confirmed that there was indeed unauthorized access to some customer data, but T-Mobile in a statement says it does not yet know if personal customer data has been accessed.

                    <span>Apple today released a new version of its iCloud for Windows app, with the 12.5 update adding a new ‌iCloud‌ Keychain password manager app for Windows users.





With the new password management option, those who are running Windows can access their ‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords and can add, edit, copy and paste, delete, and look up usernames or passwords. Apple in January released an updated version of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows that hinted at the new password app, but Apple did not implement it until now.



New ‌iCloud‌ password extensions for Microsoft Edge and Windows Chrome work in tandem with the password feature, letting ‌iCloud‌ passwords be autofilled on a Windows machine just like in Safari. Usernames and passwords created for websites are automatically added to the Passwords app.





‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords on Windows are stored in an encrypted database and are transferred to the browser extension using an encrypted channel, with passwords not stored in clear text.



‌iCloud‌ for Windows Passwords is part of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows 12.5, and Windows users can download it from the Microsoft Store. The ‌iCloud‌ for Windows app is designed to let Windows users access their ‌iCloud‌ files, photos, emails, and more from Windows devices.

Thanks to a new screen sharing feature called SharePlay, you can share your screen with other people on a call, which is great for choosing a movie, browsing through a photo album, or anything else that&#x27;s enhanced by group discussion. Here&#x27;s how the new screen sharing feature works.


Launch FaceTime on your iPhone or iPad.


Tap New FaceTime and add the contacts that you want to share your screen with, then tap the FaceTime button. Alternately, select a recent contact to initiate a video call.



When the call has connected, tap the SharePlay button at the top-right corner of the screen in the new control panel.

                    <span>The popular VPN service NordVPN has rolled out an update to add native support for Apple silicon Macs.





As of version 6.6.1, NordVPN natively supports Apple silicon Macs, such as the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and 24-inch iMac, which each sport the M1 chip.



Although the update started to roll out on August 3, a blog post by Nord has today announced that the 6.6.1 update is now fully available via the App Store and the NordVPN website, where the app is available for download.



While the VPN app previously ran on Apple silicon Macs via Rosetta 2, which translates apps made for Intel Macs so that they work on Macs with the ‌M1‌ chip, the new native version of the app is able to run more efficiently without the need for Rosetta 2. The new version of the app is universal, meaning that it can run on both Intel and Apple silicon architectures.



The update comes ahead of the widely-anticipated launch of new Apple silicon Macs, such as 14 and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pro models. NordVPN version 6.6.1 is now available via the ‌App Store‌ and the NordVPN website.

                    <span>Apple must pay $300 million in damages to Optis Wireless Technology for infringing a handful of patents related to 4G LTE technology, a Texas jury has ruled (via Reuters).





In August 2020, a jury found that Apple had infringed five Optis wireless patents and awarded $506 million in damages, but a Texas judge vacated that award in April and ordered a new trial to focus on damages only.



US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury was unable to determine if the amount was awarded on the FRAND terms (a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis) usually required in standard essential patent cases.



PanOptis and its sister companies, Optis Wireless Technology, Optis Cellular Technology, Unwired Planet, and Unwired Planet International, are non-practicing entities that hold patents and generate revenue through patent litigation, otherwise known as patent trolls.



In a statement, Apple said: &quot;Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate. We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.&quot;

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s use of mini-LED panels in its forthcoming MacBook lineups will catalyze supplier investment and push the entire industry toward adoption of the display technology, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.





Like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple&#x27;s upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are expected to feature mini-LED displays. In his latest investor note, seen by MacRumors, Kuo says this will stoke strategic supplier investment in the technology, which will allow Apple to diversify supply risk and bring down production costs.

We believe that MacBooks, not iPads, mainly drive Mini LED panel shipments. MacBook shipments have not grown much in the past few years. However, we expect MacBook shipments to grow significantly by 20% YoY, or more in 2021 and 2022, due to th…</span>

It’s impossible not to like our new #89.
 The summer of 2021, across nearly all sports worldwide, has brought about massive amounts of change for both athletes and teams. Some clubs have come back with completely different rosters, while others (such as Cleveland’s baseball team) with an entirely different name. This theme of change was really cemented when arguably the most popular athlete in the world, Lionel Messi, swapped Barcelona, a city he’s called home for over twenty years, for Paris in a move that shocked most of the world. 
But that’s enough about other sports, this is a hockey blog!
Perhaps no other team in the NHL has done more to overhaul themselves than the Philadelphia Flyers. After what was decidedly an unac…</span>

The veteran goalie was, again, pressed into more action than him or the Flyers would have liked — and the results backed it up.
 Just about nothing went right for the Flyers in terms of goaltending in 2020-21, but Brian Elliott provided dependable veteran presence despite albeit less-than-stellar results. 
And in a massive — and unexpected — surprise, Elliott ended up logging the most games and starts of any Flyers goalie last season. The 36-year-old was pressed into more duty than expected as Carter Hart struggled mightily in his third season of NHL action. 
Hart’s numbers weren’t pretty, and playing behind a Flyers defense that couldn’t keep it together for large stretches of the season didn’t help either. Those results took a toll on …</span>

 League of Legends developer Riot Games has been accused by California regulators that the game maker hasn’t properly told its workers’ of their rights to participate in an ongoing investigation and lawsuit against the company. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which also filed suit against Activision Blizzard in July, released a statement Monday (PDF) that said Riot has delayed informing its employees of their rights for two months.
Riot was ordered to send a notice to its employees on June 4 — to issue a memo that “advise[d] workers of their right to speak freely with the government about unlawful workplace practices” without fear of retaliation, regardless o…</span>

Horror game’s next chapter may summon Pinhead
 Horror game Dead by Daylight’s next chapter will apparently bring the Hellraiser film franchise into the fold, based on a series of teases from developer Behaviour Interactive. That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.
Behaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.
That’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.
Behaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.
Dead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.</span>

Check out the War for Wakanda War Table to see T’Challa in action
 Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix dropped a detailed video about Marvel’s Avengers’ War for Wakanda expansion during a livestream on Monday. The new War Table presentation gives players a look at what Black Panther can do in Marvel’s Avengers. 
T’Challa will finally become a playable character in Marvel’s Avengers on Aug. 17, bringing the roster of playable heroes to nine. Black Panther is a melee-based character and can double jump to help him traverse the environment quickly. Unlike Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — who shared some baseline gameplay similarities — Black Panther is a completely unique hero.

Sledgehammer Games’ new Call of Duty is almost here
 Activision released a new teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard, officially announcing the next game in the series after a series of leaks. Players will get a first look at this year’s Call of Duty game on Aug. 19, during a special event inside Call of Duty: Warzone called the Battle of Verdansk.
The first trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard opens with a montage of battlefields that centers on World War II. There’s a sniper’s nest that appears to be in or near Russia, a desert battlefield, a German forest, and a beach littered with destroyed aircraft. Each one of these areas features a face somewhere in the landscape, and sometimes a name (Petrova in Cyrillic, Sgt. Kingsley), hinting at characters that will …</span>

Kratos’ voice actor on how legacy factors into his T’Challa performance
 “My mom’s always right,” Christopher Judge told me in an interview ahead of his starring role as King T’Challa, the Black Panther, in Marvel’s Avengers’ upcoming War for Wakanda expansion.
Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix announced that Judge — known as the voice of Kratos in 2018’s God of War and as Teal’c in Stargate SG-1 — would play Black Panther in an Entertainment Weekly interview in mid-July. In the article, Judge revealed that he initially turned down the opportunity to voice T’Challa, believing that nobody could do the role justice after Chadwick Boseman. But his mother, as well as his children, convinced him otherwise. On the other side of the experience, Judge t…</span>

Patch 1.3 is expected soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is expected to launch soon. On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.
First, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. 


Second, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.


Finally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.
“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”
Monday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way. CD Projekt promises more details on Aug. 17 during a live Twitch stream.
Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.</span>

Diana Prince will join Batman and Superman in the battle royale 
 Fortnite is getting a little more heroic with the addition of a Wonder Woman outfit in an upcoming update. 
Diana Prince’s outfit will come with a battle armor variant as well as her iconic regular costume. Of course, the outfit won’t be the only cosmetic for the Amazonian hero. She’ll also be released alongside the Athena’s Battleaxe gathering tool, the DC Trinity loading screen, where she poses with Batman and Superman, the Golden Eagle Wings glider, and the Diana’s Mantle back bling. 
The new skin will make Diana Prince the latest member of the Justice League to join Fortnite. Many other heroes have found a place on the Fortnite island in the last several years, including several others from DC, like Beast Boy and Raven, as well as Marvel heroes like Black Widow, and the rest of the Avengers. 
Fortnite’s Wonder Woman skin will be released on Aug. 19. To celebrate the release of the new outfit, Epic will also host the Wonder Woman Cup tournament and give players a few challenges to complete, all related to the Amazonian warrior.</span>

Arc System Works’ second DLC fighter is almost here
 Jack-O’ Valentine is coming to Guilty Gear Strive at the end of August, developer Arc System Works announced Sunday. Jack-O’ will be the second playable fighter included as part of the fighting game’s first season pass, following alien-coffin-wielding military man Goldlewis Dickinson’s release in July.
Guilty Gear fans are already quite familiar with Jack-O’. She was added as a playable character in 2016’s Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator, and in Strive, she’ll fight using her jack-o’-lantern-themed ball and chain, and a trio of summonable minions. You can see her in action in the trailer above.


Jack-O’ is coming to Guilty Gear Strive on Aug. 27 for players who own the game’s $29.99 season pass. Everyone else can download her starting Aug. 30, for $6.99. She’s one of five characters planned for Guilty Gear Strive’s first season pass. One more DLC fighter is planned for release in 2021, with two more coming in 2022.
Guilty Gear fans can also look forward to Baiken from Arc System Works’ fighting game series coming to SNK’s Samurai Shodown as part of season pass 3.


Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.</span>

                    <span>Apple is planning to hold multiple events this fall, which will collectively include the launch of new iPhones, Apple Watches, updated AirPods, revamped iPad mini, and the redesigned MacBook Pros, according to respected Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman. 





In his latest weekly Power On newsletter, Gurman says that much like last year, Apple will hold multiple events this coming fall, with the first likely being in September for the iPhone 13. Last year, due to the global health crisis and production constraints, the iPhone 12 lineup was not announced until October. The 2020 September event, rather than focusing on new iPhones, showcased new Apple Watches, iPads, and services.

                    <span>HBO Max will release a completely rebuilt Apple TV app by the end of the year to overcome a variety of issues users have experienced with the current version, according to a new report.





Shortly after Warnermedia removed its HBO Max offering from ‌Apple TV‌ Channels in May, an update to its subsequently released tvOS app essentially broke several features of the service.



In June, HBO Max dropped the native tvOS video player in favor of a custom video player, which introduced issues with fast-forwarding and rewinding video in the app.



Recognizing its mistake, HBO quickly reinstated the native tvOS video player UI. However, problems with playback control remained, while users have continued to report other issues to do with subtitles and audio description.

When attempting to use a scanner with a Mac, Apple said users might get an error message indicating they do not have permission to open the application, followed by the name of the scanner driver. The message says to contact a computer or network administrator for assistance, or indicates that the Mac failed to open a connection to the device.

School-based teachers and staff, central office, regular vendors and network employees who aren’t fully vaccinated or can’t provide documentation of an exemption by the deadline will be ineligible to work for the district until they submit proof of inoculation or exemption.
Until the Oct. 15 cutoff, staff who aren’t vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test at least once a week, the district said. As of August, 68 percent of district employees have been fully vaccinated, according to self-reported district data. Among teachers, that rate is higher, with 82 percent reporting that they are fully vaccinated.
More like this, please.

A bit of housekeeping is complete. 
 We’re deep into August and things are pretty quiet on the hockey news front, at least for the Flyers, but they still have a few loose ends that needed (or might need) tying up, and they knocked out one of those today. 
The Flyers announced this afternoon that they’ve signed their 2021 second round pick Samu Tuomaala to a three-year entry level contract. Tuomaala spent the 2020-21 season with Kärpät’s U20 team, where he put up 31 points (15 goals and 16 assists) in 30 regular season games, and four points (1G, 4A) in five playoff games. He also represented Finland in the U18 World Championship, and he recorded 11 points (5G, 6A) in seven games, leading his team in scoring. 
In short: he’s good, gang! Here’s what Flyers’ AGM Brent Flahr and Director of European Scouting Joakim Grundberg had to say about him. 
“He’s a guy we targeted. We kind of thought he would probably go at the end of the first or somewhere in the 20s and he fell. A real talented winger. Great skater. Real dynamic speed. Loves to shoot the puck. Talented kid. He’s going to take a little time to get stronger and put on a little weight. A talented kid that has real good offensive upside.” - Flahr
“Obviously very excited getting him. He was rated as a first round talent. We were able to get him in the middle of the second round, so we’re really excited about that. To us, he has elite speed and high skill. Very good shot. High-offensive upside. There’s things he’s got to work on like his overall game and obviously getting stronger. We’re really excited. We see a lot of upside there.” - Grundberg
Now, it may still be a little while before we see Tuomaala make the jump over to North America. He’s slated to join Kärpät (Liiga) next season, and this ELC can slide to allow that to happen. But he’s locked in with the Flyers all the same, and it’s a bit of housekeeping taken care of.</span>

                    <span>For The Atlantic, Katherine Wu writes about the difficulty of communicating how vaccines work and how they protect individuals and communities from disease: Vaccines Are Like Sunscreen… No, Wait, Airbags… No, Wait…
Unfortunately, communal benefit is harder to define, harder to quantify, and harder to describe than individual protection, because “it’s not the way Americans are used to thinking about things,” Neil Lewis, a behavioral scientist and communications expert at Cornell, told me. That’s in part because communal risk isn’t characteristic of the health perils people in wealthy countries are accustomed to facing: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer. Maybe that’s part of why we gravitate toward individual-focused comparisons. Slipping into a pandemic-compatible, population-based frame of mind is a big shift. In the age of COVID-19, “there’s been a lot of focus on the individual,” Lewis told me. That’s pretty at odds “with how infection works.”


As someone who has struggled with analogizing the virus &amp; vaccines, I was nodding my head a lot while reading this. Something I’ve noticed in recent years that Wu didn’t get into is that readers desire precision in metaphors and analogies, even though metaphor is — by definition! — not supposed to be taken literally. People seem much more interested in taking analogies apart, identifying what doesn’t work, and discarding them rather than — more generously and constructively IMO — using them as the author intended to better understand the subject matter. The perfect metaphor doesn’t exist because then it wouldn’t be a metaphor.

                    <span>In an issue of his newsletter, The Convivial Society, L.M. Sacasas posed 41 questions that we should ask ourselves about technologies to help us “draw out the moral or ethical implications of our tools”. Here are a few of the questions:
3. How will the use of this technology affect my experience of time?


Sacasas recently joined Ezra Klein on his podcast to talk through some of the answers to these questions for certain technologies.
EZRA KLEIN: I’m gonna group the next set together. So what was required of other human beings, of other creatures, of the earth, so that I might be able to use this technology? When you ask that, when you think of that, what comes to mind?
MICHAEL SACASAS: So I recently wrote a piece, and its premise was that sometimes we think of the internet, of digital life, as being immaterial, existing somewhere out in the ether, in the cloud, with these metaphors that kind of suggest that it doesn’t really have a material footprint. But the reality of course — I think as most of us are becoming very aware — is that it very much has a material reality that may begin in a mine where rare earth metals are being extracted in inhumane working conditions at great cost to the local environment.
But that’s very far removed from my comfortable experience of the tablet on my couch in the living room. And so with regards to the earth, the digital realm depends upon material resources that need to be collected. It depends on the energy grid. It leaves a footprint on the environment.
And so we tend not to think about that by the time that it gets to us and looks so shiny and clean and new, and connects us to this world that isn’t physically necessarily located anywhere in our experience. And so I think it is important for us to think about the labor, the extraction cost on the environment, that go into providing us with the kind of world that we find so amusing and interesting and comfortable.

                    <span>One of the many effects of human-driven climate change is that, on average, the bodies of animals are getting smaller — birds, fish, deer, frogs, rodents, insects. And these changes could have large and unpredictable consequences.
“That’s the problem with human-driven climate change. It’s the rate of change that’s just orders of magnitude faster than what the natural world has had to deal with in the past. Size is really important to survival, and you can’t just change that indefinitely without consequence. For one thing, I don’t think it’s feasible that species are going to be able to continue to get smaller and maintain things like a migration from one hemisphere to another.”
And since smaller bodies can hold fewer eggs, they result in fewer offspring, and a lower population size in the long run. For amphibians who need to keep their skin wet in order to breathe, shrinking can mean higher chances of drying out in a drought because their bodies absorb and hold smaller quantities of water.
But the more concerning consequences have to do with how this could destabilize relationships between species. Because shrinking plays out at different rates for different species, predators might have to eat more and more of shrinking prey, for example, throwing a finely-tuned ecosystem off balance.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 is taking another step toward replacing the traditional wallet, adding several new features to its digital Wallet app that will allow people to leave their physical cards and keys behind.





This guide highlights all of the new features that are coming to the Wallet app in ‌iOS 15‌, but it&#x27;s worth noting that many of them rely on third-party companies and services adopting Wallet support.



Digital IDs


In the United States, Apple is working with state authorities to allow iPhone users to add their driver&#x27;s license or state ID card to the Wallet app, which would allow digital IDs to be used in lieu of a physical ID card.





Apple is also working with the TSA to allow digital ID cards to be used at TSA checkpoints, with the digital ID able to be shown…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple Arcade recently surpassed 200 games available on the service, and several new titles are coming soon, including Tetris Beat, Baldo, Asphalt 8: Airborne, Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey, Zen Pinball Party, Zookeeper World, MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook, and more.





Another game can be added to the list, as Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls from well-known Japanese company Konami is set to launch exclusively on Apple Arcade, across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Mobile gaming enthusiasts may remember that the game had soft launched on the App Store in Canada back in 2019, but it was removed less than a year later. No specific release date has been announced for its Apple Arcade return.



The side-scrolling action game will feature a lineup of iconic characters from the popular gothic video game series, including Alucard, Simon Belmont, Charlotte, Shanoa, Maria, and more to come. Players will be tasked with blasting their way through Dracula&#x27;s army using a variety of attacks, weapons, and unique character moves.



The original trailer for the game from 2019 can be watched below.






In addition, a trio of Apple Arcade games have recently been updated, with a new mini-game and new quests added to The Oregon Trail, five new songs added to Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat, and 200 new levels added in Simon&#x27;s Cat - Story Time.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically. A free one-month trial is available for first-time subscribers.

                    <span>The Connectivity Standards Alliance, which includes Apple, Google, and Amazon, has announced it will delay the launch of its &quot;Matter&quot; standard, which aims to unify the smart home ecosystem of the largest tech giants, according to a blog post by the Alliance posted today (via Stacey on IoT).





&quot;Matter,&quot; announced last year and formerly known as &quot;Project CHIP,&quot; is a unified IP-based connectivity that aims to make a standard universal protocol for developers to build Internet of Things devices. The Alliance had previously sought to roll out the standard in the latter portion of this year, but it&#x27;s now been delayed until 2022. 



The group says that &quot;Matter&quot; is complete in regards to its feature set. However, according to the blog post, it still needs to continue working on the program in which developers can apply for certification and finish the SDK for developers to use.



Several smart home accessory makers have signed onto using Matter as a standard protocol, including Amazon, ASSA ABLOY, Comcast, Espressif Systems, Eve Systems, Google, Grundfos Holding A/S, Huawei, Infineon Technologies, LEEDARSON, Legrand, Nanoleaf, and others.

                    <span>LG&#x27;s first-ever OLED monitor has officially come to market, with the company&#x27;s new 32-inch UltraFine Display OLED Pro Monitor now available to order through B&amp;H Photo Video. Pricing is set at $3,999 in the United States.





Designed for creative professionals, LG says the monitor&#x27;s 4K OLED panel provides exceptional color accuracy. However, the technology comes at a steep price compared to LG&#x27;s standard UltraFine 4K monitor with LCD technology, which is available for $699.95 through Apple&#x27;s online store in the United States.



Key tech specs of the monitor include HDR10, 99% coverage of the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a 60Hz refresh rate, 250 nits peak brightness, pixel dimming technology, a 1ms response time, and a 178º viewing angle. The monitor can be connected to a compatible Mac with a single USB-C cable, with 90W pass-through charging for any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.






Other connectivity on the rear of the monitor includes one HDMI port, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, three USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.



The monitor is currently out of stock on LG&#x27;s website, but can be ordered from B&amp;H Photo Video.

                    <span>Eve Spectrum bills itself as the first crowd-developed monitor, and it was in the works for quite some time ahead of launch. The Eve Spectrum is now shipping out and available, so we thought we&#x27;d test it out to see if it&#x27;s worth picking up.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


There are three versions of the 27-inch Spectrum display. For $459, you can get a Spectrum QHD with a 144Hz refresh rate, while a 240Hz version is available for $609. A 4K version is also available with a 144Hz refresh rate, and this top-of-the-line version costs $799. The Spectrum stand for those who aren&#x27;t using a VESA mount is an additional $99.



MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera has been testing the 4K 144Hz version, and he found the design to be minimal, clean, and subtle, and for video editing work, it performed well.



Colors were accurate and natural and viewing angles were solid, but there is some light bleed with blacks and contrast doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to some other displays at this price point.



Gameplay was smooth thanks to the high refresh rate, and the high contrast and peak brightness made games look great. There were times, however, that the video feed would die, and it&#x27;s unclear if the issue was a cable or a port.



The Eve Spectrum comes equipped with a single DisplayPort port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, along with an audio port. There&#x27;s no Thunderbolt support, but with a 100W USB-C port, it can charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro.



There are few gaming monitors with these specs and HDMI 2.1, so for those who need these features, the Spectrum may be worth checking out. Make sure to watch the full video up above to see it in action.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, has today defended the company&#x27;s controversial planned child safety features in a significant interview with The Wall Street Journal, revealing a number of new details about the safeguards built into Apple&#x27;s system for scanning users&#x27; photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).





Federighi admitted that Apple had handled last week&#x27;s announcement of the two new features poorly, relating to detecting explicit content in Messages for children and CSAM content stored in iCloud Photos libraries, and acknowledged the widespread confusion around the tools:
It&#x27;s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood. We wish that this would&#x27;ve come out a little more…</span>

                    <span>Apple may be forced to remove the Lightning port from the iPhone in favor of USB-C, according to legislation expected be presented by the European Commission next month, Reuters reports.





The legislation would establish a common charging port for all mobile phones and other relevant devices in all European Union countries. The move is expected to primarily affect Apple, since many popular Android devices already feature USB-C ports.



In 2018, the European Commission tried to reach a final resolution on the issue but it failed to come into law. At the time, Apple warned that forcing a common charging port on the industry would stifle innovation and create electronic waste as consumers were forced to switch to new cables.





	
The EU Wants All Phones to Work With Interoperable Chargers, Here’s What That Means for Apple&#x27;s Lightning Port






A European Commission impact assessment study conducted in 2019 found that half of all charging cables sold with mobile phones had a USB micro-B connector, 29 percent had a USB-C connector, and 21 percent had a Lightning connector. The study suggested five options for a common charger, with various options that cover ports on devices and ports on power adapters.



Last year, the debate was reignited as the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of a common charger, citing less environmental waste and user convenience as the main benefits.



The executive branch of the European Union is currently drafting the legislation, according to sources speaking to Reuters, which is expected to be presented next month.

                    <span>Apple employees are now joining the choir of individuals raising concerns over Apple&#x27;s plans to scan iPhone users&#x27; photo libraries for CSAM or child sexual abuse material, reportedly speaking out internally about how the technology could be used to scan users&#x27; photos for other types of content, according to a report from Reuters.





According to Reuters, an unspecified number of Apple employees have taken to internal Slack channels to raise concerns over CSAM detection. Specifically, employees are concerned that governments could force Apple to use the technology for censorship by finding content other than CSAM. Some employees are worried that Apple is damaging its industry-leading privacy reputation.

                    <span>More on the thinking behind Glass:
Om: Tom, tell us a bit about yourself and what prompted you to
start Glass.
Tom Watson: I’ve been designing digital products for over 20
years now. I was an early Product Designer at Facebook (2009-2013)
and Pinterest (2013-2018). I saw the tradeoffs firsthand around
having to design for engagement versus people using the product.
That experience made me want to build something different. […]
We intentionally didn’t raise venture capital. We didn’t want to
make the compromises that I saw earlier in my career. With no
outside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo
advertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several
other things we feel would compromise the product and community
we’re trying to build.
Om: Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional
photographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?
TW: It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be
anything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone
with tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe
great photography can come from anywhere and anyone. We hope to
build a community for all levels of photographers to learn, grow,
and generally nerd out about photography.

                    <span>Glass is a new photo sharing app/community:
We want you to adore Glass, not become addicted to it. We’ve
created a distraction-free app focused on one thing — your
photos. […] All the social network features you’d expect with
none of the dark patterns driving engagement. Build relationships
with and learn from other photographers while enjoying a
chronological feed and no public counts. […]
Glass is subscription-based, which means we won’t sell your data
or pollute your feed with ads. We don’t answer to outside
investors or advertisers, just members of our community.
$4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly $29.99 yearly (at launch)
keeps Glass rolling.
Is it just like OG Instagram? No. Glass is doing its own thing in a bunch of subtle ways. But it’s certainly a lot more like Instagram circa 2010 than Instagram is today. In spirit, it feels a lot like the early days of Flickr. I’ve been beta testing Glass for a few months and it’s an absolutely lovely, exquisitely-designed app. It’s downright serene scrolling through my Glass timeline, something that I haven’t been able to say about Instagram in many years.
Currently iOS only — in fact, I believe the only way to sign in is through Sign In With Apple. There’s a wait list to get in now that they’re out of beta; if Glass intrigues you, I encourage you to sign up now.

                    <span>Clarifying interview, with at least one bit of news: Federighi says the heretofore unspecified “threshold” for CSAM fingerprint matches that must be reached before an iCloud account is flagged (or even can be flagged, thanks to how the shared-key cryptography is implemented) is “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images”. Right around the 3:00 mark:
“And if, and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order
of 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does
Apple know anything about your account and know anything about
those images.”
There’s also a WSJ news story (News+ link), co-bylined by Stern and Tim Higgins, in which Federighi emphasizes that the database of CSAM fingerprints is auditable:
Beyond creating a system that isn’t scanning through all of a
user’s photos in the cloud, Mr. Federighi pointed to another
benefit of placing the matching process on the phone directly.
“Because it’s on the [phone], security researchers are constantly
able to introspect what’s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,”
he said. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the
scope of this in some way — in a way that we had committed to not
doing — there’s verifiability, they can spot that that’s
happening.”
Critics have said the database of images could be corrupted, such
as political material being inserted. Apple has pushed back
against that idea. During the interview, Mr. Federighi said the
database of images is constructed through the intersection of
images from multiple child-safety organizations — not just the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He added that
at least two “are in distinct jurisdictions.” Such groups and an
independent auditor will be able to verify that the database
consists only of images provided by those entities, he said.

The young prospect that made a huge impact last season is staying off the ice for a while.
 This is going to be a significant year for Philadelphia Flyers prospects, but one of them is going to be sitting on the sidelines for potentially quite a while.
Announced by the team on Friday, 2020 fourth-round pick Zayde Wisdom has undergone successful shoulder surgery this summer and is out indefinitely.
Injury update: 2020 NHL Draft pick (4th round, 94th overall) Zayde Wisdom had successful shoulder surgery today in Philadelphia. Wisdom appeared in 28 games last season with the @LVPhantoms (AHL), recording 18 points (7g-11a). He is out indefinitely. pic.twitter.com/rkXfsnxCv1

The former second overall selection has had his fair share of troubles in Philadelphia, but it was never really a fit, especially last season.
 Nolan Patrick’s entire existence as a member of the Philadelphia Flyers has been a weird one. With overcorrection and hope that he would be worthy of his second overall status, or just plain hatred towards him for suffering through multiple injuries and not being the answer for an aging core of forwards—even at just 22 years old he was seen as washed up.
Well, now we don’t really have to worry about him anymore, as he was eventually shipped off to the Vegas Golden Knights after being a part of the package for top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis. Who knew that his draft pedigree could carry him that …</span>

The developers sneaked in a reference to the game 
 A new victory scene from Call of Duty: Warzone’s recently launched season hints at 2021’s Call of Duty game, according to footage posted online on Friday. This year’s entry in the franchise, which is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games, will be called Call of Duty: Vanguard and send players back to World War II, according to images of the game that leaked earlier this week.
The victory scene is new for season 5 of Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which went live on Friday. The cutscene shows the winning team being extracted from the battlefield — that is until, a red-haired woman in a Soviet World War II uniform shoots the last player with an old-school wooden sniper rifle. The soldier’s attire and weapon seem to support the aforementioned leaks, which suggested that 2021’s Call of Duty game will take place in WWII. 
What’s more is that the character herself resembles a person depicted in leaked images of Vanguard — further seeming to confirm prior information, and that the victory scene is a reference to the upcoming game. 
The leaks also contained details on Vanguard’s Ultimate Edition and information about three bundles for the game. However, they didn’t mention a release date for Vanguard. 
Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer.</span>

Get four weapons in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Endless Vale
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — Igneous Hammer, Solar hand cannon
7 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
Flawless — Shayura’s Wrath (Adept), Void submachine gun
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

                    <span>EP releases are a funny thing. There used to be a time when they weren’t really a big deal so-to-speak. Sure, occasionally a band would release something of some serious musical value i.e. Haunting the Chapel, Morbid Tales, Sentence of Death, In the Sign of Evil, Despise the Sun, as well as others, but for […]</span>

                    <span>There’s no ignoring Alchemy of Flesh’s Floridian death metal sound, so let’s get that out of the way from the outset. The force, groove, tempo changes, and, ultimately, heft of Morbid Angel is all over this debut.

                    <span>Usually when I post these sorts of non-narrative videos — in this case, a series of creative stop motion vignettes featuring matchsticks made by Tomohiro Okazaki — I say something to the effect of “I could have watched this all day” or “I wish this video were longer” because they’re often quite short. Well, this one is seven and a half minutes long and I still wish it had gone on for longer. Ok sure, you get the point after awhile, but each successive animation is just as inventive than the last that it kept me hooked.

                    <span>This is an extraordinary story by Jennifer Senior about the various ways in which members of a family grieved the death of a beloved son who died in NYC on 9/11: What Bobby McIlvaine Left Behind.
Early on, the McIlvaines spoke to a therapist who warned them that each member of their family would grieve differently. Imagine that you’re all at the top of a mountain, she told them, but you all have broken bones, so you can’t help each other. You each have to find your own way down.
It was a helpful metaphor, one that may have saved the McIlvaines’ marriage. But when I mentioned it to Roxane Cohen Silver, a psychology professor at UC Irvine who’s spent a lifetime studying the effects of sudden, traumatic loss, she immediately spotted a problem with it: “That suggests everyone will make it down…</span>

                    <span>I’m just going to go ahead and say it right up front here: if you had certain expectations in May/June about how the pandemic was going to end in the US (or was even thinking it was over), you need to throw much of that mindset in the trash and start again because the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has changed the game. I know this sucks to hear,1 but Delta is sufficiently different that we need to reset and stop assuming we can solely rely on the vaccines to stop Covid-19 from spreading. Ed Yong’s typically excellent piece on how delta has changed the pandemic’s endgame is helping me wrap my head around this.
But something is different now — the virus. “The models in late spring were pretty consistent that we were going to have a ‘normal’ summer,” Samuel Scarpino of the Rockefeller Foundatio…</span>

                    <span>The Panola Project is a short film by Rachael DeCruz and Jeremy Levine that follows the efforts of local convenience store owner Dorothy Oliver to get the people in her small Alabama community vaccinated against Covid-19. A trusted member of her community, Oliver teams up with county commissioner Drucilla Russ-Jackson to call &amp; go door-to-door, talking with people one-on-one, cajoling and telling personal stories of loss to get folks signed up for a mobile vaccination clinic.
In the film, Oliver and Russ-Jackson arrange for a hospital to set up a pop-up site in Panola, but the site will only be established if they get at least forty people to sign up to take the vaccine. We follow Oliver as she goes door to door, talking people into signing up, lightly cajoling them about their fears and c…</span>

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 is making several improvements to Spotlight, aka the universal search feature that can be accessed on the iPhone or iPad&#x27;s Home Screen with a downward swipe.





Spotlight is a one-stop resource for accessing everything you might want to find on an iOS device, and in ‌iOS 15‌, it&#x27;s better than ever. This guide highlights all of the new features that are coming to Spotlight with Apple&#x27;s latest update.



Rich Search Results


Apple&#x27;s Siri knowledge database has been expanded and the Spotlight feature now supports rich search results, so you can get more information than before directly from the Spotlight interface.





If you search for a movie or a TV show, for example, and then tap on the result, you&#x27;ll see information like how you can watch the show, t…</span>

                    <span>This year, Apple has already released several new products, including new iPads, the 24-inch iMac, the new Apple TV, and of course, AirTags. Looking ahead to the next few weeks, the list of 2021 Apple products will grow even longer as Apple prepares to reveal the next iPhones, MacBook Pros, and more.



There has been an avalanche of rumors about this year&#x27;s fall season and what Apple has planned for the remainder of 2021. The cloud of product rumors can make it hard to stay updated with what new devices to expect and when. To help, we&#x27;ve created this guide for MacRumors&#x27; readers that outlines what events we could see and what we should expect.

Pages, Numbers, and Keynote icons found in macOS Monterey


The images of the new macOS iWork icons for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are relatively low-resolution given the small size they are displayed at for sharing purposes, but it&#x27;s clear they are a mix of the flat design and solid background colors of the iWork icons first introduced with iOS 7 and the latest macOS versions introduced for Big Sur in November 2020 that feature more photorealistic elements.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The fourth beta comes two weeks after Apple released the third macOS Monterey public beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

The first look at &quot;Finch,&quot; shared by Apple.


The film, which is anticipated to be an awards season contender, revolves around a man, a robot (played by &quot;Get Out&quot; actor Caleb Landry Jones), and a dog that form an unlikely family. Apple describes the film as follows:

                    <span>Apple will likely unveil its next-generation iPhones next month, and ahead of time, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce has outlined its expectations for the devices.





TrendForce said its latest investigations indicate that some of the notable hardware upgrades for the iPhone 13 models will include a faster and more power efficient 5nm+ chip that will presumably be named the A15 Bionic, support for mmWave 5G in additional countries outside the United States, and space-saving internal circuitry that will likely allow for larger batteries inside the devices. All of these features have been rumored previously.



As for pricing, TrendForce believes the iPhone 13 series will be priced similarly as the iPhone 12 series, assuming that Apple is able to effectively control manufacturing costs, due to the lack of many significant hardware upgrades. While the iPhone 12 series was announced in October last year, likely due to pandemic-related delays, the research firm said Apple will return to a September release for the iPhone 13 series this year.



TrendForce said iPhone shipments will likely maintain a growth trajectory in the third quarter of 2021 following the launch of the iPhone 13 series.

                    <span>Apple has teamed up with singer Billie Eilish on a new short film to promote Apple Music&#x27;s recently launched Spatial Audio feature.






The 90-second video, created by Apple Music in close collaboration with Eilish, mashes up the songs &quot;Getting Older&quot; and &quot;GOLDWING&quot; from the artist&#x27;s latest album &quot;Happier Than Ever.&quot; Eilish is seen singing in front of a vanity mirror, and as the song transitions, her reflections start to multiply in additional mirrors surrounding her, which Apple said is a metaphor meant to represent what it&#x27;s like to listen to Spatial Audio.



Apple said Spatial Audio takes the listening experience of the new album to new heights, bringing dimensionality to Eilish&#x27;s vocal performance.



Based on Dolby Atmos, Spatial Audio provides a surround sound experience, making songs sound like they are coming from all around you. Thousands of Apple Music songs have been made available in Spatial Audio since the feature rolled out in June, including Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Rain on Me&quot; and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Black Skinhead,&quot; and Eilish&#x27;s new &quot;Happier Than Ever&quot; album can also be listened to in the immersive audio format.

                    <span>Foxconn, one of Apple&#x27;s largest suppliers, has said it will begin construction of all-electric vehicle plants in the United States and Thailand this year, with hopes of them being operational by 2023, according to a report from Nikkei Asia.





From the report: 

Foxconn, the world&#x27;s largest contract electronics producer, on Thursday said it will build electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Thailand next year, as the key iPhone assembler accelerates efforts to catch the rising EV wave to offset the slowing smartphone industry.



Foxconn has already ruled out Mexico as a location but is in negotiations with three states in the U.S. to build its first EV manufacturing plant in North America, Nikkei Asia has learned. Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.
At first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.



Apple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the Apple Car. One report vaguely referenced Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌Apple Car‌&#x27;s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers. Apple is reportedly committed to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ is produced in the United States, but Foxconn does not produce batteries.

Respiratory rate (RR) is a clinical metric used to assess overall health and physical fitness. In a paper highlighted on the Apple Machine Learning Research website and spotted by MyHealthyApple, researchers found that &quot;wearable headphones&quot; are able to pick up audible inhalations and exhalations during exertion using the device&#x27;s on-board microphones.

                    <span>Zoom has introduced a new feature called Focus Mode that&#x27;s designed to prevent students from distracting each other during virtual classrooms. 





When enabled, Focus Mode allows the teacher or lecturer taking the class to see all the students, while each student can only see the teacher. 



The setting can be activated at any time by the teleconferencing host, so for example it could be turned on for lecture periods to reduce distractions from students&#x27; video feeds and then turned off for group discussion.



Focus Mode is available on the free desktop Zoom client, therefore lending itself to other uses, like business meetings, family gatherings and so on. 





Zoom announced the new feature in a blog post offering other back-to-school tips to get children prepared for virtual or hybrid learning. Version 5.7.5 of Zoom for Mac is available to download from the Zoom website.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/new-iphone-camera-assembly-method/">

                    <span>Apple is reportedly changing up the way it produces camera modules for its iPhone, now opting to individually produce each of the camera lenses separately, rather than procure them together and have them pre-assembled, according to a report from The Elec.





The report notes that up to last year, Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone‌ camera lenses were produced by its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O&#x27;Film. The lenses were &quot;pre-assembled.&quot; Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.

Up to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O&#x27;Film that are pre-assembled.



But it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.
Foxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System. The new system will check whether the wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras&#x27; lenses, including their optical axis and image sensors, are correctly aligned on higher-end ‌iPhone‌ models. An incorrect alignment could result in drastically reduced image quality.



The new changes are being done to &quot;save costs,&quot; but it remains unclear if those savings would be presented to customers. It&#x27;s also unclear whether the new production methodology and Foxconn&#x27;s role in camera assembly will be in practice for the upcoming iPhone 13. Given that the new iPhones are already in production, that&#x27;s unlikely to be the case.

San Francisco leaders on Thursday unveiled some of the nation’s
toughest restrictions on unvaccinated people, barring them from
indoor dining, bars, nightclubs, gyms, large concerts, theaters
and other events held inside. The new rules, which take effect on
Aug. 20, would apply even to people who can show they have tested
negative for the coronavirus.
“This is an important step towards our recovery,” Mayor London
Breed said during a briefing announcing the new requirements. “We
all have to do our part. We need to get vaccinated.”

Philadelphia re-instituted an indoor mask mandate starting today; I hope we follow New York and San Fran with a full-on “vaccinated or stay the fuck home” mandate.

                    <span>Adam Liptak, reporting for The New York Times:
Eight students had sued the university, saying the requirement
violated their constitutional rights to “bodily integrity,
autonomy and medical choice.” But they conceded that exemptions to
the requirement — for religious, ethical and medical reasons — “virtually guaranteed” that anyone who sought an exemption would
be granted one.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who oversees the federal appeals court
in question, turned down the student’s request for emergency
relief without comment. She acted on her own, without referring
the application to the full court, which was an indication that
the application was not on solid legal footing.

                    <span>Charles Gaba:
One thing I’ve been noting is that the R-squared (coefficient of
determination) for the graphs at both the state &amp; county levels
seems to have been inching up higher over the past month or two
… that is, the outlier counties seem to be gradually moving
closer to the graph’s trend line.
Furthermore, the slope of the trend line seemed to be moving
upwards as well over time. Both of these mean that not only is
there a clear correlation between a county’s 2020 partisan lean
and how quickly their residents are getting vaccinated, that
correlation is only increasing over time.
I decided to check to see whether this was an anomaly (just a
temporary thing) or not by going back to the county-level
vaccination data all the way back to February 1st, 2021. At that
point supplies of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were
ramping up, but getting vaccinated was still limited mostly to
senior citizens 65 and older in the United States.
The whole series of charts is telling, but the last one — the animated one that shows how the partisan divide is increasing over time — is startling. The vaccinated aren’t going to forget this.

                    <span>The Hill, reporting on a new Fox News poll:
32 percent of Trump voters say they have no plans to receive one
of the three coronavirus vaccines available in the U.S., compared
to only 3 percent of Biden voters, the poll found.
86 percent of Biden voters say they’ve already been vaccinated,
while 54 percent of Trump voters said the same.
The Republican Party is a death cult. There’s no other way to put it.
And the one person who could most affect this — a man who himself was vaccinated as soon as possible — refuses to say a word.

Like a flaming bag of dog poop passing in the night.
 A while back, I joked on Flyperbole that Flyers fans should erect a wall memorializing all of the awful defenseman the team has employed during the Claude Giroux era. Today, we take a look at an easy inductee for that unfortunate club in Erik Gustafsson, who was so terrible that the Flyers chose to healthy scratch him on occasion for the likes of Nate Prosser.



What exactly happened with Gustafsson this year that warranted frequent utterances of expletives from the mouths of fans? Let’s dive in.

 *Friends, let’s talk about Claude Giroux. The Flyers’ best player. Arguably. Charlie’s got some thoughts about all of this that you ought to read. [The Athletic]
*Getting big time locker room cheerleader vibes from Keith Yandle and his comments about Carter Hart really reinforce this. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Shayne Gostisbehere saga came to an end this summer, and regardless of how you feel about him you have to admit he went out on a high note. [BSH]
*The fine folks over at the Penguins blog seem to believe the Pens will definitely be better than the Flyers this season, which is just adorable. [Pensburgh]
*Somehow, the St. Louis Blues have gone and cocked up this whole Vladimir Tarasenko situation which is... remarkable. Now they’re stuck. [St. Louis Game Time]
*And finally, in case you missed it, a brand new Flyperbole has hit the interwebs! And your esteemed author is the guest, so naturally it’s a lot of fun. [BSH]</span>

Run a radio station, play D&amp;D, and try out a dating app
 Life is Strange: Wavelengths is a prequel to the upcoming Life is Strange: True Colors, and it has a super cozy vibe. Wavelengths is a DLC addition to True Colors, and it doesn’t seem to touch at all on the main mystery of Gabe Chen. Instead, we’re in the shoes of Steph, a young DJ who’s looking to make a mark in the world. Steph’s story plays out over four seasons, and we get to find out more about her and her life before we head into the main plot.
True Colors stars Alex Chen, a young woman who moves to a new city and ends up investigating the death of her brother. Alex is accompanied on her investigation by a supporting cast, which includes Steph, who also showed up in Before the Storm. Wavelengths gives us a little more background on who Steph is, and that may influence the choices players make throughout the story of True Colors.
The soundtrack includes songs from Girl in Red, Alt-J, Portugal, The Man, Foals, Hayley Kiyoko, and Maribou State. As Steph becomes more comfortable as a DJ, the player gets to see other aspects of her life. This includes running a D&amp;D game with a friend, using the D20 to give callers advice on the radio, and swiping left or right on profiles during Pride month. 
The entire DLC looks incredibly cozy, and it’ll be interesting to see how it adds to the main story. True Colors is set to be released on Sept. 10; Wavelengths will release soon after on Sept. 30.</span>

No, my spectral charge is ALSO named Bort
 League of Legends is in an interesting spot right now when it comes to lore, as its big world-spanning event has come to a close. Now that the Sentinels of Light have put down the Ruined King and saved the world, things should be pretty peaceful, right? Well, the event left a lot of loose threads hanging, like the fate of characters like Karma, Shyvana, or Thresh. On Thursday, Riot released a new cinematic that answers at least a few of those questions.
The cinematic stars Thresh, who is a spectral warden from the Shadow Isles. In the Sentinels of Light event, he gathered up all of the power from Viego’s scary invasion and used it to craft himself a different form. With this new, mostly human form, Thresh is free to wander the world. This cinematic is an immediate follow-up that shows us what he’s doing with his freedom, and it’s nothing good! He’s back to shackling and torturing souls inside his scary lantern, but at least he’s appointing middle management to help out. In this case, that’s an unfortunate tavern keep called Bort with a crab claw for an arm.
This cinematic also shows Thresh in a different light than his in-game splash art. Instead of having his sick abs out for everyone to admire, he appears much more sinister and skeletal in this one. Even when he’s just in the tavern, pretending to be a normal guy, you can tell there’s something off there. It’s a great rendition of the character, and it’ll be intriguing to see where his story leads.</span>

Another chance to meet Clyde, Tommy, and CJ
 Rockstar Games may be releasing remasters of three classic Grand Theft Auto Games, according to a report from Kotaku. This remains unconfirmed, but the remastered version of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are rumored to arrive on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and mobile devices.
Kotaku’s report suggests that the games will be “a mix of new and old graphics,” akin to a “heavily-modded version of a classic GTA title.” The UI of the games will be updated for clarity as well, though it’ll remain the classic visual style. Gameplay is expected to remain as close as possible to the original iterations.
These three titles are part of the “3D universe” of Rockstar Games, which include the PS2 era of Grand Theft Auto before the series moved into high definition with Grand Theft Auto 4. While these games aren’t quite as fleshed out or involved as Rockstar’s modern titles, they still remain classics. Lines from San Andreas, like CJ’s iconic “Ah, shit, here we go again,” remain a popular part of the zeitgeist.
Kotaku says Rockstar Dundee, a Scottish studio, is heading up development on these remastered titles. It’s unclear when they might be released, especially due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it seems as though it will likely be in one bundle.
Rockstar also reportedly has plans for a Red Dead Redemption remaster.
We’ve reached out to Rockstar for comment, and will update this story should it respond with additional information.</span>

Oil replaces coal in a sequel just as brutal as the original
 Oil is coming to the apocalyptic world of Frostpunk in 11 bit studios’ reveal trailer for Frostpunk 2. The sequel takes place 30 years after the story in the original game, and will see players lead another society through the newly imposed ice age. Societies that were once built on coal will now be built on oil, and leaders will need quiet any rebellions that question their rule.
The original Frostpunk launched to critical acclaim in 2018 on PC; 11 bit studios eventually ported the game to consoles and added numerous expansion packs. In Frostpunk, players build a circular city centered around an engine. The world is frozen over, and citizens need to gather coal to increase the engine’s output or r…</span>

Michael K. Williams returns as ‘Irish’ from Battlefield 4
 Battlefield 2042 won’t feature a traditional narrative single-player campaign, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carry over storytelling elements from previous games — or that it won’t tell stories of its own. In a newly released short film titled “Exodus,” developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts set up the story of Battlefield 2042 and confirm the return of a beloved character: Battlefield 4’s Kimble “Irish” Graves, once again played by Michael K. Williams.
The nine-minute film appears to confirm a canonical ending for 2013’s Battlefield 4: that Irish, not Huang “Hannah” Shuyi, survives the events of that game’s campaign. As such, Irish will be a playable “No-Pat” Specialist in Battlefield 2042. 
“Exodus” also introduces a new character to Battlefield lore named Oz. He clashes with Irish over the future of the No-Pats — 2042’s nickname for the non-patriated soldiers who fight in the upcoming game’s global conflict. EA said in a news released that the story of Battlefield 2042 will “continue to evolve over time” and will be told through future playable specialists — not unlike how EA’s Apex Legends or Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch handle their storytelling.
Irish is the fifth confirmed specialist coming in Battlefield 2042, following Casper, Mackay, Boris, and Falck, who were revealed in June. Battlefield 2042 is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.</span>

Vanguard will take players back to World War II
 Call of Duty fans appear to be heading back to World War II later this year with the next entry in the franchise, which is called Call of Duty: Vanguard, according to leaked images posted online.
Charlie Intel reports that the new season 5 update for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War contained some hidden files showcasing pre-order details for 2021’s Call of Duty title. Data miners pulled the images and started sharing them online. Activision has met some of these posts with copyright takedown notices, forcing them to be removed.
The images themselves seem legitimate, suggesting that Call of Duty: Vanguard will be the game’s official title and that it will be set during WWII.

                    <span>In a paper published in 2017, Todd Kashdan and his colleagues identified five distinct dimensions of curiosity. Here are the first three:
1. Joyous Exploration. This is the prototype of curiosity — the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.
2. Deprivation Sensitivity. This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.
3. Stress Tolerance. This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.


They also identified four types of curious people: The Fascinated, Problem Solvers, Empathizers, and Avoiders. (via the art of noticing)

                    <span>The YouTube channel In Depth Cine has been looking at how directors like Spike Lee, Alfonso Cuarón, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson shoot films at three different budget levels, from the on-a-shoestring films early in their careers to later blockbusters, to see the similarities and differences in their approaches. For instance, Wes Anderson made Bottle Rocket for $5 million, Rushmore for $10 million, and Grand Budapest Hotel for $25 million:

Steven Spielberg shot Duel for $450,000, Raiders of the Lost Ark for $20 million, and Saving Private Ryan for $70 million:

Christopher Nolan did Following for $6,000, Memento for $9 million, and Inception for $160 million:

You can find the full playlist of 3 Budget Levels videos here. (This list really needs some female directors — Ava DuVernay, Sofia Coppola, and Kathryn Bigelow would be easy to do, for starters. And Chloé Zhao, after The Eternals gets released.)

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/ios-15-wifi-5g-developer-tool/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released a new developer tool that is designed to force devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 to priortize a 5G connection over a WiFi connection when on an insecure WiFi network or when a WiFi connection is slow.




5G devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 can automatically prioritize connecting via 5G instead of WiFi when the performance of WiFi networks you visit occasionally is slow, or when you are connected to captive or insecure WiFi networks. Install the 5G Preferred Over Wi-Fi profile (&quot;profile&quot;) on devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 Beta 4 or greater to greatly increase the likelihood of seeing 5G preferred over Wi-Fi connections and to ensure your networking path logic is optimized for situations where 5G will be preferred. For more information, see https://developer.apple.com/5g/.
Apple says that developers who want to prioritize 5G usage on their devices can do so by running the fourth beta of ‌iOS 15‌/‌iPadOS 15‌ or later and downloading the 5G Preferred Over WiFi Profile.



In iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple has already added a new feature that causes 5G devices to automatically prioritize 5G when it provides an improved connection over WiFi, so this developer tool should boost that capability even further.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the fifth beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The fifth beta comes two weeks after Apple released the fourth macOS Monterey beta, and it is available to both developers and public beta testers. 





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. Public beta testers can install the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s public beta testing website. 



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the fifth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming two weeks after Apple released the fourth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

                    <span>New bipartisan antitrust legislation that targets Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google&#x27;s Play Store was today introduced by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, and Amy Klobuchar.





The Open App Markets Act [PDF] is meant to create &quot;fair, clear, and enforceable rules&quot; that will protect competition and strengthen consumer protections. According to the three senators, Apple and Google have &quot;gatekeeper control&quot; of the two main mobile operating systems and their app stores, allowing them to dictate the terms of the app market.

                    <span>Apple has begun selling a new third-party accessory for its MagSafe ecosystem, a folding stand from OtterBox priced at $39.95. The hinged stand includes a recessed area to house a user-provided ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and a slot for routing the cable through the stand and out the back.





The folding design is convenient for travel and lets you set your desired angle for nightstand viewing, video calls, and more in either portrait or landscape orientation. When folded completely back into a horizontal position, it can serve as a traditional Qi charger for non-MagSafe devices such as AirPods or other smartphones.



At $39.95 for the stand and an additional $39.00 for Apple&#x27;s ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, it&#x27;s not an inexpensive charging solution, but the removable charger setup does offer flexibility to only use the stand when needed.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Popular to-do app Things reached version 3.14 today and gained several additional note-related features: Bullet Lists, Markdown support, Find in Text, and Things Cloud &quot;Fractus.&quot;





Things has supported bullet lists before now, but you can now nest lists by inserting spaces in front of a bullet, and character lines now line up with the text of the previous line, thanks to the use of a fixed-width font.



When editing bullet lists, Things will now make the process a little easier by automatically stripping out &quot;double bullets&quot; during copy-paste.



Meanwhile, there&#x27;s a new Find in Text option that augments the existing search by searching specific notes. The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. 



In addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.





Lastly, Things Cloud &quot;Fractus&quot; is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. 



With Things Cloud &quot;Fractus&quot;, however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. 



Things 3.14 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $49.99 and from the iOS App Store. The iPad version is priced at $19.99 [Direct Link] while the iPhone version (which includes Apple Watch support) is priced at $9.99. [Direct Link] A 15-day trial of Things for Mac is available on the Cultured Code website.

                    <span>Samsung today unveiled a series of new products at a virtual event, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 foldable smartphones, Galaxy Buds 2 wireless earbuds, and Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch.

Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Flip 3


A key new feature of the Fold 3 is an uninterrupted 7.6-inch inner display with a 4-megapixel camera embedded under the screen, whereas the Fold 2 had a hole-punch camera. This is in addition to a trio of 12-megapixel rear lenses and a 10-megapixel front camera.

                    <span>One of the biggest hurdles for customers looking to switch between Android and iOS is their inability to transfer their WhatsApp chats between the two different ecosystems. Now, that&#x27;s coming to an end, as WhatsApp has officially announced that it will easily allow users to transfer their chats between Android and iOS.





As reported first by Engadget, WhatsApp used airtime during Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy Unpacked event to announce the new feature. WhatsApp tested the feature for the past few weeks and said it was difficult to implement due to &quot;end-to-end encryption,&quot; requiring added assistance to make it work. 



The feature will first arrive on Android devices, specifically Samsung smartphones, allowing users to initially transfer chats from iOS to Samsung smartphones. The transfer will include the chat itself, photos, videos, and voice memos, and should be available to Samsung users in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; WhatsApp has not said when the feature will arrive for a wider range of WhatsApp devices and on iOS.

                    <span>BlueJeans Telehealth has today announced that it will integrate with Apple&#x27;s Health app to give more contextual information to healthcare providers.





BlueJeans Telehealth is a HIPAA-ready virtual care system that provides a way for healthcare providers to meet with their patients via a video call, integrating with the workflows of clinical teams to replicate the experience of onsite encounters.



The BlueJeans Telehealth app will now allow patients to share specific categories of health data from Apple&#x27;s Health app, including heart rate, ECGs, step count, mobility data, sleep, and falls, with their healthcare provider during telehealth appointments, via HealthKit. 



Patients can specifically control which encrypted health data they wish to share while supplying healthcare providers with additional information to give more informed advice.



Health data can be selected within the pre-visit patient landing experience or through the televisit tile during the session. Once synced, the healthcare provider will be able to see, expand, and interact with the Apple Health app data, allowing them to observe trends and highlight data on-screen for the patient.

The new update is a considerable update, featuring refinements that make it easier for users to track, manage, and keep an eye on potentially vulnerable passwords. One of the first changes relates to shared password vaults, where 1Password 8 will now offer more visual representation for what passwords are being shared with who. 





You&#x27;ll also notice an indicator next to each shared vault, making it easier to see which vaults are private and which are shared. No guesswork. And items show who they&#x27;re being shared with.

                    <span>Apple today shared a new &quot;Today at Apple&quot; session on YouTube, exploring how to shoot and edit looping videos in the Clips app, with the help of director Romain Laurent and Jahmyra from Today at Apple. 






Viewers are encouraged to get involved simply with an iPhone and the Clips app, but may also wish to take advantage of a selfie stick or tripod.



The session covers how to make a simple loop video, match your movement, add an unexpected feature, finalizing looped videos, top takeaways, and export videos.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌iPhone‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the third Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with the first exploring how to draw yourself as a &quot;Peanuts&quot; character in the Pages app using an ‌iPad‌ and ‌Apple Pencil‌ and the second explaining how to shoot and edit &quot;otherworldly&quot; photos with Night Mode.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/airpods-find-my-support-apple-id-and-process/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple announced earlier this year that, with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the Find My Network will be able to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the AirPods to a specific Apple ID, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌&#x27;s speaker holes to remove the linked account.





First spotted by 9to5Mac, iOS 15 developer beta five code has confirmed that, to work with Apple&#x27;s ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else&#x27;s ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner&#x27;s ‌Apple ID‌.



To remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.



For ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.



Support for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.



Previously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device&#x27;s location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.

                    <span>Mozilla has announced the public release of Firefox 91, featuring an enhanced version of its Total Cookie Protection for individual websites.





When you browse the web on your devices, websites will often leave cookies on your system so that they can remember you and what your preferences are.



Some cookies are genuinely useful, as they allow sites to save your personal information (such as your login credentials) so that you don&#x27;t have to keep entering it every time you visit. However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. 





To combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can&#x27;t track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.



With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.



Firefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.





For Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using &quot;Clear cookies and site data&quot; in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.



In addition, there&#x27;s a new &quot;Forget About This Site&quot; option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.



Firefox 91 is available now from the Mozilla website.

                    <span>Apple this week dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Corellium, the security research company that provides security researchers with a replica of the iOS operating system, allowing them to locate possible security exploits within Apple&#x27;s mobile operating system, The Washington Post reports.





Apple filed a lawsuit against Corellium in 2019, claiming the security company was infringing upon its copyrights of iOS and iPhone. Last year, a judge dismissed Apple&#x27;s claim that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant&#x27;s copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. 



While Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.



Citing court documents, The Washington Post reports that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple&#x27;s grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.



Likely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year launched a program that would give security researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching security vulnerabilities and exploits.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple this week began selling refurbished 8th-generation iPad models through its online store in the United States for the first time since the device was released last year. As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.





Apple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.



Introduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.



Refurbished iPads are covered by Apple&#x27;s standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.



Apple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week. While certified refurbished iPads represent a decent opportunity for savings straight from Apple, better deals are sometimes available from resellers like Amazon and Best Buy. Be sure to monitor our Apple Deals roundup for the latest discounts on Apple products.

                    <span>Terrific interview — great questions, asked in the right order:
Panzarino: One of the bigger queries about this system is
that Apple has said that it will just refuse action if it is asked

government to compromise the system?
Neuenschwander: Well first, that is launching only for U.S.,

There’s about 10 minutes of hockey talk in this one.
 Kelly Hinkle joins Steve to discuss Carter Hart’s new contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, a Bach Update, Woodstock 99, and Guy Fieri’s newest creation - the apple pie hot dog. It’s a Flyperbole trifecta.

The former third-round pick finished up his final season in Philadelphia trending up, but not enough to prevent him from being dealt away as part of a defensive overhaul. 
 After the Flyers failed to quality for the 2020-21 Stanley Cup playoffs, GM Chuck Fletcher set out to overhaul a underperforming defensive group — one that had included Shayne Gostisbehere for the better part six-plus seasons. 
The 28-year-old, who narrowly lost out on the Calder Trophy back in a breakout 2015-16 season, was no longer in Fletcher’s plans moving forward on defense and was dealt to the Arizona Coyotes for the low price of second and seventh-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft.

 *Have we mentioned that August is boring? Well, August is boring. No one reads the links anyway. Anyhoo, player reviews continue in earnest with the ones that got away. Next up, Phil Myers. [BSH]
*Seems clear that Carter Hart is a more loose, happier, back-to-himself person now than he was last season. Which has to bode well for us. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers are now spending pretty big on their back end, and Chuck clearly thinks that the increase in salary will translate into an increase in favorable results. [Inquirer]
*Making a full-season NHL schedule is a nightmare and the Olympics only make it worse. [ESPN]
*And finally, if the offseason is good for anything is a series of fun Down Goes Brown thought exercises. This time? Which team can make the best six-team roster of players drafted in different rounds. Why not eh? [The Athletic]</span>

The never-ending quest to balance rifles continues
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s new season may have been delayed by a day, but that hasn’t stopped Treyarch from revealing the patch notes. The developer released the change list for the new season on Wednesday, giving players a preview of new updates to assault rifle balance, pistol nerfs, and the season’s new content. 
The biggest change in this patch is the assault rifle balance update, which touches several different weapons in the category. The weapon with the most changes is the XM4 rifle, which has several attachments adjusted to help give each attachment a more unique role. 
This patch also changes the FFAR 1. It will now have more damage up close, but slightly less at longer distances. The p…</span>

Welcome to Bandle City
 The world of Legends of Runeterra is about to get a whole lot cuter. On Wednesday, Riot Games released an animated trailer revealing the next set of champions and locations from League of Legends to come to the franchise’s card game. Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards. This includes 9 new champions, including some from outside Bandle City like the Piltover sheriff Caitlyn.
The new expansion will also have new keywords that reflect the whimsical nature of the Yordles. In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.
It also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her. However, the bulk of the Bandlewood expansion should focus on yordles and their mischief. Beyond the Bandlewood is set to release on Aug. 25.</span>

 Pop star Ariana Grande has come to Fortnite, and with her arrival comes a much-needed dose of glam. 
Grande descended onto the humble Tomato Town for a virtual concert, and with her, she brought a set of aesthetic items for players to purchase. Fans had the opportunity to buy two Ariana Grande skins — each of which rocked her iconic high-pony — and other battle items like a sparking glider and a diamond-like hammer.

NASCAR 21: Ignition, made in Unreal 4, will launch Oct. 28 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. It’s the second NASCAR title published by new label Motorsport Games, a subsidiary of the global media company Motorsport Network, best known for its Motorsport.com website.
“It’s a product that we’ve been building for over two years; it is a built-from-scratch product,” Dmitry Kozko, Motorsport Games’ chief executiv…</span>

The next big sensation might be here
 Hell Let Loose looks generic at first glance — it’s a World War II shooter with tanks, guns, and explosions. If you’re not paying attention and you click on a random stream of the game, it looks like a scene you’ve seen a hundred times before. But developer Black Matter expertly threads the genre needle between goofy, Looney Tunes multiplayer chaos and hardcore military sim precision, resulting in one of the best online shooters around right now.
Hell Let Loose is very clever with its simple premise. It&#x27;s a 50 vs. 50 battle, and the map is divided into sections. Players win by taking over the sections and out-maneuvering the enemy. There are traditional classes, like Scout, Medic, Engineer, Officer, or Tank Commande…</span>

Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s new season won’t start until Friday
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s new seasons are almost here, but they’re not as close as they used to be. Treyarch announced on Wednesday that it is delaying the season 5 patch by 24 hours, meaning that it won’t be released until Friday — or really late Thursday for some time zones. 
Treyarch revealed the new features for Call of Duty season 5 last week, when it announced that it would include a new game mode all about double-crossing your friends. The season will also include five new multiplayer maps and weapons like the TEC-9, EM2 assault rifle, and the Marshall handgun. As usual, some of this content will be released when the season actually goes live,…</span>

This is incredibly serious business
 The latest Dead by Daylight patch looks pretty normal at first glance — there’s a buff to K-Pop killer the Trickster, and a host of bug fixes. But if you look a little closer, you’ll see a suspicious note that reads, “Fixed an issue that caused The Executioner’s rear to be too flat.”
The Executioner is Pyramid Head, the iconic Silent Hill villain. When he joined the fray back in June of 2020, fans celebrated his enormous ass. Dead by Daylight is all about being chased by a host of nefarious Killers, and some people like it when those Killers have a big butt. When developer Behaviour tweaked the Killer’s blood-stained smock, fans raised a fuss about how it looked. Had the developers dared to touch that perfect behind…</span>

Taking the train toward adventure
 Eastward, a charming adventure title from Shanghai developer Pixpil, will come to Nintendo Switch this September. The release was announced at Wednesday’s Nintendo Indie World showcase. Eastward was originally announced in 2018 and is planned for Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac.
The game takes place in a fantasy world where society is on the brink of collapse and the population is declining. The player assumes the role of protagonists John and Sam, and uses their unique abilities to explore cozy towns, mysterious lairs, and toxic wastes. The world is plagued by a toxic miasma, and humanity has fled underground. John and Sam — a miner and a mysterious young girl with a frying pan and kinetic powers, respectively — decide to see what has happened to the world outside of the underground sanctuaries and set out on a road trip across the rails. 
Eastward is published by Chucklefish, who also published Stardew Valley and Risk of Rain, as well as developed Starbound and Wargroove. Eastward seems to fit perfectly within that portfolio, and fans will be able to crack into the strange world this September.</span>

A slightly more tactical twist on the run-and-gun franchise
 Metal Slug Tactics is coming to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo announced that the latest game in the Metal Slug franchise is on its way to the platform during its August Nintendo Indie World event. 
Metal Slug is known for its run-and-gun shooting, but the latest entry switches things up a bit with turn-based tactical gameplay. Metal Slug Tactics is all about approaching fights strategically and placing your troops in the correct positions for special bonuses. The game also adds roguelike elements to help keep each run fresh. 
But not everything about Metal Slug Tactics is new. The game still keeps the pixel-art graphics fans are used to from the Metal Slug franchise, along with some of its characters like Marco, Tarma, Fio, and Eri. Of course, since it’s a Metal Slug game, there are still plenty of guns and explosions too.
Metal Slug Tactics is set to come to Nintendo Switch and PC sometime in 2022.</span>

Tom Happ’s sequel to his 2015 Metroidvania available in eShop
 And just like that, Axiom Verge 2 arrives today for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC.
Tom Happ’s long-anticipated sequel to his acclaimed 2015 Metroidvania will be available Wednesday in the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Store, and Epic Games Store. Axiom Verge 2 was shown during Wednesday’s Indie World showcase with a new trailer (above). 
In the first Axiom Verge, the player character is a researcher named Trace, who awakens from a laboratory accident on an alien world. As Trace, the player explores a glitched-out landscape, repairing code to continue their progress through each level.
Axiom Verge 2 was announced during an Indie World presentation in 2019, and originally scheduled to launch in the fall of 2020. However, it was delayed twice, most recently in May, and given a launch window for the third quarter of this year.
Happ is still largely the project’s sole developer; it took him five years to deliver the first Axiom Verge. That was a PlayStation 4 game when it launched in 2015, and was later ported to Wii U in 2016 and then the Switch in 2017.
A documentary about the first game’s creation was published in 2017; Happ made it free to watch via IGN back in May.</span>

                    <span>In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.
Cognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.
The power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.


I particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:
Daily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.

                    <span>For the FT, Tim Harford writes about things that could have been invented far sooner than they actually were.
Consider the bicycle. It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.
Anton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.
Steven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.

                    <span>In the first part of a multi-video series on how the human immune system works, Kurzgesagt describes how the system’s first lines of defense work when your body is invaded by microorganisms.
The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know, after the human brain, and yet, most of us never learn how it works. Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. 
It is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.


Kurzgesagt founder Philipp Dettmer is publishing a companion book to the series, Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive; it’s out in late September.
I have read a lot about the human immune system over the past 18 months, but this video was still helpful in understanding how it all fits together. For more information, consult their extensive list of sources or watch their earlier video on what the SARS-CoV-2 virus does to a human body.

A refresher on Apple&#x27;s new child safety features from our previous coverage:
First, an optional Communication Safety feature in the Messages app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac can warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos. When the feature is enabled, Apple said the Messages app will use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments, and if a photo is determined to be sexually explicit, the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s Head of Privacy, Erik Neuenschwander, has responded to some of users&#x27; concerns around the company&#x27;s plans for new child safety features that will scan messages and Photos libraries, in an interview with TechCrunch.





When asked why Apple is only choosing to implement child safety features that scan for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Neuenschwander explained that Apple has &quot;now got the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy,&quot; giving the company &quot;a new ability to identify accounts which are starting collections of known CSAM.&quot;



Neuenschwander was asked if, in retrospect, announcing the Communication Safety features in Messages and the CSAM detection system in iCloud Photos together was the right decision, to which he responded:

                    <span>The 2022 iPhones and Macs may feature chips built on the 3nm process, as Apple&#x27;s leading chip supplier, TSMC, is planning to begin mass production for 3nm chips destined for Apple in the second half of next year, according to a preview of an upcoming report by DigiTimes. 





The paywalled preview of the full report, which will be published tomorrow, reads: 

TSMC is on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022 for Apple&#x27;s devices, either iPhones or Mac computers, according to industry sources.
Earlier in June, TSMC was reportedly beefing up capacity to begin production of 3nm chips, but DigiTimes at the time refrained from mentioning Apple as a potential initial beneficiary of the new process. Today&#x27;s preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.



Apple has already reportedly booked TSMC&#x27;s entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. 



The A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year&#x27;s iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. 



The full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple&#x27;s plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We&#x27;ll be sure to let MacRumors&#x27; readers know if the new report shares anything of significance.

                    <span>Apple plans to launch a new MacBook Air with a mini-LED display and several color options around mid 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors. These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.




A colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser


Kuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an &quot;all-new design&quot; with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. 



Kuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.



Chinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. 



Apple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.

                    <span>Twelve South today announced a new addition to its PlugBug charger lineup with the launch of the PlugBug Slim, a new 20W USB-C charger that&#x27;s useful for travel with its thin design.





Priced at $24.99, Twelve South describes the PlugBug Slim as a space-saving charger that&#x27;s 0.67 inches thick (17mm), so it better blends into the wall and fits into tight spaces where furniture might be close to an outlet.



The prongs of the PlugBug Slim are designed to fold down so that it can be tucked into a pocket or slipped into a bag or purse when on the go, and there&#x27;s a small light at the bottom to let you know when your device is charging.





The PlugBug Slim is a GaN charger, and while there are many GaN charging options on the market now with compact designs, there are fewer that have focused on a slimmer profile for small spaces. At 20W, the PlugBug Slim works with the iPhone models and offers fast charging, charges up the iPad, and supports the HomePod mini.



Twelve South&#x27;s PlugBug Slim can be purchased from the Twelve South website for $24.99.

                    <span>Several retailers today have Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro at $189.99, down from $249.00. You&#x27;ll find this sale price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.

This has been the most popular discount price on the AirPods Pro for 2021. We have seen the AirPods Pro dip below $189.99 in the past, but those were mainly for sales around the holidays and they&#x27;ve been extremely rare since then.

For the lower-cost model, only Amazon has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for $113.99, down from $159.00. This new sale price beats the previous popular deal on the AirPods by about $6, and it&#x27;s the best deal online right now.

Lastly, the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is marked down to $129.98 at Walmart, from $199.00, which is an all-time low on this model of the AirPods. It is being matched at Amazon, but due to stock shortages you won&#x27;t see a shipping date in August at that retailer.

                    <span>Two popular Japanese prepaid money cards will be gaining support for Apple Pay later this year, allowing the cards to be added to the Wallet app for contactless payments using an iPhone or Apple Watch where accepted, it was announced today. 





The cards set to gain Apple Pay support include Seven &amp; I&#x27;s Nanaco card and AEON&#x27;s WAON card, as noted by Ata Distance. The blog, which focuses on mobile payment and transit cards in Japan, believes it will likely become possible to add the cards to the Wallet app shortly after the public release of iOS 15, which is expected in September.





As part of its Apple Pay announcement, Seven &amp; I said it has issued around 74 million Nanaco cards that are accepted at around 800,000 retail locations in Japan, including 7-Eleven and Ito-Yokado stores. Likewise, AEON said it has issued over 87 million WAON cards that are accepted at more than 840,000 retail locations across the island country.  



Apple Pay continues to expand to more issuers around the world, including ING in Belgium and FNB in South Africa earlier this month.

In an extensive Twitter thread, Stamos said that there are &quot;no easy answers&quot; in the debate around child protection versus personal privacy.



Stamos expressed his frustration with the way in which Apple handled the announcement of the new features and criticized the company for not engaging in wider industry discussions around the safety and privacy aspects of end-to-end encryption in recent years.

                    <span>Apple display supplier Samsung is in the early stages of preparing its production line for OLED displays that are expected to be used in future models of the MacBook Pro, according to new information shared today by The Elec.





The report says that Samsung Display has begun early development of a new production process for OLED displays. This new production capacity will be used by Apple for future OLED MacBooks, according to the report. 



DigiTimes has reported that Apple is tentatively scheduled to release a 16 to 17-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022. Apple is also reportedly planning a 10.9-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro with OLED displays for the same year. 



Apple just this year released a new ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display and is expected to be just weeks away from launching updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with similar display technology. DigiTimes said that Apple would allow ‌iPad‌ and MacBook models with OLED and mini-LED displays, which are considerably different technologies, to coexist within their respective product lineups. 



Apple currently uses OLED displays in its flagship iPhones, Apple Watch models, and the Touch Bar in the current MacBook Pros. The company has yet to expand OLED technology to other products.

                    <span>Speaking of Mark Gurman, his Power On newsletter continues to be an excellent read. His main topic this week argues that Apple TV (hardware) is “mostly pointless”:
Most importantly, buying an Apple TV no longer gives users a
content advantage. We are in the age of streaming services like
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, and business models have
shifted so that every service is available on every device — phones, tablets, TV sets, streaming sticks and game consoles.
Apple, known for its closed ecosystem, is even embracing the shift
by offering many services on smart TVs and boxes made by
competitors. […] That made the Apple TV a mostly pointless
accessory, and consumers seem to agree: 2020 data from Strategy
Analytics found that the Apple TV holds 2% of the streaming
device market.

                    <span>Mark Gurman, with a few scoops on the upcoming new iPhones:
Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and
it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a person in
sharp focus while blurring the background in what is known as a
bokeh effect. For the new iPhones, Apple plans to add this same
technique to video with a feature internally dubbed Cinematic
Video. Like with still photos, the iPhone’s depth sensor will
create the effect and allow users to change the amount of blur
after recording. […]
Another feature will let users better control the look of colors
and highlights in their pictures. Users will be able to choose
from several styles to apply to their photos, including one for
showing colors at either a warmer or cooler temperature while

                    <span>Goodbye, leaf-eater; we hardly knew ya.
 The Flyers had a letdown season in 2020-21, but perhaps no single player had a more brutal year in terms of on-ice performance than Phil Myers. Coming off of a promising 2019-20 campaign where he flashed talent befitting a second pair defender, the 24-year-old right hander hugely underwhelmed and at points didn’t even look like an NHL player. Now traded to the Nashville Predators in a package including Nolan Patrick for Ryan Ellis, Myers is no longer a player that Flyers fans really need to invest their attention in. That said, it’s important to investigate what led to his eventual departure from Broad Street. Let’s dig in.

 *Carter Hart’s locked up for three years and if the stars align in two year’s time we will be praising Chuck to the heavens for getting him so cheap. [BSH]
*It’s a gamble though! No getting around it. [Inquirer]
*Hart gave a presser and did a little Q&amp;A after the contract was announced, and if you missed it, here you go. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers’ signing kicked off a few more goalie signings, with the Caps resigning their guy for only a year. No gambles taken there. [Japers’ Rink]
*And then the Rangers locked up their guy for way more money and one more year than the Flyers gave Carter Hart. [Blueshirt Banter]
*Anyhoo, we’ve said goodbye to Jake Voracek. Let’s look back at his final season with the team. [BSH]
*A rundown of the best bargains of the summer thus far proves Chuck did well at least once. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And a rundown of the riskiest contracts doesn’t reveal and Chuck mistakes. This also includes the safest contracts too, just so we’re all clear. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, the poor owners. The poor billionaire owners. They simply can’t pay their players more, not now. No no. Not for a few years, either. [The Athletic]</span>

A modder added the popular traversal tool to another open-world game
 No, that’s not Link floating across the land of Skyrim. It’s the Dragonborn. 
Thanks to a new mod that adds Link’s paraglider from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Skyrim, you can now float across the land just like the hero of time would. The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. 
The “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. 
In the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.
Similar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. 
The mod doesn&#x27;t add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!</span>

Players who pre-ordered get in Aug. 13, general public can play Aug. 20
 Diablo 2: Resurrected’s multiplayer beta begins this weekend, Blizzard announced on Tuesday. Players who pre-ordered the remaster of the 2000 dungeon crawler will get in on an early access weekend starting Friday afternoon, with the public open beta following the next weekend.
The early access period starts Friday, Aug. 13 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and is available to those with a pre-order for Diablo 2: Resurrected or the Diablo Prime Evil Collection (a special edition with some extra in-game stuff for $20 more).
The open beta starts Friday, Aug. 20 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT. This beta and the early access beta include all platforms except Nintendo Switch. Players may try out cross-progression support on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions.
Blizzard says both betas will allow players to try out five classes: Paladin, Druid, Barbarian, Amazon, and Sorceress. The multiplayer component will support up to eight players in PvP or PvE play.
Both beta periods will be limited to the game’s Act I: The Sightless Eye and Act II: The Secret of the Vizjerei. But there will be no level cap, so players can try out a variety of builds for as long as they want to progress in these two acts.
Blizzard’s official blog post has more details. Diablo 2: Resurrected launches Sept. 23.
Blizzard first announced Diablo 2: Resurrected at BlizzConline earlier this year. At the time, executive producer Rod Ferguson stressed that Resurrected is a remaster, not a remake. 
In a technical alpha held in April, we found Diablo 2 was just as faithful a re-release as Blizzard had promised, and that its controller support made all the difference for newer players.</span>

A promising cyberpunk shooter without the confidence to see things through
 There’s no denying it: The Ascent has style. It’s drenched in neon and thrumming with decay. What’s not coated in chrome is swallowed by rust, and though it draws on the usual cyberpunk influences — Neo-Tokyo, Midgar, dystopian Los Angeles, to name a few — I can’t help getting lost in its singular energy. 
Of course, style can go only so far. To quote William Gibson, “When you want to know how things really work, study them when they’re coming apart.” The Ascent frequently comes apart. It’s a collision of genres that, even at its best, can’t decide what it wants to be.

The new patch also lets players customize their crosshairs in even more detail
 Valorant’s first patch in nearly three weeks has arrived, and the biggest change is a bug fix that’s technically a huge nerf to Viper’s Ultimate. The patch also includes more customizable crosshairs, and the ability to shoot through more parts of maps than before. 
At the beginning of Valorant’s latest season, Riot released a patch that allowed Viper to place her Viper’s Pit Ultimate ability wherever her crosshair was pointing, rather than at her feet, like it was previously. This turned out to be a massive buff to the Agent, since she could place the ability in hard-to-reach places and throw it out while safe behind cover. The only problem was, Riot didn’t intend for this to happen. …</span>

 The latest throwback mini console is an homage to a home computer — the Commodore Amiga 500, reborn as The A500 Mini from Retro Games Ltd, the same company behind 2018’s C64 Mini.

Classic gaming fans will find 25 Amiga staples in the A500’s onboard library of games — among them Interplay’s 1991 hit Another World, the 1993 point-and-click adventure Simon the Sorcerer, steampunk run-and-gunner The Chaos Engine (which was later ported to home consoles of the day), and Team 17’s 1995 hit Worms (as Worms: The Director’s Cut), which launched a franc…</span>

                    <span>The 2020 Summer Olympics are over, but it’s never too late to find inspiration in the athletes who competed. For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.
“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”


Armanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:
Those distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”

                    <span>Check out Italian photographer Paolo Pettigiani’s photos of the evaporation ponds of Camargue, France. While these ponds are industrially harvested for their salt, the pink color of the water is naturally occurring in the salt marshes of the area, caused by halophile dunaliella salina algae. The area is also an important bird habitat and is one of the few places in Europe that flamingos live, which might seem like a coincidence until you learn that flamingos gain their pink color from eating the algae and shrimp that also feed on the algae.

Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion — such as continued sea level rise — are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.

                    <span>Apple today began offering refurbished versions of the second-generation 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models that were originally released in March 2020.





Pricing starts at $609 for the 11-inch iPad Pro models, which Apple says is a savings of $90. Pricing on the 12.9-inch models starts at $749, a $200 discount.



The 2020 ‌iPad Pro‌ models preceeded the M1 ‌iPad Pro‌ models and introduced new camera technology with an included LiDAR Scanner for depth-sensing capabilities. These iPads are equipped with the A12Z Bionic Chip, an iterative update to the A12X chip that was used for the 2018 ‌iPad Pro‌ models.

At the current time, Apple is offering several different colors and capacities, though stock will fluctuate over time. The refurbished 2020 ‌iPad Pro‌ models are being sold alongside older models in the refurbished store.



All of Apple&#x27;s refurbished iPads are sold with the same one-year warranty that&#x27;s provided with a brand new device, along with all manuals and accessories. Refurbished devices go through a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process and are identical to new devices.

                    <span>In April, Apple debuted the new M1 iMac models with a dedicated Touch ID keyboard, marking the first time that ‌Touch ID‌ was available on a standalone keyboard option. At launch, the Magic Keyboard with ‌Touch ID‌ was only available with the iMac, but last week, Apple made it available to purchase separately from the ‌iMac‌.

Employees of Teleperformance in Colombia, a major call center company used by Apple, have raised concerns about lengthy new contracts that allow them to be monitored by AI-powered cameras installed in their homes, voice analytics, and storage of data about workers&#x27; family members, including children. One worker based in Bogota, who works on the Apple account, told NBC News: 
The contract allows constant monitoring of what we are doing, but also our family. I think it&#x27;s really bad. We don&#x27;t work in an office. I work in my bedroom. I don&#x27;t want to have a camera in my bedroom.

                    <span>To me, version 14 feels like the biggest major release of BBEdit in many years. For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.
For everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:
You know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled
documents open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some
notes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s
amazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose
your carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,
but we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and
easier: Notes.
Notes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you
don’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you
don’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.
Notes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format
involved. […]
There are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits
your workflow and style.
Notes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).

                    <span>Michael Buckley:
macOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.
This is the primary reason Retrobatch isn&#x27;t sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I&#x27;ve considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.
Every year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.

Philadelphia got one restricted free agent locked up.
 Even after an already hectic offseason for Philadelphia Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher, he had two more things to do and with the team electing for salary arbitration with restricted free agent defenseman Travis Sanheim, it was really just one thing left to do. And on Monday, they did it.
Announced by the team, the Flyers have re-signed goaltender Carter Hart to a three-year contract with a cap hit of $3.979-million, a nod to his No. 79 jersey.
OFFICIAL: Philly got Hart. https://t.co/1N2uUSGj8Q

This new deal is Hart’s first contract with the team since signing his entry-level deal way back in 2016, almost immediately after the Flyers drafted him…</span>

Analyzing the 10th and final season in Philadelphia for the high production Czech winger.
 Following a disappointing 2020-21 season that saw the Flyers miss out on the Stanley Cup playoffs, we knew the team was headed for change — and part of that change involved roster staple Jake Voracek. 
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher ended Voracek’s 727-game career in Orange and Black by sending the soon-to-be 32-year-old to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for winger Cam Atkinson. It’s a homecoming of sorts for Voracek, who was drafted seventh overall by the BJ’s back in 2007 before being sent to Philadelphia — along with a pick that became Sean Couturier — for Jeff Carter in 2011. 



The trade put an end to a tremendous 10-year run for Voracek and…</span>

Guts, gore, and a whole lot of dialogue
 One of the first lessons I learn in Death Trash is that I can use my own puke as a resource, so I scrape my vomit off the floor and tuck it into my inventory. That’s gonna come in handy, since these ancient machines need bio-material to operate. It’s a quick way to get accustomed to the weird world that awaits me out there.
Death Trash is an early access role-playing game by developer Crafting Legends that feels like a 2021 take on the original Fallout. I emerge from a bastion of safety and enter a hostile wasteland to scrape out a living. Along the way, I encounter small civilizations and groups of people who need help.

Have some watery fun in the wasteland
 Fallout 76 allows players to collect in-game blueprints and paid cosmetics to customize their CAMPs. It’s a wonderfully domestic way to spend time in the wasteland of Appalachia, and custom builds are a major part of the game’s community. Bethesda has expanded players’ options by adding tools for a fully fledged water park to the game, and it’s a source of both creativity and controversy.
The new water park allows players to set up some pretty impressive vacation spots that stand out against the desolate backdrop of raiders, mothmen, and abandoned settlements full of skeletons. Fans are already having fun setting up their own water parks for the summer. The water park also has synergy with some …</span>

Campaign versus mode not part of Turtle Rock’s L4D spiritual successor
 Turtle Rock Studios’ Back 4 Blood is wrapping up its early access preview on Monday — an open beta will follow on Aug. 12 — which has given players a sneak peek at the studio’s Left 4 Dead successor. As part of that early access preview, Back 4 Blood players learned something new about the co-op zombie shooter: The game won’t feature a campaign versus mode, as previous Left 4 Dead games have. 
Campaign versus was one of the multiplayer bedrocks of Left 4 Dead, so its exclusion from Back 4 Blood is surprising and, for many prospective players, disappointing. In campaign versus mode, two teams of four players (one side as the survivors, one side a…</span>

Bungie has slid its way into a new controversy 
 Bungie revealed a host of new changes coming to Destiny 2 last Thursday, and naturally, fans are pissed. But Destiny players aren’t mad that their favorite gun is getting nerfed or about the bevy of changes coming to various subclasses. No, Destiny players are mad about sliding changes. 
Sliding is a way of life in Destiny 2. While useful in PvE for moving quickly and dodging bullets, it’s most commonly seen in The Crucible, Destiny’s PvP mode. Sliding helps players move fast while lowering their profile, making it harder for enemy Guardians to track their movements. When paired with a shotgun, sliding becomes a powerful tool to surprise someone with a blast from the ground.

‘We wanted a digital comics format that actually takes advantage of being on computers so we learned how to make game’
 Internal Affairs DDCollection is more than just a digitized version of a stylish comic book. It’s chaotic and loud, and “a less practical way to read digital comics,” according to creator Peow Studio. And that’s what makes it fantastic.
Peow Studio, a Swedish comics publisher, created its own digital comics reader for its Internal Affairs series, which features an Onion intern at a shitty company. And there are mechs. Three issues of Internal Affairs are available inside the new reader, all updated with commentary, new art, and chaotic music. If you get bored of reading, there are also plenty of other things to click on. You can toggle art (on …</span>

Upgrade planned for PC, but not for PS4 or Nintendo Switch versions
 Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice has been optimized for Xbox Series X and Series S. The upgrade is free for anyone who has the game, which includes subscribers to Xbox Game Pass. 
The upgrade is only for the new Xbox consoles. Hellblade studio Ninja Theory says an update for PC “is currently in development,” but there are no plans to offer it for any other platforms. Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Windows PC. Microsoft acquired Ninja Theory in June of 2018.
The optimized Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice gives players three visual fidelity settings — performance, resolution, and enriched, with the latter offering ray tracing on both Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Enriched mode supports dynamic resolutions up to 4K on Series X, and full HS on Series S, at 30 frames per second for both consoles.
Performance mode on Series X offers dynamic resolutions to 1080p at 120 Hz frame rates; it’s full HD and 60 fps on Series S. Resolution mode on Series X prioritizes dynamic resolutions to 4K, at 60 fps; Series S gets dynamic resolution support to 1440p at 30 fps.
“Also being added: Texture resolution bump, Chapter select, increased particle quality, increased draw distance, higher levels of detail,” the game’s official website says.
Ninja Theory said QLOC, the company behind Hellblade’s port to Nintendo Switch in 2019, handled the optimized version upgrade, freeing the studio to continue working on Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. In June, the studio indicated the sequel was still early in development, likely the reason why it wasn’t shown at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase for E3 2021 that month. Senua’s Saga was announced at The Game Awards in December 2019.</span>

Microsoft promises game updates, but not much else
 Microsoft is heading (virtually) to this year’s Gamescom, the annual video game expo normally held in Germany every summer, in the form of a livestream on Aug. 24. That’s one day before Gamescom 2021 officially begins on Aug. 25. This year’s expo will be entirely digital, just like last year.
The Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream can be viewed on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and Twitter on Aug. 24 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT/7 p.m. CEST.
The Xbox team promises “in-depth updates from some of our previously announced Xbox Game Studios titles alongside some of our third-party partners,” during its Gamescom 2021 stream. Expect Microsoft to focus on games scheduled for release this holiday season, like Halo Infinite, and titles coming to Xbox Game Pass.
Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing, reemphasized on Twitter that the stream is “focused on game updates coming this year.” Greenberg said viewers shouldn’t expect new reveals or major surprises, but teased “a fun stream.” (You can probably expect those new reveals and major surprises to show up during Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stream hosted by Geoff Keighley coming on Aug. 25 at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m PDT.)</span>

In a way, it’s the purest form of the music–the words themselves, stripped of the power of recognition, rely entirely on their instrumental, musical, and emotional value rather than any preconceived notions as to what the songs themselves may be about. ...</span>

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s living room hardware strategy remains poorly defined and lacks a coherent vision, with engineers allegedly pessimistic about the product line, according to a new report.





This year the Apple TV got an iterative update with a redesigned Siri Remote, while the HomePod was discontinued. Apple is now said to be developing a combined HomePod-Apple TV device with a built-in screen and FaceTime camera.



In his latest &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, however, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman says that Apple engineers have personally expressed concerns to him about the direction of Apple&#x27;s living room hardware strategy.



Despite the obvious benefits of an ‌Apple TV‌ for users invested in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem, Gurman opines that the set-top box is largely failing in a market dominat…</span>

                    <span>With every new version of iOS, Apple makes an effort to provide new privacy and security-focused features to make the iPhone and iPad more secure, and iOS 15 is no exception. It is, in fact, a huge leap forward in privacy thanks to features like iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email.





In this guide, we&#x27;ve outlined all of the privacy and security features that are available in ‌iOS 15‌ to give MacRumors readers a clear picture of what&#x27;s new.



iCloud+


Alongside ‌iOS 15‌, Apple debuted a new ‌iCloud‌+ service, which adds additional features to all paid ‌iCloud‌ accounts, which are priced starting at $0.99 per month. Apple offers a $0.99/month ‌iCloud‌ plan that adds 50GB of storage, a $2.99/month ‌iCloud‌ plan that adds 200GB storage, and a $9.99/month ‌iCloud‌ plan that …</span>

                    <span>With the launch of three new games this morning, Apple&#x27;s $4.99 per month Apple Arcade service now offers more than 200 games for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users to play.





The milestone was first highlighted by CNET, and it comes alongside the launch of Super Leap Day, Super Stickman Golf 3+, and Monster Hunter Stories+, all of which can be downloaded and played starting today.



‌Apple Arcade‌ first launched in September 2019, so it has taken just under two years for Apple to provide customers with 200 titles to choose from.



With ‌Apple Arcade‌, all of the games are free and there are no in-app purchase options or ads. The service is priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, and with that subscription price, all members of the family can access games. Apple also offers a one-month free trial for anyone, a three-month free trial for those who purchase an Apple device, and there are also often promotions for longer trial periods.



Apple has been working with both indie developers and big name gaming companies on ‌Apple Arcade‌ titles since it launched, and in April of this year, Apple began re-releasing classic titles like Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Mini Metro, Threes, and more.



‌Apple Arcade‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.



New titles are added to ‌Apple Arcade‌ on a regular basis, and in the near future, the service will be gaining &quot;MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook,&quot; &quot;Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey+,&quot; &quot;Asphalt Airborne 8+,&quot; &quot;Baldo The Guardian Owls,&quot; &quot;Tetris Beat,&quot; and &quot;Wurdweb.&quot;

                    <span>Apple today scored a victory in an ongoing patent dispute with Personalized Media Communications (PMC), with the judge overseeing the case tossing out the $308.5 million verdict that Personalized Media Communications won in March, reports Bloomberg.





Apple was a victim of PMC&#x27;s plan to milk the tech industry for high royalties on old ideas, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said when delivering the verdict. The judge decided that PMC&#x27;s patent for digital rights management is unenforceable because the company delayed its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to get more money.



PMC filed hundreds patent applications in the 1980s and 1990s, but no patents were awarded until 2010. The company took advantage of a loophole that allowed for an indefinite application process and then a patent valid for 17 years. This was addressed in 1995, but didn&#x27;t apply to the patents used against Apple because they were filed earlier.



PMC delayed receiving its patents until after the technology in the patent had already been adopted, letting it make more money from tech companies.



Internal documentation from PMC suggested the company had thought that Apple would be a &quot;natural candidate&quot; to target with delayed patents, along with Intel, IBM, and Microsoft.



PMC won a $308.5 million verdict against Apple in March after a jury said that Apple infringed on DRM patents with its FairPlay technology that is used to distribute encrypted content through iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music.

                    <span>Apple this week announced that, starting later this year with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the company will be able to detect known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) images stored in iCloud Photos, enabling Apple to report these instances to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a non-profit organization that works in collaboration with law enforcement agencies across the United States.





The plans have sparked concerns among some security researchers and other parties that Apple could eventually be forced by governments to add non-CSAM images to the hash list for nefarious purposes, such as to suppress political activism.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Spotify this week confirmed that its plans to add AirPlay 2 support to its iOS app have been placed on indefinite hiatus.





In an online discussion forum post, a Spotify representative said the streaming music service had been working on supporting AirPlay 2, but the company has paused the efforts &quot;for now&quot; due to &quot;audio driver compatibility issues.&quot; The representative described AirPlay 2 support as a &quot;bigger project that we won&#x27;t be able to complete in the foreseeable future.&quot;



AirPlay 2 launched as part of iOS 11.4 in May 2018 with several enhancements to the original AirPlay wireless audio protocol, including multi-room audio, Siri voice control, and improved buffering. An app can support AirPlay 2 by implementing AVFoundation framework APIs, with a four-step process outlined on Apple&#x27;s developer website.



Spotify has also yet to add native support for the HomePod (or its HomePod mini successor), despite Apple opening up the speaker to third-party music services last year. This is despite Spotify filing a complaint against Apple with the European Commission in March 2019 that accused the iPhone maker of &quot;locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as Siri, HomePod, and Apple Watch.&quot; 



We&#x27;ve reached out to Spotify for comment and we&#x27;ll provide an update if we hear back.

                    <span>Apple suppliers manufacturing the iPhone 13 models are struggling to hire enough workers ahead of the expected launch of new devices in September, according to the South China Morning Post.





In an attempt to attract workers to meet demand for the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, Apple suppliers in China are significantly raising their starter bonuses. Foxconn&#x27;s factory in Zhengzhou, which is estimated to manufacture around 80 percent of the world&#x27;s iPhones, has raised its new hires bonus to a record high of 10,200 yuan (U.S. $1,578).



Likewise, Lens Technology has doubled its bonus 5,000 yuan in February to 10,000 yuan in May, while Luxshare Precision&#x27;s factory in Guangdong has doubled its internal referral bonus from 2,500 yuan in April to 5,000 yuan in May, with a top-up bonus of 3,800 yuan for returning workers who previously left the company.



Over the past three years, Apple has added more new suppliers from mainland China to its vendor list than any other country, but simultaneously the growth of China&#x27;s labor force has peaked as factory jobs have started to lose their appeal and more workers move out of industrial labor, leading to companies having to lure in workers with more attractive pay packages.



The current aggressive hiring spree seeks to combat increasingly ramped-up production for the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.

                    <span>The first physical Apple retail store in India, promised by Apple CEO Tim Cook last year to open in 2021, has been delayed due to the worldwide health crisis, the company has confirmed to The Indian Express.





Last year, during an earnings call, Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ stated that his company plans to open its first official Apple Store in India by 2021. Clearly, due to the unforeseen and unpredictable challenges presented by the global health crisis, Apple has delayed its store opening in Mumbai.



In September, Apple tailored to its strong Indian customer base by opening an online store. This gave customers a direct way to purchase products from the company itself rather than from authorized retailers. 



In the past, Cook and other Apple executives have remarked on India&#x27;s importance, including in the latest quarterly earnings call, stating that Apple had grown double-digits in India, along with a few other countries.

                    <span>Popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it is now allowing traders to use bank cards linked to Apple Pay to purchase crypto assets on the platform.




&quot;Today, we&#x27;re introducing new and seamless ways to enable crypto buys with linked debit cards to Apple Pay and Google Pay, and instant cashouts up to $100,000 per transaction available 24/7,&quot; said a Coinbase blog post on Thursday.



&quot;If you already have a Visa or Mastercard debit card linked in your Apple Wallet, Apple Pay will automatically appear as a payment method when you&#x27;re buying crypto with Coinbase on an Apple Pay-supported iOS device or Safari web browser.&quot;
In addition, Coinbase said it is also making it easier and faster for users to access their money by offering instant washouts via Real Time Payments (RTP), allowing customers in the U.S. with linked bank accounts to instantly and securely cash out up to $100,000 per transaction.



In June, Coinbase debit cards gained ‌Apple Pay‌ support, allowing it to be added to the Wallet app on iPhone. The Coinbase Card automatically converts the cryptocurrency that a user wishes to spend to U.S. dollars, and transfers the funds to their Coinbase Card for ‌Apple Pay‌ purchases and ATM withdrawals.

The dark comedy, whose season one finale airs Friday, sees Byrne take the role of Sheila, a distressed housewife in the 1980s who transforms into an aerobics video star while her husband runs for political office.




&quot;We couldn&#x27;t be more proud to showcase Annie Weisman&#x27;s singular take on this darkly funny, heartbreaking and bold story,&quot; said Michelle Lee, Director of Domestic Programming at Apple TV+. &quot;And then we got to watch Rose Byrne inhabit this incredible, multi-layered character, giving us an unforgettable tour de force performance. We have been thrilled to see audiences around the world fall in love and feel seen by this show and we can&#x27;t wait for everyone to experience the next chapter in Sheila&#x27;s journey towards personal empowerment.&quot;
&quot;Physical&quot; was created by Annie Weisman, who has worked on shows like &quot;About a Boy,&quot; &quot;Suburgatory,&quot; &quot;I Feel Bad,&quot; and &quot;Desperate Housewives.&quot; The show is directed by &quot;I, Tonya&quot; director Craig Gillepsie, as well as Liza Johnson and Stephanie Laing.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-cash-instant-transfer-mastercard/">

                    <span>Apple Cash, Apple&#x27;s peer-to-peer payments service that works with Apple Pay and iMessage, received a couple of small updates on Thursday. 





It&#x27;s now possible to use Instant Transfer with both Mastercard and Visa debit cards. Previously only the latter card could be used, so the addition of Mastercard means Instant Transfer is more accessible to users who want to quickly transfer money from an Apple Cash balance to a bank account without having to wait for the transaction to be processed.



Apple says that beginning August 26, 2021, the cost of making an Instant Transfer will change to 1.5% (previously 1%) of the transfer amount, with a minimum fee of $0.25 and a maximum fee of $15. 



If users don&#x27;t want to use Instant Transfer, they can also transfer money to their bank account using ACH and receive it within one to three business days with no fee. 



To make an Instant Transfer, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Cash card, then tap the three-dotted icon. Tap Transfer to Bank, enter an amount, and select Instant Transfer.



Currently only available in the United States, Apple Cash can be used to make and receive payments in Messages, or you can get Siri to send money to a friend or family member. 


How to Set up an Apple Cash Card on iPhone and iPad


When someone sends you money, it goes on your virtual Apple Cash card, which is stored securely in the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can use the money on it to send to someone, make purchases using ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ in stores, within apps, and on the web.

Giant Ariana Grande saves the world
 Ariana Grande has come to Fortnite as a massive, glass-ceiling-shattering god. During Friday’s Rift Tour event, players got to play along in several minigames and experience new settings, all while a virtual version of the pop star performed some of her most famous songs. 
The in-game event started by dropping players onto a massive rainbow-colored slide, where they can pick up powers to make them go faster. As players slid and started to speed up, “Come and Go” by Marshmello ft. Juice Wrld played, kicking off the concert. From there, everyone got transported to a giant stuffed bear, where they could bounce around. Next, a giant crystal monster appeared and players are transported into an airplane to shoot him down, all while …</span>

Five concert times between Friday evening and Sunday
 Ariana Grande and Fortnite team up Friday evening for the Rift Tour, an in-world concert featuring the multi-platinum Grammy winner. Her show kicks off at 6 p.m. EDT, with four encores, one on Saturday and three on Sunday. Here’s how to watch the concert:
For starters, here are the show times (all times EDT)
Friday, Aug. 6 at 6 p.m.
Saturday, Aug. 7 at 2 p.m.
Sunday, Aug. 8 at 12 a.m.
Sunday, Aug. 8 at 10 a.m.
Sunday, Aug. 8 at 6 p.m.
Of note, this FAQ says Rift Tour dates are not region-locked; Epic has selected times that are most convenient for certain parts of the globe, but tune in whenever you like. Go more than once if you want, too.

When you absolutely, positively must play every class or job in the game
 I’ve never been able to just jump into a game and just choose the play style or class that sounds the most fun. I always second-guess myself and get an itch to try something different. All class-based games present this kind of problem for me. MMOs typically require players to start over each time they want to try a different play style, adding restrictions that only further increase my analysis paralysis. But Final Fantasy 14 feels like it’s built for fiddly, indecisive players like me. 
In World of Warcraft, I’m known as an “altoholic,” a dismissive reference to a far more serious affliction. Altoholics like myself play multiple characters, sinking hours into different play styles. It’s …</span>

Overwatch League loses another sponsor
 Another sponsor has pulled its endorsement from Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League. On Friday, the Kellogg Co. confirmed that it “will not be moving forward” with OWL partnership programs this year. The move is Kellogg’s response to allegations of gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment at Overwatch publisher and developer Blizzard Entertainment.
“We find these allegations troubling and inconsistent with our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said in a statement to Polygon. “While Activision Blizzard has announced plans to address the challenging issues it faces, we will not be moving forward with any new programs this year, but will continue to review …</span>

How to easily get to Inazuma, in just six or seven mind-numbing hours
 Genshin Impact players have found a way to bust into the game’s newest location long before they’re supposed to. Players have tried fruitlessly to wiggle their way into the game’s newest region, Inazuma, by building massive ice bridges across vast stretches of open water, only to be foiled by developer Mihoyo’s explicit attempts to prevent that.
One truly dedicated player, however, discovered a method that combines clever manipulation of their internet connection with a character’s surprisingly useful ice attack.
Reddit user dezeadmf, known in-game as Meow, has made the long trek from Liyue Harbor, located near the southeastern part of Genshin Impact’s starting map, to Inazuma’s entry port, Ritou,…</span>

Get three weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Bannerfall
3 wins — Exile’s Curse, Arc fusion rifle
5 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, Warlock class item)
7 wins — Igneous Hammer, Solar hand cannon
Flawless — The Messenger (Adept), Kinetic pulse rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to Nessus for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur on Nessus, north of the Watcher&#x27;s Grave, standing on a large tree.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:
Skyburner’s Oath, Solar scout rifle: 29 Legendary Shards
Ophidia Spathe, Hunter chest: 23 Legendary Shards
Severance Enclosure, Titan chest: 23 Legendary Shards
Eye of Another World, Warlock helmet: 23 Legendary Shards

The Early Access game offers tons of tools for causing chaos
 One of my favorite parts of social sabotage games like Werewolf and Among Us is successfully fooling folks as the hidden agent. In many games, these moments are quick and brutal — a poor, unsuspecting victim finds themselves alone in a room with an impostor for just a minute, and things immediately go wrong. The creators of Dread Hunger, however, make you do things the slow way. It makes the game much tougher, tenser, and overall better.
In Dread Hunger, you set off on a 18th-century ship that breaks down in the Canadian Arctic and play as one of eight crewmates. Each has a certain role on the ship, like chaplain or cook. The characters are on a journey of discovery, but tw…</span>

                    <span>File this under Things I Definitely Want to Do Sometime: riding electric-assist railbikes through a California redwood forest. Check out how fun this looks:

From the LA Times:
To pedal the rails at Fort Bragg, you book a trip, show up at the station, settle into a vehicle, don a helmet and seat belt, pedal through four downtown intersections (train signals halt traffic) and pass a cemetery.
Then suddenly you’re in the woods, hearing only birdsong and the gentle hum of wheels on tracks. There’s no need to exert yourself pedaling: The railbikes, which weigh about 250 pounds each, are outfitted like e-bikes with quiet electric motors that can push you along at 10 mph even if you don’t pedal.

                    <span>To celebrate the 30th anniversary of their 16x platinum Black Album, Metallica is releasing an album on Sept 10th called The Metallica Blacklist, which contains Black Album covers featuring 53 different artists. One of those covers is Enter Sandman by Weezer, which you can watch above. Some of the other songs on the album include:
St. Vincent — Sad but True
All profits from the album will be donated to charity. You can listen to the songs that have already been posted on Spotify, pre-save or pre-order the album, or check out this album trailer to hear what you’re getting into:

I’ve been listening to the Black Album a little bit recently (it came out my freshman year in college and so hits me right between the eyes) so I’m looking forward to checking this out.

                    <span>Apple in May released the new M1 11 and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, and they&#x27;re the first iPads that use Apple&#x27;s M-series chips designed for Macs instead of A-series iOS chips, and the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ has an all-new mini-LED display.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


We did a hands-on video back when the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ first came out, but MacRumors videographer Dan has been using it daily since launch, and thought he&#x27;d revisit it to give an updated review on how it has fit into his workflow and with his other devices.



If you&#x27;re still on the fence about one of the ‌M1‌ iPad Pros, Dan&#x27;s video is worth watching to see how it performs in day to day usage over a period of time and whether it&#x27;s worth picking up.

One of the new features, Communication Safety, has raised privacy concerns because it allows Apple to scan images sent and received by the Messages app for sexually explicit content, but Apple has confirmed that this is an opt-in feature limited to the accounts of children and that it must be enabled by parents through the Family Sharing feature.



If a parent turns on Communication Safety for the Apple ID account of a child, Apple will scan images that are sent and received in the Messages app for nudity. If nudity is detected, the photo will be automatically blurred and the ch…</span>

                    <span>Apple today announced that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 will see the introduction of a new method for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on iPhones and iPads in the United States. 





User devices will download an unreadable database of known CSAM image hashes and will do an on-device comparison to the user&#x27;s own photos, flagging them for known CSAM material before they&#x27;re uploaded to iCloud Photos. Apple says that this is a highly accurate method for detecting CSAM and protecting children.



CSAM image scanning is not an optional feature and it happens automatically, but Apple has confirmed to MacRumors that it cannot detect known CSAM images if the ‌iCloud Photos‌ feature is turned off.



Apple&#x27;s method works by identifying a known CSAM photo on device and then flaggi…</span>

                    <span>Apple today announced that with the launch of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, it will begin scanning iCloud Photos in the U.S. to look for known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), with plans to report the findings to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).





Prior to when Apple detailed its plans, news of the CSAM initiative leaked, and security researchers have already begun expressing concerns about how Apple&#x27;s new image scanning protocol could be used in the future, as noted by Financial Times.



Apple is using a &quot;NeuralHash&quot; system to compare known CSAM images to photos on a user&#x27;s iPhone before they&#x27;re uploaded to iCloud. If there is a match, that photograph is uploaded with a cryptographic safety voucher, and at a certain threshold, a review is triggered …</span>

                    <span>Apple today previewed new child safety features that will be coming to its platforms with software updates later this year. The company said the features will be available in the U.S. only at launch and will be expanded to other regions over time. 





Communication Safety


First, the Messages app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac will be getting a new Communication Safety feature to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos. Apple said the Messages app will use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments, and if a photo is determined to be sexually explicit, the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned.



When a child attempts to view a photo flagged as sensitive in the Messages app, they will be alerte…</span>

                    <span>Apple today announced a new Apple Music for Artists feature called Shareable Milestones, which is designed to allow ‌Apple Music‌ artists to share key milestones and successes with their fans on social media.





The ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists feature generates automatic milestones for artists of all sizes, which artists can highlight on social media networks. Milestones include new highs and all-time bests across Plays and Shazams, and inclusion in ‌Apple Music‌&#x27;s curated playlists.



Artists will see images celebrating their milestones on their iOS overview page for ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists, and can tap the share icon to open up the share sheet. Users will also see relevant milestones on the song and country detail pages. Milestones can be shared to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook and Instagram stories.



Sharing milestones is a feature that&#x27;s limited to artists at the current time and the images can only be accessed through the ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists iOS app.



Though limited to ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists at the current time, this is perhaps a feature that Apple could roll out to all ‌Apple Music‌ users in the future, allowing them to share metrics that are normally only available through the year-end Apple Music Replay and Recap features.



Apple Music for Artists is available to all artists who use ‌Apple Music‌. It provides artists and their teams with sales and streaming data for songs, albums, playlists, and more.

                    <span>Over the last few weeks, an ever-increasing number of Apple users have been frustratingly sharing issues they&#x27;re experiencing with iTunes Match, Apple&#x27;s service that allows users to upload songs to iCloud from other sources, such as CDs.





iTunes Match is officially part of an Apple Music subscription and is there known as ‌iCloud‌ Music Library. iTunes Match allows users to upload songs and make them available across all of their devices. iTunes Match only uploads songs to users&#x27; cloud if it&#x27;s unavailable to find that same song within the iTunes library. iTunes Match is available outside of ‌Apple Music‌ for $24.99 a year.

                    <span>Apple has published three new support documents with further details about the Mac Pro&#x27;s new AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series MPX graphics modules, which became available earlier this week. The support documents walk through the many different display setups that can be used with the GPUs and how to use AMD&#x27;s Infinity Fabric Link technology for increased performance and faster data transfer between the modules.





One notable detail from the support documents is that the Infinity Fabric Link bridges for the new Radeon Pro W6000 series modules are not compatible with previous-generation Radeon Pro MPX modules, according to Apple.

Three new modules are available for the latest Mac Pro as built-to-order upgrade options on Apple&#x27;s online store, including the Radeon Pro W6800X, Radeon Pro W6800X Duo, and Radeon Pro W6900X. The modules can also be purchased on a standalone basis for customers who already own the latest Mac Pro, with prices ranging from $2,800 to $6,000.



Apple said the new graphics options provide up to 84% faster performance when running the Octane X rendering app and up to 23% faster performance when using the video editing and color correction app DaVinci Resolve on the Mac Pro.

                    <span>In iPadOS 15, Apple introduced a new productivity feature called Quick Notes that aims to provide a quicker way to jot down things on your iPad without you having to go in and out of the Notes app. 





Whether you&#x27;re on the Home Screen or within any app, you can bring up a floating Quick Note window at any time using your finger or an Apple Pencil, by swiping diagonally up from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. 





If you&#x27;re using a connected keyboard that has a Globe key, simply press the Globe key + Q to launch a Quick Note. You can also add a Quick Note button to Control Center: Go to Settings -&gt; Control Center, then add the Quick Note option from the &quot;Included Controls&quot; section.

                    <span>Apple has featured a number of apps with disproportionately expensive subscriptions on the App Store, arousing the ire of some developers.





The ‌App Store‌ feature on the Australian ‌App Store‌, first highlighted by Beau Nouvelle on Twitter, is called &quot;Slime relaxations&quot; and reportedly features apps that are non-functional and seek to charge disproportionately costly in-app purchase subscriptions.




Apple promoting these slime apps again.
A few of them have $10+ weekly subscriptions.
One of them doesn’t even do anything.https://t.co/d0dKLCkiVF
— Beau Nouvelle (@BeauNouvelle) August 4, 2021
 




One of the apps, called &quot;Jelly: Slime Simulator, ASMR,&quot; features a $13 per week subscription to get past its paywall, amounting to $676 per year. Apple&#x27;s App Store Review Guidelines state (with emphasis our own):
If we can&#x27;t understand how your app works or your in-app purchases aren&#x27;t immediately obvious, it will delay your review and may trigger a rejection. And while pricing is up to you, we won&#x27;t distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs. We&#x27;ll reject expensive apps that try to cheat users with irrationally high prices.




The fact that such apps have passed the ‌App Store‌ review process to be awarded a special feature from Apple on the ‌App Store‌ has induced outrage in some developers, such as Simeon Saëns of Two Lives Left, who took a closer look at one of the apps.



Given that at least some of these apps charge $13 per week, it is difficult to not see them as breaking ‌App Store‌ guidelines, so it is particularly surprising that they were actively featured by Apple on the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>Apple TV+ today released a &quot;first look&quot; featurette of &quot;Mr. Corman,&quot; a dark comedy series created by, directed by, and starring Joseph Gordon Levitt.






&quot;Mr. Corman&quot; follows the days and nights of Josh Corman (played by Gordon-Levitt), an artist at heart but not by trade. A career in music hasn&#x27;t panned out, and he teaches fifth grade at a public school in the San Fernando Valley. His ex-fiancé Megan has moved out, and his high school buddy Victor has moved in. He knows he has a lot to be thankful for, but finds himself struggling with anxiety, loneliness, and self-confidence issues.



The three-minute featurette sees the cast and crew discuss the show, and includes behind-the-scenes footage offering viewers a sense of Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s creative production process.



&quot;Darkly funny, oddly beautiful and deeply heartfelt, this relatable dramedy speaks for our contemporary generation of 30-somethings: rich with good intentions, poor with student loans, and yearning to become real grown-ups sometime before they die,&quot; said Apple, in a press release for the upcoming show.



The first two episodes of the 10-episode first season will debut on August 6, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday.

IMDb TV offers viewers free access to a range of popular shows and movies, such as &quot;Mad Men,&quot; &quot;Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; &quot;Wolf of Wall Street,&quot; and &quot;How to Train Your Dragon.&quot; It also features originals from Amazon Studios, and the company says IMDb TV has half as many ads as traditional terrestrial TV.



The Amazon-owned subsidiary originally launched the free service as Freedive in January 2019, before renaming it IMDb TV. After first rolling out to Roku, IMDb TV apps were released in March for LG smart TVs, PlayStation 4, NVIDIA Shield, and TiVo Streak 4K. The IMDb TV app is also available on Amazon&#x27;s Fire TV and as a free channel on the Prime Video app. 



The launch of iOS and Android apps completes the platform rollout, and should allow the service to expand its U.S. mobile audience. A report last year suggested the company is planning to make the free service available globally, with Mexico and the U.K. possibly becoming the first regions to gain access, with more European countries and Latin America following suit.

                    <span>Apple this week began highlighting exclusive offers that are available for Apple Card holders, with the offerings presented right in the Wallet app when accessing the ‌Apple Card‌.





As noted by Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple is offering ‌Apple Card‌ users free access to Apple News+ and unlimited coffee with any order from Panera bread.




Looks like Apple is planning some sort of “Offers” feature for the Apple Card. I just saw a free News+ offer (sponsored by Panera Bread) in my Wallet app on iOS 15 on two devices. Link to sign up is broken and the message is now gone: https://t.co/zb8EVfTYBY
— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) August 5, 2021
 


This feature is still in the process of rolling out, and tapping on the &quot;Learn More&quot; button leads to a broken link so the full terms of the ‌Apple News‌+ deal are unknown.



Apple has offered special promotions for ‌Apple Card‌ users before, usually in the form of extra cash back from select merchants or discounted prices on digital goods.



Extra cash back deals are also shown right in the ‌Apple Card‌ interface like the ‌Apple News‌+ offer, but this appears to be the first time that Apple has advertised one of its own services to ‌Apple Card‌ holders directly in the Wallet app.



It&#x27;s not unusual for credit card companies to offer discounts and deals to their customers on various products, but Apple is in the unique position of having credit card customers and services to promote to its credit card users.

                    <span>Ted Johnson, reporting for Deadline:
CNN head Jeff Zucker said that the network has fired three
employees for going into the office without being vaccinated
against Covid-19, and that parent WarnerMedia may ultimately
require proof of the shots. […]
“In the past week, we have been made aware of three employees who
were coming to the office unvaccinated,” Zucker wrote in an email
to staff. “All three have been terminated. Let me be clear — we
have a zero-tolerance policy on this. You need to be vaccinated to
come to the office. And you need to be vaccinated to work in the
field, with other employees, regardless of whether you enter an
office or not. Period. We expect that in the weeks ahead, showing
proof of vaccination may become a formal part of the WarnerMedia
Passcard process. Regardless, our expectations remain in place.”

                    <span>Juliette Kayyem, assistant secretary for homeland security under President Obama, writing for The Atlantic:
The White House has rejected a nationwide vaccine mandate—a sweeping suggestion that the Biden administration could not easily enact if it wanted to—but a no-fly list for unvaccinated adults is an obvious step that the federal government should take. It will help limit the risk of transmission at destinations where unvaccinated people travel—and, by setting norms that restrict certain privileges to vaccinated people, will also help raise the stagnant vaccination rates that are keeping both the economy and society from fully recovering.
Flying is not a right, and the case for restricting it to vaccinated people is straightforward: The federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety. And although air-filtration systems and mask requirements make transmission of the coronavirus unlikely during any given passenger flight, infected people can spread it when they leave the airport and take off their mask.

Your favorite subclass is changing on Aug. 24
 Destiny 2’s upcoming season 15 and next year’s expansion, The Witch Queen, remain a mystery to players ahead of Bungie’s big showcase stream on Aug. 24. And while Bungie is keen on teasing players leading up to the event, the studio revealed some major ability changes on Thursday. 
In addition to assistant game director Joe Blackburn’s tweets on upcoming PvP changes, the Bungie team has three major topics of change to discuss before Aug. 24: abilities, weapons, and armor. The first blog is all about ability changes coming later this month.

They follow T-Mobile in the midst of a troubled time for Blizzard
 The Overwatch League faces further turmoil, according to a new report. Coca-Cola and State Farm are re-considering their partnerships with the League in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the state of California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of widespread sexual harassment and discrimination.
As reported by the Washington Post, two of the Overwatch League’s major sponsors are “re-assessing” their relationship with the League. State Farm and Coca Cola are two of the League’s seven sponsors listed on their website, along with IBM, Xfinity, Cheez-It, Pringles, and TeamSpeak.
Brand deals are one of the ways to measure success for a competitive ecosystem like the Overwatch League. The League lost T-Mobile as a sponsor on Tuesday, and it appears as though others may soon follow.
In a statement to the Post, a representative of State Farm said that the insurance provider was “reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League” and the company has requested that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.” A spokesperson for Coca-Cola shared a similar sentiment, saying that the company is “aware of the allegations” and are working to “take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.”
J. Allen Brack, the head of Blizzard Entertainment, stepped down from his position on Tuesday, with Jen ONeal and Mike Ybarra taking his place as co-leaders. Jesse Meschuk, SVP and senior people officer at Activision-Blizzard, also reportedly left the company this week. Activision-Blizzard employees have been organizing in the face of the company’s response to the lawsuit, including 2,600 signatures on an open letter from past and present employees, and a staged a walkout at Blizzard’s California office and online.
Polygon has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment and will update this post should we receive new information.</span>

Here’s everything coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War in season 5
 Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War’s fifth season is almost among us, and it’s coming with a new roadmap so players can plan ahead. The roadmap features a wide variety of content like a new Gulag for Warzone, new maps and modes for multiplayer, new weapons, and a host of updates for Zombies.
The star of season 5 looks to be the new Double Agent mode, which gives off serious Among Us vibes. Players will need to complete their various tasks while the secretly selected, titular double agents will need to sabotage the match. The investigator player will need to put the clues together to help the rest of the operatives survive.

Multiplayer also sees the return of the Demolition game mode. Season 5 will feature five maps as part of its multiplayer update, including some players have seen before: Echelon, Slums, Showroom, Drive-In, and Zoo. 
Warzone will get some new features as well. Players can play the new Clash game mode, which features Quad squads battling it out deathmatch-style. New points of interest, including Broadcast Stations, will appear around the map as well, and the Gulag is getting a makeover. Warzone will also see two new perks with Tempered and Combat Scout.
The Zombies mode will see a major update with season 5. Players will get their hands on a grapple gun, a tank, and a new region called Collateral. Players can also check out a new game mode called Transport. The update includes a new perk, Death Perception, and a new field upgrade called Tesla Storm.
Finally, season 5 will add five new weapons: the EM2 assault rifle, the TEC-9 SMG, a new handgun called the Marshall, a cane, and a new scorestreak that comes in the shape of a flamethrower. As always, season 5 will add a variety of operators, a new battle pass, and a mid-season event. 
Season 5 starts Aug. 12.</span>

Double Agent will let you help your friends or betray them
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is getting an additional game mode for its new season. The mode is called Double Agent and it’s based on some Among Us-style deception, as shown in the trailer released on Thursday. 
Double Agent will feature 10 players, who are each assigned a random role. The most important players are the double agents, who are tasked with either eliminating their fellow players or planting and detonating bombs across the map. Most players will play as Operatives, who have to discover the double agents and keep themselves alive. Finally, there’s the Investigator, who will get special clues to help them determine the double agents and can put out Wanted Orders on players they suspect have betrayed their allies. 
The mode will feature a variety of extra features, including weapons that players can collect throughout the early stages of a match, and certain extra tools for the double agents, to help give them a leg up on their targets. The mode will also heavily use voice chat to help players identify who among them seems the most suspicious. 
Double Agent will be part of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s season 5 update, which is set to be released on Aug. 12.</span>

Golf through a literal bitcoin mine 
 If you thought watching Jeff Bezos thanking Amazon workers for making his edge-of-space trip possible was grim, wait until you hear the premise for the upcoming game Golf Club: Wasteland.
Developed by Demagog Studio, Golf Club: Wasteland takes players on an odyssey through a future where humans have been wiped off the face of the Earth, and the planet has become a golf course for the ultra-rich. 
In it, you’ll play as a rich person who now lives on Mars but has returned to Earth for a round of golf. The 2D side-scroller has you putting and driving through various scenes like abandoned factories and what looks to be a literal bitcoin mine. As you go through Golf Club: Wasteland, “You’ll piece together the fall of humanity at the hands of consumerism, Silicon Valley culture, and ecological disaster,” according to the game’s description. 
The main character does it all while wearing an orange spacesuit that protects them from the elements, since, y’know, after ecological collapse, Earth is no longer habitable to humans. 
Overall, the entire premise seems like a nightmare scenario for the majority of us, but hey! Could make for a fun game. Originally scheduled to launch in August, Golf Club: Wasteland is now coming on Sept. 3 to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.</span>

“To be able to understand [Susato] ... it is very helpful that I fully understand Japanese language and culture”
 The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles shows main characters Ryunosuke Naruhodo and Susato Mikotoba getting off at a train station in London. Rina Takasaki, the voice behind Susato in the game’s English voice track, says that she could relate to her character’s journey through that moment. “I was also a teenager when I landed in Britain for the first time, full of ambition, determination, and admiration for the foreign culture,” she recalls to me over email.
Takasaki still vividly remembers the …</span>

Co-founder Steve Gaynor has stepped down following complaints from employees
 Fullbright co-founder Steve Gaynor, known for his work on Gone Home and Tacoma, has stepped down from his role as creative lead on Open Roads following multiple allegations of mistreating Fullbright employees, particularly women.
Development on Open Roads, which was announced in December 2020 and expected to star Keri Russell (The Americans) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart), is behind schedule. Fifteen employees have left the studio since development on Open Roads began in 2019; around six staff members remain. Speaking with Polygon, 12 former employees said their departure was at least in part due to Gaynor’s behavior toward workers, specifically women on…</span>

                    <span>Black holes are the largest single objects in the universe, many times larger than even the biggest stars, and have no upper limit to their size. But practically, how big is the biggest, heaviest black hole in the universe? (A: More massive than the entire Milky Way.)
The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like planets or stars they have no physical size limit, and can literally grow endlessly. Although in reality specific things need to happen to create different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single things in the universe. So how do black holes grow and how large is the largest of them all?


Videos about space are where Kurzgesagt really shines. I’ve seen all their videos about black holes and related objects, and I always pick up something I never knew whenever a new one comes out. This time around, it was quasistars and the surprisingly small mass of supermassive black holes located at galactic centers compared to the galaxies themselves.

                    <span>In the last decade, the number of pedestrians hit by cars in the United States has increased by almost 50%, even as that rate has decreased in Europe and other wealthy nations (“thanks primarily to new street and crosswalk designs, implemented in the belief that most road deaths are avoidable”). In a review of Angie Schmitt’s 2020 book Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America for the New York Review of Books, Peter Baker explores why America is increasingly hostile to pedestrians. Part of the reason is the rise of SUVs (and one would assume, trucks) in the US:
In the 1980s SUVs were a rarity. It was only in 2015 that they started outselling sedans. In 2018 they accounted for just under half of new vehicle sales, more than any other category of car.…</span>

                    <span>The Cornell Lab of Ornithology recently added the ability to identify birds from hearing their birdsong to their Merlin Bird ID app — a “Shazam for bird songs” as Fast Company says. You just start recording with your phone and the app starts telling you the birds it’s hearing. Here’s how it works:
Automatic song ID has been a dream for decades, but analyzing sound has always been extremely difficult. The breakthrough came when researchers, including Merlin lead researcher Grant Van Horn, began treating the sounds as images and applying new and powerful image classification algorithms like the ones that power Merlin’s Photo ID feature.
“Each sound recording a user makes gets converted from a waveform to a spectrogram-a way to visualize the amplitude [volume], frequency [pitch], and duration…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple in July began providing developers with access to a beta version of the AirPods Pro firmware to test new features ahead of their release. Last Friday, Apple released a second version of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware (4A362b), but it went under the radar until today when it was shared on Reddit.





According to Apple&#x27;s developer website, the second ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware update adds support for Conversation Boost, a feature that was missing from the first beta.



Conversation Boost is an iOS 15 feature that uses the beamforming microphones in the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to boost the volume level of conversations, which is ideal for those with mild to moderate hearing challenges.



The initial ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware beta added support for FaceTime Spatial Audio and Ambient Noise Reduction, two other ‌AirPods Pro‌ features that are coming in the ‌iOS 15‌ update.



Only registered developers are able to install the ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware, and the installation process is rather complicated and requires Xcode. We have a walkthrough on installing the profile for the beta, but as with all over-the-air firmware updates, it takes some time for new software to be seeded to users.

                    <span>Apple has established a deal for the rights to &quot;Argylle,&quot; an upcoming spy thriller from Matthew Vaughn, reports Deadline. A film package is nearing completion, and Apple is expected to pay around $200 million.





&quot;Argylle&quot; is based on the upcoming spy novel of the same name from author Ellie Conway. It follows the world&#x27;s greatest spy in a globe-trotting adventure, and shooting is set to start later this year.



The upcoming film has a star-studded cast, with Henry Cavill set to star. It will also feature singer Dua Lipa along with John Cena, Bryce Dallas Howard, Samuel L. Jackson, Sam Rockwell, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, and Bryan Cranston.



Matthew Vaughn is known for directing films that include &quot;Kingsman,&quot; &quot;Kick-Ass,&quot; and &quot;Stardust.&quot; In a statement, he said he was thrilled to work with Apple.

I&#x27;m thrilled to team with Apple and bring the most compelling spy thriller I&#x27;ve ever read to the only streaming service that can create a franchise of this scale and quality for global audiences to experience.


Apple has been working to secure the rights to multiple high-profile films to attract customers to Apple TV+. The company has also inked deals for &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, &quot;Emancipation&quot; with Will Smith, &quot;Bride&quot; with Scarlet Johansson, &quot;Snow Blind&quot; with Jake Gyllenhaal, &quot;Sharper&quot; with Julianne Moore, and &quot;Kitbag&quot; with Joaquin Phoenix.

&quot;Come From Away&quot; tells the story of several thousand people who have been stranded in Gander, Newfoundland after flights into the United States were grounded after the attacks that took place on September 11, 2001.
&quot;Come From Away&quot; tells the story of 7,000 people stranded in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland after all flights into the US are grounded on September 11, 2001. As the people of Newfoundland graciously welcome the &quot;come from aways&quot; into their community in the aftermath, the passengers and locals alike process what&#x27;s happened while finding love, laughter and new hope in the unlikely and lasting bonds that they forge.
Directed by Christopher Ashley, who directed the original Broadway production, &quot;Come From Away&quot; has an ensemble cast led by members of the Broadway show.



Apple says the live performance of &quot;Come From Away&quot; was filmed in May at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in New York City for an audience of 9/11 survivors and front-line workers.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook has fallen to eighth place on a list of the highest-paid CEOs and executives in the United States last year despite earning more than the previous year, according to Bloomberg.





Cook was paid $265 million in 2020, mainly comprising stock awards and a bonus as in previous years, making him the eighth highest-paid executive in the United States. Last year, Cook was paid compensation of $133.7 million, but ranked second after Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was paid $595.3 million.



Cook has overseen Apple&#x27;s rise to become the most profitable company in the world this year with revenue of $274.515 billion and profit of $57.411 billion, according to the Fortune Global 500 rankings.



In 2020, Cook was surpassed in terms of pay by the COO of Oak Street Health, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, the CEO of Opendoor Technologies, and the Co-CEOs of GoodRX Holdings. Elon Musk again overwhelmingly topped the list with compensation amounting to $6.658 billion.



Last month, it was alleged that Musk demanded to become the CEO of Apple as part of early discussions around a potential Apple acquisition of Tesla, though Musk denies this.



Apple&#x27;s Senior Vice President of Retail and People Deirdre O&#x27;Brien and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams also made the list in 93rd and 96th place, with pay of $45 million each. This makes O&#x27;Brien and Adams the fourth and fifth-highest paid women executives in the United States.

The camera hardware inside iPhones plays a significant role in the quality of photos that users can take with their devices, but another factor affecting image quality is the ‌iPhone‌&#x27;s on-device processing done by the Image Signal Processor, or ISP.

Oppo unveiled its first go at under-screen camera tech back in June 2019, and this is its third attempt at refining the system. According to the Chinese phone maker, the new version allows for a selfie camera to be placed under the display &quot;without compromising the integrity of the screen.&quot;



In previous iterations, Oppo improved the camera quality at the expense of the display, by reducing the pixel density in the area of the screen that covers the camera…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/zoom-pay-85m-users-misleading-encryption-claims/">

                    <span>As part of a class action lawsuit settlement, Zoom says it will pay $85 million to users for misleading them about offering end-to-end encryption on its videoconferencing service.





According to ArsTechnica, the company was accused of lying about its encryption description on its website and in a security white paper, as well as providing user data to Facebook and Google without users&#x27; permission.



Filed at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the proposed settlement will give Zoom users around $15 or $25 each, depending on whether they had a free or paid subscription between March 30, 2016 and July 30, 2021. Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.



In addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, &quot;designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data,&quot; according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs&#x27; motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.



In April 2020, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by The Intercept revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.



TLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. 



For Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys. But that level of security was not what the service offered at the time.

                    <span>Apple is tapping more Chinese suppliers as it seeks to meet ambitious targets for iPhone 13 production, according to a new report by Nikkei Asia. 





Apple is set to produce between 90 million and 95 million iPhones through January, according to a previous Nikkei report, and China&#x27;s Luxshare Precision Industry has won 3% of orders away from Taiwanese rivals Foxconn and Pegatron.

Luxshare will start building the iPhone 13 Pro -- as the premium model is expected to be called -- this month, according to sources, a major breakthrough for a company that has never produced iPhones on its own. Newcomers to the Apple supply chain normally start out making older iPhone models. Two companies that Luxshare acquired last year, South Korean camera module maker Cowell and metal frame maker Ca…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile is planning to shut down Sprint&#x27;s LTE network on June 30, 2022, T-Mobile confirmed to Light Reading. The shuttering of Sprint&#x27;s LTE network is part of an effort to merge the two networks following T-Mobile&#x27;s purchase of Sprint.





T-Mobile is building a 5G network that uses Sprint spectrum and towers, and it is aiming to shift Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network instead of the Sprint network.



In addition to shutting down the Sprint LTE network, T-Mobile plans to deactivate Sprint&#x27;s 3G CDMA network on January 1, 2022.
To ensure all customers can enjoy a more advanced 4G and 5G network, we will be retiring older network technologies to free up resources and spectrum that will help us strengthen our entire network, move all customers to more advanced technologies and bridge the Digital Divide. An additional part of this effort involves moving Sprint&#x27;s LTE spectrum to the T-Mobile network.
At the current time, T-Mobile has transitioned approximately 33 percent of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network. Before Sprint&#x27;s LTE network is shuttered, customers will need to transition to T-Mobile by replacing their Sprint SIMs with a T-Mobile SIM and ensuring that Voice over LTE is enabled in the device settings for voice calls on applicable devices.



T-Mobile says that most Sprint LTE and 5G devices are compatible with T-Mobile&#x27;s LTE and 5G networks.

                    <span>Following a short downtime, Apple has updated its Apple.com website to add a dedicated &quot;Store&quot; section, which has a new look.





There&#x27;s a new &quot;Store&quot; tab in the top navigation bar on the website, which goes to a dedicated online store portal where customers can select from a product carousel with cards that include Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and more. 



The design is similar to the design of the Apple Store app, and the main store page also features current deals and promotions, along with accessories and products that Apple is highlighting. Navigation is done through horizontal scrolling, which feels more natural on iOS devices than on the desktop.





Clicking into a product category like Mac presents all of the different options, along with access to comparisons and shopping specialists, accessories, and other information. 





Choosing to &quot;Buy&quot; a product through the store interface goes to the standard purchase pages that can also be accessed through any of the standard Mac, ‌iPad‌, ‌iPhone‌, or Watch categories.  



The Apple online store previously had a store tab, but it was removed in an earlier redesign. The return of the tab will make it easier for customers to get to the product they want to purchase without having to navigate through the various product pages for each device to find the &quot;Buy&quot; button.

*The Flyers will look different when they hit the ice at the start of the season. Different and, probably, better. [Inquirer]

*Good news for us as fellow Metro dwellers: the Capitals window is probably rapidly shrinking. [ProHockeyTalk]

Assistant game director Joe Blackburn revealed a Trials of Osiris revamp and the potential return of Rift
 Destiny 2’s PvP community has been up in arms for months. Between rampant cheating in the pinnacle Trials of Osiris game mode and their frustration at a lack of new maps, players focused on the Crucible have felt ignored for quite some time. But ahead of Bungie’s Destiny 2 showcase on Aug. 24 — which will show off season 15 and next year’s Witch Queen expansion — assistant game director Joe Blackburn took to Twitter to announce some planned PvP improvements. 
First, Blackburn revealed that Trials of Osiris is getting a revamp in season 15, which starts later this month. He didn’t go into detail on what this revamp will improve, but promised players will get more…</span>

Free update for PC players; launching Aug. 12 on Switch and Xbox Game Pass, too
 Art of Rally, the gorgeous, chill, and, most importantly, fun racing game that launched on PC last fall, will join the Xbox Game Pass library on Aug. 12, and launch for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on the same day.
That’s not all; developer Funselektor has a new content update planned for the game the same day, taking racers to Kenya, the game’s sixth locale (joining Finland, Norway, Japan, Germany, and the Italian island of Sardinia). This update will roll out free to those who already own Art of Rally on PC, and be included in the new console versions at their launch on Aug. 12.
Funselektor said back in May that it expects a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5 release this summer also, but it does not yet have a launch date to share.
The Kenya Update adds four new cars, two new songs, six more stages with locations referencing Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, a free-roaming map set in the Kenya environment, and even local wildlife. Zebras, giraffes, and elephants will highlight the wide-open savanna.
Art of Rally launched Sept. 23, 2020 on Windows PC and MacOs via Steam. It’s a semi-top down (mostly isometric, though the camera can be changed) approach to rally/road racing, and Funselektor has created an homage to the great FIA competition groups of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including the gloriously reckless Group B of 1982 to 1987. Art of Rally’s cars are all fictitious, but they’re very well done homages to the recognizable chassis of their times. (My favorite is the German-engineered Das Whip.)</span>

World colonization will be pushed back to a later date
 Amazon Game Studios has delayed its upcoming MMO, New World, to fall 2021. The game was previously scheduled to launch at the end of August, but the new release date is Sept. 28, 2021. 
This is the most recent of multiple delays for the game. “We know that this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer,” the developers said. “But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.” The team cited feedback from the closed beta as a factor in pushing back the game. 
You can read the full statement on New World’s Twitter page here.

— New World (@playnewworld) August 4, 2021



The aforementioned delays started in April, where the studio cited problems created by the coronavirus lockdowns. In July 2020, the studio announced that the game would be delayed to spring 2021. Then, in February 2021, the studio delayed it once more to August, 2021. The original target date was May, 2020. 
New World is an MMO where you’re tasked with colonizing a fictional landmass in the Atlantic. The game features 50-on-50 fights where entire groups clash to take the land. Amazon previously hosted a preview event with thousands of players to gather feedback. Then, it became a chaotic attempt to simulate mid-1600s war. 
New World is one of three PC games announced by Amazon Game Studios at TwitchCon 2016. However, delays and cancellations have impacted all three titles. Their multiplayer brawler Breakaway was canceled during development. Their other title, Crucible launched in May 2020, only for the studio to un-release the game and bring it back into a closed beta. The team later ceased development of Crucible in October.</span>

 Capcom revealed Street Fighter 5’s final character, the roster’s 45th fighter, on Tuesday: It’s Luke, a brand-new fighter “that specializes in moving fast and hitting hard.” More importantly, Luke’s reveal was pitched by Capcom as a peek at the future of the Street Fighter series, so don’t be surprised when he shows up as a central character in Street Fighter 6.
Gameplay featuring Luke delivering a savage beatdown of Ryu was released on Tuesday, but we don’t know much about Luke’s background or his full move set. Capcom promises to reveal more details about Luke before his release in November.
Two other fighters are coming to Street Fighter 5 sooner: Oro from Street Fighter 3 and Akira Kazama from Capcom’s Rival Schools series will be released as paid DLC on Aug. 16. You can get an in-depth look at those new DLC fighters in Capcom’s Street Fighter 5 summer update video below.


Those three DLC characters are included in Street Fighter 5’s season 5 pass, and each one can be purchased separately for MSRP $5.99 or 100,000 Fight Money, SF5’s earnable in-game currency.
Luke “will help expand the world of Street Fighter and provide fans with a glimpse into the future,” Capcom teased in a news release. That’s likely a reference to the next Street Fighter, which is reportedly due sometime in 2022, based on details leaked from a ransomware attack on Capcom in 2020. That leak outed references to Street Fighter 6 arriving in the third quarter of 2022, followed by Super Street Fighter 6 and Ultra Street Fighter 6 in the years following. Capcom has not officially announced any of those projects, and plans may have changed since then.
The latest version of Capcom’s flagship fighting game series, Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.</span>

Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania arrives Oct. 5 
 Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, the latest entry in Sega’s white-knuckle banana-grabbing platform game series, will include a variety of cameos, including Beat from the Jet Set Radio franchise.
Sega said Wednesday that Beat is just one of “several iconic guest characters” coming to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, and teased more reveals in the weeks to come. Beat is the cover star of the original Jet Set Radio and its sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, the stylish inline skating/graffiti games released for Sega Dreamcast and the original Xbox.
Jet Set Radio’s Beat will be a free, unlockable character, obtained through normal gameplay on all platforms, Sega said in a news release. In a nice little touch, when playing as Beat, the in-game bananas will change to yellow cans of spray paint.
Beat joins a familiar list of simians returning in Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania: AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, YanYan, and Doctor. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a modern, high-definition remake of the original three Super Monkey Ball games. It’s coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X on Oct. 5. The console versions will costs $39.99, while the PC version costs $29.99.</span>

                    <span>For his Faces of Century project, photographer Jan Langer made portraits of Czech people who are 100+ years old that mimic the style of photos of those same people 70 or 80 years before. If you click on the ⓘ below each pair of photographs, you can read a short biography of each person. All of these folks lived through two world wars, the Cold War, the space age, the computer age, and so much more. Incredible. (via life is so beautiful)

                    <span>I was 16 years old on the day the Berlin Wall fell. I remember coming home from school that day and watching the events unfold on television, completely shocked at how quickly it had all happened. Politics &amp; protests had been pushing the Eastern Bloc countries toward more openness for years, but before watching this video, I’d never heard that the catalyst for that world-changing event was a short mistaken statement at the end of an otherwise boring press conference. From the BBC:
East German leaders had tried to calm mounting protests by loosening the borders, making travel easier for East Germans. They had not intended to open the border up completely.
The changes were meant to be fairly minor — but the way they were delivered had major consequences.
Notes about the new rules were handed to a spokesman, Günter Schabowski — who had no time to read them before his regular press conference. When he read the note aloud for the first time, reporters were stunned.
“Private travel outside the country can now be applied for without prerequisites,” he said. Surprised journalists clamoured for more details.
Shuffling through his notes, Mr Schabowski said that as far as he was aware, it was effective immediately.
In fact it had been planned to start the next day, with details on applying for a visa.
But the news was all over television — and East Germans flocked to the border in huge numbers.


How did the Berlin Wall fall? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.

                    <span>In this video, Tomorrow’s Build takes a look at the $7 billion flood defense system that was built to protect Venice, Italy from increased flooding due to climate change. They detail how the system was built, how well it works, how it compares with other defense systems, the challenges associated with keeping it working, and how well this sort of defense system might work for other coastal cities (NYC, SF, Sydney).

                    <span>Here’s the thing about humans: they will danceify every possible activity — and canoeing is no exception.
American Freestyle canoeing is the art of paddling a canoe on flat water with perfect control of its movements. The canoe is usually leaned over to the side to help the boat turn sharply and efficiently and paddle strokes are taken on either side of the canoe depending on the individual move. Balance, paddle placement and turn initiation are a few keys to this control. Since the movements seem dance-like, some practice this art timed to music, which is the ultimate in control.


The vest &amp; bow tie, the choice of music (The Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh), his control of the canoe — it’s all perfect.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s online Apple Store is down at the current time, and attempting to access it to make a purchase gives the standard &quot;Be Right Back&quot; message. 





Given that it&#x27;s a Tuesday night/afternoon in the United States and we&#x27;re not expecting any new products this week, it&#x27;s likely that this is a temporary maintenance outage that is not related to a new product release. The Apple Store app is also down at the current time. 



We&#x27;ll update this article when the online Apple Store is back up and functional, and we&#x27;ll let MacRumors readers know if there are any notable changes. 



Update: The online Apple Store is back up. Apple has re-added a &quot;Store&quot; tab to its main site, but that appears to be the only change, suggesting the outage was mostly a behind-the-scenes maintenance update.

                    <span>OtterBox today expanded on its gaming accessory offerings with the launch of the Mobile Gaming Clip for MagSafe, which is designed to work with the iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max.





Priced at $40, the Mobile Gaming Clip attaches to an Xbox controller using a fitted clip and holds an iPhone with the magnetic mount. It can be used when playing an ‌iPhone‌ game with an Xbox controller, and OtterBox says the magnetic mount and clip design will not interfere with Xbox controller functionality.



The Mobile Gaming Clip allows for one-handed angle and tilt adjustment for a more comfortable gaming experience, and according to OtterBox, the design offers optimal controller balance to cut down on wrist stress. The magnetic mount offers &quot;strong magnetic alignment and attachment&quot; to keep the ‌iPhone‌ in place during gameplay.



The clip is able to detach from the base to serve as a table top stand, and when not in use, it folds flat for easier storage and transportation.



The Mobile Gaming Clip for MagSafe can be purchased from the OtterBox website for $39.95. It is compatible with the Xbox Series X/S Controller, the Xbox One Controller, and the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Brendan Fraser, known for movies like &quot;The Mummy,&quot; &quot;Encino Man,&quot; and &quot;No Sudden Move,&quot; has signed up to take on a role in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon,&quot; reports Deadline.





Set in 1920s Oklahoma, &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; depicts the serial murder of members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation in a string of brutal crimes known as the Reign of Terror.



The film is set to star Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, and more, with a full list of the cast available on the Apple TV+ press page for the movie. Fraser will play lawyer W.S. Hamilton, a character in the book the movie is based on.



There is no set release date for &quot;Flowers of the Killer Moon&quot; at this time, but production began in February 2021 and is set to last for several months. The movie is being filmed in the Osage and Washington counties in Oklahoma.



&quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; will be one of the most high-profile films available on Apple TV+ when it launches, and it will join existing movies like &quot;Greyhound&quot; with Tom Hanks, &quot;Cherry&quot; with Tom Holland, and &quot;Palmer&quot; with Justin Timberlake.



Apple is working on a slew of movies to boost the content available on its streaming television platform. Upcoming movies include &quot;Emancipation&quot; with Will Smith, &quot;Bride&quot; with Scarlet Johansson, &quot;Snow Blind&quot; with Jake Gyllenhaal, and &quot;Sharper&quot; with Julianne Moore.



‌Apple TV+‌ is priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple offers a 7-day free trial for everyone and a longer three month trial period for those who purchase a new Apple device. There are also various promotions for free ‌Apple TV+‌ access. Sony, for example, offers a six month Apple TV+ trial for those who have purchased a PlayStation 5.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today previewed two new games that will be released exclusively on its subscription-based gaming service Apple Arcade.



Listed as coming soon in Apple Arcade, the new titles include &quot;MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook&quot; from Tilting Point and &quot;Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey+&quot; from Level-5. No specific release dates have been announced for either game at this time.





&quot;MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook&quot; is an all-new game that will challenge players to prepare and serve food dishes in a fast-paced cooking competition inspired by the world-renowned TV show. Players will attempt to showcase their cooking abilities to become the number one chef as they are matched with other players around the world, according to Apple.



The game will also be updated with weekly in-app events based on specific themes and seasons such as Gourmet Burger Show and Spooky Show.





&quot;Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey&quot; is an existing game on the App Store that is now becoming available to Apple Arcade subscribers. Players will join Katrielle Layton in the heart of London as she becomes embroiled in a quizzical quest to search for her missing father, Professor Hershel Layton. Kat&#x27;s bicycle-based journey will have players experiencing London&#x27;s famous landmarks, from the Houses of Parliament to Tower Bridge.



Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob: Patty Pursuit&quot; has also received an update on Apple Arcade with a new competitive daily mode inside of Plankton&#x27;s Chum Bucket lab.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/mac-pro-w6000-graphics-modules/">

                    <span>Apple today began offering new high-end AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series graphics options for brand new Mac Pro configurations, and now the graphics modules are available for purchase on a standalone basis for customers who already own the computer.





Three new MPX modules are available for the latest Mac Pro, including the Radeon Pro W6800X for $2,800, the Radeon Pro W6800X Duo for $5,000, and the Radeon Pro W6900X for $6,000. Apple says customers can install up to two of the modules in a Mac Pro using Infinity Fabric Link technology for enhanced multi-GPU performance in applications like Final Cut Pro.



Announced in June, AMD said the Radeon Pro W6800 graphics module delivers up to 79% faster graphics performance than the previous-generation Radeon Pro W5700, although this was based on a test system powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X processor rather than an Intel processor. The W6800 also features 32GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory.



The current Intel-based Mac Pro was released in December 2019 in both tower and rack versions. Apple is reportedly working on a new Mac Pro powered by an Apple silicon chip with up to 32 high-performance cores and up to 128-core graphics.

                    <span>Apple today told developers that it is updating App Store pricing in some countries due to taxes and changes in foreign exchange rates.





Over the course of the next few days, app and in-app purchase pricing is set to decrease in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and all territories that use the Euro currency. Pricing of auto-renewable subscriptions will not change.



Apple is increasing prices in Georgia and Tajikistan due to new value-added taxes of 18 percent, and there will be an increase in proceeds developers collect in Italy due to a change with the Digital Services Tax effective rate.



Apple says that once the changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps for developers will be updated. Developers can change the price of apps and in-app purchases in ‌App Store‌ Connect at any time.

                    <span>One of the new App Store features coming in iOS 15 is something called ‌App Store‌ events, which will see Apple highlighting timely events within apps and games.





Apple is now experimenting with ‌App Store‌ events on ‌iOS 15‌ devices, and in the Today view of the ‌App Store‌ on iPhone, users can now see a notice about a TikTok Summer Camp event that&#x27;s set to take place today. The event is also being shown on iPadOS 15, as noted by 9to5Mac.



Listed as a card in the Today view, the first ‌App Store‌ event has a label with the time that it takes place and a link to download TikTok, which is the app that has the event going on. Tapping into it provides more information on just what the event is, and in this case, it is a Summer Camp session where creators and artists can share their expertise with fans.



According to Apple, ‌App Store‌ events will be used to tell customers about game competitions, new movie premieres, livestreams, and more. Events will be shown in the Today view, but can also be found in the Games and Apps tabs, in search results, and on the app product page.





‌App Store‌ events are limited to ‌iOS 15‌ devices, so the TikTok Summer Camp event does not show up on devices running iOS 14.7.1. Events will pick up as the launch of ‌iOS 15‌ approaches, and everyone will have access when ‌iOS 15‌ sees a public release.



Other new app-related features in ‌iOS 15‌ include an ‌App Store‌ widget that lets you see stories, collections, and events in the Today View or the Home Screen, and a privacy-focused feature that tells you which apps have accessed your location, camera, microphone, and contacts during the last seven days.

                    <span>Apple today shared the trailer for the second season of anthology drama series &quot;Truth Be Told,&quot; starring Octavia Spencer and Kate Hudson. The first episode premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday, August 20, with additional episodes to follow every Friday.






&quot;Truth Be Told&quot; descends into the world of true crime podcasts. In season two, Spencer reprises her role as podcaster Poppy Parnell as she dives into a new case that involves her childhood friend, media mogul Micah Keith, played by Hudson. As developments unfold in the case, their lifelong friendship is put to the ultimate test.



Based on the novel by Kathleen Barber, Apple says &quot;Truth Be Told&quot; provides a &quot;unique glimpse into America&#x27;s obsession with true crime podcasts&quot; and &quot;challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage.&quot;



Apple TV+ is Apple&#x27;s subscription-based service for original TV shows and films, with pricing set at $4.99 per month after a seven-day free trial or a lengthier trial with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple device. Apple TV+ is available through the Apple TV app on devices like the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, newer PlayStation and Xbox consoles, select streaming players from Roku, Amazon, and Google, and more.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Nomad today announced the launch of the MagSafe Mount Stand, a new MagSafe charging accessory that&#x27;s designed to integrate with Apple&#x27;s ‌MagSafe‌ Charger.





Like Nomad&#x27;s prior MagSafe Mount accessory, the ‌MagSafe‌ Stand is a holder for the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger rather than a standalone charging option. It is an upright stand with a cutout for the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and a space to route the cord behind it.



The ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand is made from a dark gray aluminum material, and it is heavy enough to keep the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger well secured on a desk. An iPhone 12 used with the ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand can be oriented upright in either portrait or landscape mode, and the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger is held in place with microsuction.





Apple&#x27;s ‌MagSafe‌ Charger is able to charge the ‌iPhone 12‌ models at 15W (though the iPhone 12 mini is limited to 12W) so long as the proper 20W+ power adapter is supplied. You will need to supply your own ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and power adapter with the ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand.



The ‌MagSafe‌ Mount Stand can be purchased from the Nomad website for $59.95.

                    <span>Google today announced new updates that are coming to the Google Maps app designed for the iPhone. The most notable new feature is dark mode, which Google Maps app users have long been wanting. Dark mode is an alternative to light mode and allows for a darker user interface to match other dark mode apps on iOS devices.





According to Google, dark mode is going to be rolling out &quot;in the coming weeks,&quot; and once available to you, it can be enabled in the Settings section of Google Maps. Google says that dark mode in Google Maps will save battery and &quot;give eyes a break.&quot;



Apple first introduced the Dark Mode feature with iOS 13, but it has taken Google some time to bring support to its apps. Google earlier this year began rolling out a true dark mode feature to Android users, and the iOS version of dark mode for Google Maps looks similar to the Android version.



Along with dark mode, Google today announced the launch of new Messages integration. With this feature, Google Maps users can share their real-time location with friends in an iMessage using the Google Maps button in the Messages app. Location is shared for one hour by default, but there is an option to extend access by up to three days or stop access at any time.





Google&#x27;s blog post also highlights the recently introduced widgets feature, which allows ‌iPhone‌ users to add a Google Maps widget to the Home Screen or the Today View. Widgets can be used to check traffic conditions or find nearby places.





The Google Maps app can be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Delta Air Lines will upgrade all of its pilots to the cellular M1 iPad Pro, AT&amp;T has today announced.





Following the announcement that all Delta flight attendants would receive an iPhone 12 in April, the airline has now said that all pilots will be given an ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ as part of their pilot electronic flight bags (EFB).



The ‌iPad Pro‌ will be used for a range of pre-flight management tasks and processes, where flight data and aircraft load information will be delivered directly to each pilot&#x27;s EFB, which use custom-built apps. 5G connectivity, supplied by AT&amp;T, will also be essential to how pilots use the device.



iPad Pro is extremely versatile in aviation, with its thin and light design, and bright, immersive display. The powerful new iPad Pro with 5G features the breakthrough Apple-designed M1 chip for a massive leap in performance, an all-new 12MP Ultra-Wide front camera, and advanced Liquid Retina display technologies with ultralow reflectivity for an unmatched viewing experience on the ground and in the air.




Delta follows JetBlue, which started rolling out the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ to pilots last month, but the airline has been equipping its staff with iPhones and iPads since it dropped Windows devices in 2017.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s fleet of self-driving vehicles roaming the streets of California for testing now includes 69 vehicles and 92 drivers, according to information from the California Department of Motor Vehicles obtained by macReports.





This means that Apple has added one self-driving car and 16 drivers since May this year. Apple has been expanding its autonomous vehicle test since it was granted a permit from the California DMV in April 2017, enabling it to test its self-driving technology on public roads in the state. Beginning in early 2018, multiple sources reported on the number of vehicles in Apple&#x27;s fleet, which steadily expanded throughout that year.

                    <span>Apple today announced that for this coming school year, mobile student IDs in the Wallet app will be expanding to Auburn University, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, New Mexico State University, and many more colleges across the United States.





Mobile student IDs in the Wallet app will also be expanding to Canada this year, starting with the University of New Brunswick and Sheridan College.



&quot;We&#x27;re excited to work with more schools in the US and introduce mobile student IDs in Canada to provide a secure and convenient way to get around campus with iPhone and Apple Watch,&quot; said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay. &quot;Students and faculty have embraced using their iPhone and Apple Watch as the best way to access buildings, purchase meals, and more.&quot;



Many colleges and universities already support student IDs in the Wallet app in the United States. At participating institutions, students can simply hold their ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch near a reader anywhere physical student ID cards are accepted — on and off campus. An optional Express Mode bypasses the need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, allowing for the quickest entry possible to buildings.

                    <span>Apple is researching ways to hide the iPhone&#x27;s notch when it is not in use and expand the display, according to a newly granted patent.





The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled &quot;Electronic devices with adjustable display windows&quot; and was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It explains how a device&#x27;s display could move as to show and hide the front-facing camera and other optical components.



Apple describes this mechanism as creating a &quot;window region&quot; in the display, through which a camera or other TrueDepth array components, such as a dot projector for Face ID, can work. Then, when these parts are not in use, the display would move back over the window region to hide the sensors underneath it. The summary of the patent reads:

Transit information has been available in Belgium since November of 2018; however, real-time data is new. With real-time information, users can now more easily plan their commutes based on actual transit run-times rather than simply what&#x27;s scheduled.

                    <span>Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:
Tensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.
Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.
Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone.
“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google really means it this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.

                    <span>Mark Scott and Tina Nguyen, reporting for Politico:
Just weeks after its launch, the pro-Trump social network GETTR is inundated with terrorist propaganda spread by supporters of Islamic State, according to a POLITICO review of online activity on the fledgling platform.
The social network — started a month ago by members of former President Donald Trump’s inner circle — features reams of jihadi-related material, including graphic videos of beheadings, viral memes that promote violence against the West and even memes of a militant executing Trump in an orange jumpsuit similar to those used in Guantanamo Bay.

                    <span>We all want to build great software — as quickly as possible. Here are three blockers we often hear from developers:
Getting everyone aligned
Get ideas across clearly with a clear problem statement and requirements. Use a tool like Tara to get sign-off before you start.


Visibility into actual progress
Code changes are the best indicators of progress. Use tools that enable transparency. With Tara, everyone can see commits, blocks, and merges for a sense of true progress.


Manual status updates
Manual updates are the achilles heel of every project. Use tools that automate tedious, low-value actions — like Tara’s auto-status that marks tasks as done when a PR merges.



One workspace for your team’s docs, sprints, and tasks synced to code. Plus an API for custom workflows. Get started on Tara for free.

 *The Flyers have decided to take Travis Sanheim to arbitration. That’s fun. 
Fiala &amp; Sanheim (PHI) are only club-elected salary arbitrations
— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) August 2, 2021



*Anyhoo, the oft-overlooked former captain of the Flyers, Jason Smith, is BACK with the organization! You love to see it. Guys always come back. [LV Phantoms]
*Speaking of former Flyers, are you worried about how Carsen Twarynski is feeling out in Seattle? No? Me neither but Sam wrong an article about it anyway. [Inquirer]
*We gave Chuck’s offseason moves thus far some grades. All very fair. Wide range. Lots of opinions. [BSH]
*Meltzer takes stock of the team’s veteran presence, which is pretty sizeable at this point. [Flyers]
*Have you been thinking about placing a bet on the Flyers for next season? Well the odds are, as is the Flyers’ way, right about middle of the pack. [The Athletic]
*And finally, sure you want Jack Eichel. We’d all like a Jack Eichel. But can you afford to get Jack Eichel? [ProHockeyTalk]</span>

The two will join Chun-Li and Ryu in the battle royale 
 Fortnite is getting two more characters from Street Fighter. Guile and Cammy are coming to Fortnite as unique outfits that players can buy from the in-game store, Epic Games announced Tuesday.
Guile will come with his signature costume as well as an alternate outfit that puts him in a black tank top and shorts. He’ll also get an emote and K.O. back bling. Meanwhile, Cammy comes with her classic costume and an alternate called Tactical Cammy. Cammy will also have a Borealis Backer back bling, and an emote. Buying the bundle with both characters will also unlock a loading screen with them teaming up for a fight, as well as some harvesting tools, and a jet glider.


This is the second Street Fighter duo to make their way to Epic’s battle royale game after Chun-Li and Ryu were released earlier this year. The new skins come after Epic released a teaser earlier on Tuesday, which featured a variety of Street Fighter characters on a character-select screen. The characters were on a giant map of the world with the Fortnite boss appearing to cross from the United States to the U.S.S.R., though apparently that didn’t matter much since Cammy is from the United Kingdom. 
Both skins will be released on Aug. 7, and will be available in the Fortnite in-game item shop.</span>

The trailer also shows off some potential new additions for season 5
 Stitch’s plan is almost complete in the new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s newest season. We know that Stitch is working to achieve Perseus’ goal of a Great Russia, and after he destroyed the military base on Yamantau, it seems the next step in his convoluted plan involves a mind-control broadcast. Along with the new trailer, Treyarch also announced on Tuesday that season 5 will begin on Aug. 12. 
The new trailer features a few teases of the season to come, including a likely new Operator wearing an eye patch and uploading Stitch’s broadcast signal. The signal finishes uploading just as a squad of soldiers, led by Woods, arrives to stop the mysterious new character. But they’re moments too late, and the broadcast signal turns the soldiers against each other and Woods, starting a massive brawl.
During the chaos of the fight, it’s possible to pick out a few potential new weapons for the season, including TEC-9s, which seem like a perfect new pistol, and possibly a new rifle. On top of that, it’s even possible that this new broadcast signal could be teasing some kind of mind-control Killstreak, but we’ll have to wait for more information to find out. 
With season 5 on the way soon, Treyarch and Raven Software will probably tease new features over the next several days before everything is revealed early next week.</span>

Steal a diamond and shake down saloons
 Red Dead Online’s Blood Money update is still fresh, but Rockstar is adding a few more missions for cowboys to explore. Blood Money introduced a new mission type called Opportunities, and a new one of these is on the way.
Players will get to chase down a precious yellow diamond, called Il Sovrano, which is currently in Rhodes. A group of “monied elite are meeting,” which makes this an excellent opportunity for a robbery. It’s up to you whether you go in nice and sneaky-like, or just pull out a shotgun and do things dirty. This Opportunity can be repeated on higher difficulties; completing it on Ruthless difficulty allows you to purchase a Duplessis Top Hat from Collector guide Madam Nazar.
There are also three new missions under a Saloons Contract. These require players to go to the local bars in Saint Denis and politely request some money. These missions can be acquired from open world contacts, and sometimes they can go peacefully, but other times cowboys might need to apply a little bit of violence.
Finally, a new game mode will launch on Aug. 10 called Call to Arms, in which players protect local townsfolk by fighting off waves of enemies. It will launch alongside a smaller season pass, the Quick Draw Pass, which grants players rewards as they level up.</span>

New game from Soda Drinker Pro creator
 First, there was the ultimate soda drinking experience, Soda Drinker Pro. Now, creator Will Brierly has a new concept: Beach volleyball, but with naked old men. It’s Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League, created in collaboration with illustrator Rachel Olson and Aaron Bleyaert, the host of Conan O’Brien’s Clueless Gamer series.
Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is, essentially, what is says on the tin. You’ll play as Len, an older gentleman enrolled in a nude beach volleyball league specifically for older gentlemen. The game is, largely speaking, volleyball, played with a nude ref who sometimes makes bad calls. There’s a story underneath it all, though, told through dialogue that continues throughout the game. 
Brierly said he hopes it makes players want to hug their grandparents or anyone else they love. At the very least, the game has a very catchy song.
Retired Men’s Nude Beach Volleyball League is available Tuesday as a bonus game in Humble Choice, the monthly games service from Humble Bundle. Humble Choice gives subscribers 12 PC games every month for $9. On Friday, it’ll be added to Humble Trove — the library of games available to Humble Choice subscribers.</span>

Master Chief? You mind telling me what you’re doing on Waze?
 Driving a car is OK, I guess, but it’s not a very “gamer” activity. Thankfully, Google’s navigation app Waze has a newly announced feature that will allow drivers to activate a Halo theme. Drivers can pick between either the Banished War Chief Escharum or my boy Master Chief, who will offer gruff navigation guidance and color commentary. 
This limited-time feature promotes the upcoming Halo Infinite, which is currently planned for a holiday 2021 release on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
Not only will the tones of Master Chief or Escharum guide you along roads, but drivers can also change their in-app car icon to a Warthog or Ghost, and apply one of the two characters to their profile. You can also have Master Chief update you in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese.
You can hear a sample of Waze’s new Halo-themed content, including a warning about heavy traffic from Escharum, over at Xbox Wire.
Master Chief is one of the icons of the Xbox, which means he’s a common choice for cross promotion. He also reared his head in Sea of Thieves as a ship figurehead in the Spartan set,  and showed up in Fortnite.</span>

Improved grip, trigger surfaces help you hang on through heavy action
 A new Xbox Wireless Controller is now available for pre-order, and it will ship on Aug. 31. The Aqua Shift Special Edition features a pearlescent blue color scheme, as well as an improved grip texture that wraps the controller’s triggers, bumper buttons, and back casing.
The launch model controller for the Xbox Series X has corrugated surfaces on the same parts, but they are part of the plastic casing. Microsoft’s announcement on Tuesday emphasized that the Aqua Shift’s grips are an additional, rubberized component, the first time a standard Xbox Wireless Controller has gotten this treatment.
“Aqua Shift is the first Special Edition Xbox Series X|S controller to feature rubberized side grips with a unique dual color swirl on every unit,” the statement said. “Textured grip on the triggers, bumpers, and back case makes sure you stay connected to the game no matter how intense things get.”
The controller is $69.99, $10 more than the MSRP for a standard Xbox Wireless Controller. It’s compatible with the Xbox One, as well as Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices, all of which can now stream games from the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate library.</span>

Viego? More like, Vieg-NO
 Riot Games has introduced a new event to the world of Runeterra, where the Ruined King Viego scours the world of League of Legends in search of his dead wife’s soul. To send him and his undead army back, an ancient order called the Sentinels of Light rise up. The group’s leaders, Senna and Lucian, gather up an unlikely band of champions to fight back.
That storyline culminated Tuesday in a new cinematic called Absolution. In Absolution, the Sentinels finally rock up on Viego’s doorstep to put his dastardly campaign to an end. Viego and his servants face off against the Sentinels, new champion Akshan uses his special death-undoing weapon to save the day, and Viego is chained in his kingdom of Camavor. It’s a neat ending to an ambitious event.
Players can still log into Wild Rift and the PC League of Legends client to see visual novel-style stories that expand on the events of the cinematic, the Sentinels and their relationships with one another, and the deep lore of characters, like upcoming champion Vex.</span>

Run over zombies and zombie cows in Bugbear’s new update
 The spirit of classic, violent racing game series Carmageddon is coming to Wreckfest, Bugbear Entertainment’s demolition derby-themed racing game. A new update adds a new car, two new tracks, and streets filled with zombies (and zombie cows) to plow through. Wreckfest’s latest tournament borrows its visuals from the original Carmageddon, a pixelated mess by modern standards, which gives it a sense of charm.
Wreckfest players will be able to race through two vintage Carmageddon tracks (Bleak City and Death Canyon) and ride in the sawblade-adorned Eagle R car, which appeared in 2016’s Carmageddon: Max Damage.
The action is certainly less sadistic than the original Carmageddon, which awarded players bonus points for running over innocent pedestrians. Wreckfest’s version of vehicular homicide is more about cleaning up the streets of undead, with palatable splashes of green, pixelated blood splashing across the screen.
Wreckfest is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. We called its brand of destruction-filled racing some of the most fun we had in 2019. The Carmageddon series kicked off in 1997, with Stainless Games’ original game for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows PC. The developer followed that game with a series of sequels, including Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now, Carmageddon TDR 2000, and Carmageddon: Reincarnation.</span>

                    <span>For his video series for Eater, Daniel Geneen took a tour of the Lodge Cast Iron factory in South Pittsburg, Tennessee to see how cast iron skillets are made.
While all of this is happening, molds for pans are being made out of fine, pliable sand that’s compressed in massive machines. The ladles pour the molten metal into these molds. Once the metal is poured and cooled, the sand molds get placed into a shake-out machine that shakes the sand away from the pan, and then into an enormous drum to shake off the rest. The pans are finally put on a giant conveyor belt to be sorted and inspected. Any pans that are not up to muster get thrown back into the original scrap heap to be melted down again and remade into another pan.


In comparison, here’s how Borough Furnace makes their cast iron pans by hand in their much smaller workshop:

Very similar process, down to the sand molds, just on a much smaller and more hands-on scale.

                    <span>Among Giants is a short documentary about a group of activists who lived in the trees of a Humboldt County redwood forest for four years in order to stop logging in the area.
Risking injury and incarceration, an environmental activist disrupts the clear-cutting of an ancient redwood grove by sitting on a tiny platform a hundred feet up in the tree canopy. Already three years into the tree-sit when filming begins, AMONG GIANTS blends vérité cinematography with intimate personal reflection to create a vivid picture of life in the trees and the unwavering dedication of the activists.


The activists’ tree-sit was successful — 1000 acres of the redwood forest were transferred to a public trust to create the McKay Community Forest. (via the morning news)

                    <span>Before this morning, I had never heard of Lusia Harris and now she’s one of my favorite basketball players. Playing in the 1970s, before the enforcement of Title IX in athletics, the 6’3” Harris dominated in high school, led a small university to three consecutive national basketball championships in the first 5 years of the program (while averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds per game), scored the first basket in Olympics women’s basketball history, is the only woman ever officially drafted by an NBA team, and was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. And those aren’t even her proudest achievements — you’ll have to watch the video for that.
For an electrifying young basketball player on the national stage, success often comes with a lucrative professional contract and brand deals — but Harris’s moment came in the 1970s, decades before the W.N.B.A. was founded, when few opportunities were available to female athletes interested in pursuing a professional career. In Ben Proudfoot’s “The Queen of Basketball,” Harris tells the story of what happens when an unstoppable talent runs out of games to win.


This video is part of the NY Times’ Almost Famous series, which also includes stories about radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell and actress/singer Kim Hill.

                    <span>Reese Witherspoon&#x27;s media company &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; recently courted various buyers, and while Apple was one of parties interested in buying Hello Sunshine, the Cupertino company did not end up going through with the purchase.





Hello Sunshine was valued at around $900 million thanks to its involvement in popular series like The Morning Show,&quot; &quot;Big Little Lies,&quot; and &quot;Little Fires Everywhere,&quot; and it would have marked Apple&#x27;s largest media purchase to date had a deal been established.



Instead, Hello Sunshine is being purchased by an upcoming media venture run by two former Disney executives backed by Blackstone Group. According to The Wall Street Journal, the purchase was made as part of a plan to build an independent entertainment company.



There is no word on how much was paid for Hello Sunshine, but Reese Witherspoon and current CEO Sarah Harden will join the board of the new company and will continue to operate it.



Though Apple did not purchase Hello Sunshine, the two companies will continue to work together. Hello Sunshine is responsible for &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and it is involved in multiple upcoming Apple TV+ projects including &quot;Surface&quot; starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, &quot;The Last Thing He Told Me&quot; with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series &quot;My Kind of Country.&quot;



Recent rumors have suggested that Apple is exploring other purchase opportunities and has expressed interest in film studio A24. A24 has developed hit movies like &quot;Hereditary,&quot; &quot;Moonlight,&quot; &quot;Lady Bird,&quot; and &quot;Midsommar,&quot; plus it already has a content deal with Apple.



A24 and Apple have partnered on &quot;Mr. Corman&quot; and &quot;On the Rocks&quot; along with and upcoming films &quot;Sharper,&quot; &quot;The Sky is Everywhere,&quot; &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Bride,&quot; and more.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple must face a patent infringement lawsuit over the heart rate technology in the Apple Watch, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled today.





Back in 2018, Apple was sued by Omni MedSci, with the company alleging that Apple used its patented technology in the Apple Watch. Apple reportedly met with Omni MedSci between 2014 to 2016 to discuss a possible partnership, but Apple is said to have ended discussions and used technology from four Omni patents anyway.



According to Reuters, Apple attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed.



Omni MedSci is owned by Mohammed Islam, who has been described as a &quot;poster child for a patenting professional.&quot; He owns six companies and has collected more than 150 patents. In the past, he has used those patents to sue companies that include Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia, and Siemens.



Islam is employed by the University of Michigan, and Apple&#x27;s argument for dismissal was that his patents were owned by the university, which the University of Michigan supported on behalf of Apple. The appeals court decided that was not the case, and that Islam&#x27;s employment agreement did not automatically assign his patents to the university.



Omni MedSci has claimed that Apple willfully infringed on its patents. The company is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of the Apple Watch, along with damages. Omni MedSci&#x27;s attorney told Reuters that the company is &quot;pleased by not surprised&quot; by the ruling.

                    <span>Twitter&#x27;s &quot;Sign in With Apple&quot; feature is now widely available to iPhone and iPad users, following a beta test earlier this month.





Downloading the Twitter app presents an option to &quot;Continue with Apple,&quot; which is available alongside the &quot;Continue with Google&quot; or &quot;Create Account&quot; options.




Sign on with ease and start scrolling your timeline. 
Now, when you log in or sign up to join the conversation on Twitter, you have the option to use:
▪️ Your Google Account on the app and on web
▪️ Or your Apple ID on iOS, and soon on web pic.twitter.com/Nf56H1ghmY
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) August 2, 2021
 


Using Sign in With Apple, Twitter users who wish to create a new account can do so with their Apple IDs, and can elect to hide their true email addresses from Twitter. Signing up is as simple as confirming an account with Face ID, though Twitter users will still need to provide a date of birth and other info.



Account names appear to be generated based on user name and can be changed afterward, but there are some limitations to be aware of. Since Sign in with Apple does not create a password, it can be difficult to change an account&#x27;s email address, select a new profile name, or deactivate an account.



Twitter says that ‌Sign in with Apple‌ support will be coming soon to the web.

                    <span>In iOS 15, Apple&#x27;s Maps app benefits from a range of new features and improvements, including the ability to use augmented reality walking directions in big cities.





In a nod to Google Maps, the new AR mode can map walking directions onto the real world by using your iPhone&#x27;s rear camera, making it easier to see where you need to go in built-up areas and reducing the need to look down at your smartphone as you move.



First, initiate a walking route, then simply raise your ‌iPhone‌ and scan the buildings around you when prompted. The step-by-step directions will appear in the AR mode automatically, which should make it easier to get where you need to go, especially in situations where the directions are tricky.





The AR feature is available from late 2021 in major supported cities including London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadephia, San Diego, San Francisco and Washington DC.



Note that to get augmented reality walking directions, your ‌iPhone‌ will need an A12 chip or later. The A12 was first used in the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ XS, XS Max, and XR, which came out in 2018, which means that iPhones released after 2018 are compatible with the AR feature.

                    <span>The iPhone 13 is widely expected to come with Wi-Fi 6E capabilities, and while it may seem rather nuanced to the average consumer, with only improved speeds and being &quot;up to date&quot; in the realm of Wi-Fi technology, it&#x27;s actually a fairly significant improvement, laying the groundwork for much of what we know the future holds.





To truly understand Wi-Fi 6E, MacRumors sat down for an exclusive interview with Kevin Robinson, senior vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, to discuss the new generation of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi&#x27;s relationship with 5G, and what new experiences it will enable. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a group few have probably heard of, but as Kevin describes it, it&#x27;s a crucial part of the Wi-Fi puzzle, consisting of a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; in the connectivity space.

                    <span>Apple has leaped from third to first place for profit and from twelfth to sixth place for revenue in the Fortune Global 500 rankings of the world&#x27;s biggest companies.





After reaching a record high of $33.3 trillion in last year&#x27;s rankings, total revenue for the world&#x27;s biggest companies fell 4.8 percent to $31.7 trillion this year. Even so, the combined sales of all of the companies on the list are equal to over one-third of global GDP. Walmart was again the world&#x27;s largest company, for the eighth consecutive year.



Apple&#x27;s revenue is reported as $274.515 billion, of which $57.411 billion is profit. This is a moderate increase from last year, when the company&#x27;s revenue was reported to be $260.174 billion, of which $55.256 billion was profit. Apple is also estimated to now h…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>YouTube is piloting a new cheaper subscription tier in Europe called &quot;Premium Lite,&quot; which offers ad-free viewing minus YouTube Premium&#x27;s other features.





First spotted by a user on ResetEra and subsequently confirmed by Google, the &quot;Lite&quot; plan means users who aren&#x27;t interested in offline downloads or background playback can still enjoy YouTube videos on web and mobile app without being interrupted by ads. 



A YouTube spokesperson told The Verge: 

&quot;In Nordics and Benelux (except for Iceland), we&#x27;re testing a new offering to give users even more choice: Premium Lite costs €6.99/month (or local equivalent per month) and it includes ad-free videos on YouTube.&quot; 
A standard YouTube Premium plan costs around €11.99/£11.99 a month in Europe and $11.99 in the United States, and includes ad-free viewing on web, mobile app, smart TVs and consoles, as well as ad-free YouTube Music listening, background playback, and offline downloads.



As The Verge notes, the &quot;Lite&quot; option costs around 60% of the price of a Premium plan but only offers a quarter of the features. However, YouTube says that the subscription plan is still in an experimental phase, and that it could still roll out more plans to gauge user feedback.

The details appeared Sunday in a tweeted photo, since deleted, by EVP and GM of Intel&#x27;s Client Computing Group, Gregory Bryant, who was documenting his visit to Intel&#x27;s R&amp;D labs in Israel.



As outlined by AnandTech, the photo from a Thunderbolt-related tour revealed a poster on a lab wall with the words &quot;80G PHY Technology,&quot; suggesting TB5 connectivity will support up to 80 Gb/s throughput, or double the bandwidth of existing Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 connections.

                    <span>For future iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, Apple plans to use smaller internal components in an effort to increase the size of the device&#x27;s battery, according to DigiTimes.

Specifically, Apple plans to &quot;significantly increase the adoption&quot; of IPDs or integrated passive devices for the peripheral chips in its products. These news chips will be slimmer in size and allow for higher performance while also taking up less internal space inside a device, allowing for larger batteries.

Apple is expected to significantly increase the adoption of IPD (integrated passive devices) for new iPhones and other iOS products, providing robust business opportunities for manufacturing partners TSMC and Amkor, according to industry sources.

                    <span>The Australian government has introduced support for adding COVID-19 vaccination digital certificates to Apple Wallet via the Express Plus Medicare app on iOS.




Image credit: Tap Down Under 


As spotted by Tap Down Under, users who have received two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine now have access to the digital certificate through their Medicare online account or via the Medicare app, downloadable as a PDF or by using the &quot;Add to Apple Wallet&quot; option.



The front of the digital certificate includes the user&#x27;s date of birth, document number, and the &quot;valid from&quot; date, which indicates the date the second dose was received. The back of the pass includes the individual&#x27;s Healthcare Identifier, what vaccine was received, and the date of both doses.



The Australian digital certificate is official proof of COVID-19 vaccination should it become needed domestically or for travel, and is separate from any other immunizations the individual may have received. The certificate is similar to digital passes generated by some other government apps, such as the UK&#x27;s NHS COVID pass scheme.

                    <span>James Surowiecki:
When the CDC changed its guidance on masking earlier this week — recommending, among other things, that even vaccinated people start wearing masks in indoor public spaces in areas of substantial to high Covid transmission — it cited “unpublished data” as a reason for its decision. The next day, the internal CDC document that seems to have prompted the shift was published — by the Washington Post. And when major news media got a look at, the message they sent vaccinated people was pretty simple: “Panic!”
This reaction was not justified by the actual data in the CDC document.
Headlines matter, and the headlines for these stories have been grossly misleading.

The AppleDesign Keyboard is a cheap cost-cutting imitation of the Extended Keyboard. It doesn’t even have an embedded Apple logo, just its silhouette punched into the mold of plastic. The symbolism that Apple was only a shadow of its former self in the mid-90s could not be any clearer.
I rate it 2⁄5 stars.
Spot-on reviews.

Taking a look at the moves made by one of the busiest teams in the league.
 As the lights dimmed on the 2020-21 season, sights were set on what was expected to be an extremely active Summer for the Flyers. In short, it’s arrived. Chuck Fletcher, who recently sat down with us for a one-on-one interview, made it known that he won’t hesitate to make big changes to the roster when needed. But change isn’t inherently good, it has to be the right change. So, how do we feel about the trades that he’s made?
IN: Ryan Ellis
OUT: Phil Myers, Nolan Patrick
Brad: I think that Myers still has a very good chance to become an above-average top-four defender in Nashville, but last season certainly opened up the idea of him being a classic “all the tools” …</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Even in a condensed offseason, August is the most boring month of the year, hockey-wise. Everyone is at the cottage. Moves have been made. Settle in, folks. In the meantime, did you catch our interview with Chuck? [BSH]
*In the event that Chuck does want to do something this month, there are still a few not-bad free agents available. [The Athletic]
*Meltzer takes a look back at Carter Hart’s struggles last season. [Hockeybuzz]
*Blissfully, it doesn’t seem like Chuck Fletcher has taken the Tom Wilson bait yet. But most of the Metro has! [ProHockeyTalk]
*Speaking of players that are still available, the Jack Eichel situation appears to be getting messier by the day. [Die By The Blade]
*When the Golden Knights traded Marc-Andre Fleury to the Blackhawks, some speculated that he might rather retire from hockey than play for that trash team, but alas, he’s gonna play for them. [Sportsnet]
*Over the weekend we learned a bit about what Evander Kane has been up to and it is... not great. [AP]
*It was a big summer for free agent defensemen, and next summer there are a few more that might be looking for a big payday. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, in case you missed it Friday, the latest BSH Radio! [BSH]</span>

 The recent wave of news coming from large gaming companies has me feeling even more appreciative that I get to write this column. It’s just nice to highlight the inventive work of people who aren’t, ya know, a giant corporation being sued by a state in a giant sex discrimination lawsuit. To this end, I picked out Fostering Apocalypse, a survival game part of the Shorter Games With Worse Graphics bundle. It’s a sale to benefit developers so they can — you got it — make worse games for more money. Hell yeah!

Tony Moretti’s the man to know around Los Santos
 Living in Los Santos isn’t easy, especially when you’re an average civilian. In your average game of Grand Theft Auto Online, the world runs on Looney Tunes logic — people are running through the streets on flying motorcycles and calling orbital strikes down upon their enemies. 
On the game’s unofficial role-play servers, however, things are calmer, and there’s room for individual characters to thrive. Take, for example, a character named Tony Moretti, a former mafioso and made man who runs his own, very elaborate cab company business.
In GTA Online role-play servers, the majority of people aren’t the kind of criminals you’d associate with Grand Theft Auto lawlessness. Instead, they’re civilians scraping toget…</span>

Fight Rainbow doppelgangers in three-week Containment event
 Rainbow Six Siege is getting a new, limited-time event, and it’s a tie-in for the series’ next game, Rainbow Six Extraction.
Containment, as the PvP event is called, begins Aug. 3 and runs until Aug. 24. Monday’s announcement said Containment is “inspired by the upcoming game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction,” which was re-titled from Rainbow Six Quarantine during an E3 2021 reveal in June.
Containment will take place on a reworked version of the Consulate map. In-game, the building is overrun by the Chimera parasite, whose outbreak forms the narrative context of Extraction. It was also the basis of Operation Chimera, an expansion for Siege that launched in 2018, which introduced a cooperative event called Outbreak.
Containment’s new playlist is called Nest Destruction. Players will get a look at REACT, the faction that will be doing most of the cleanup in Extraction. In Nest Destruction, the Attackers are REACT agents (a news release in July said Rainbow operators Ash, Mira, and Thermite formed this squad). The Defenders are alien shapeshifters who look like REACT teammates, but can only use melee attacks. Attackers are there to destroy the nest, Defenders are there to destroy the Attackers.
Containment will offer 33 unique items, including uniforms and weapon skins, for operators IQ, Ace, Blackbeard, Amaru, Zero, Aruni, Jager, Kaid, Mira, and Warden. These items are available in Siege’s shop for 1680 R6 credits, or in Containment Packs that run 300 R6 credits or 12,500 renown.
Rainbow Six Extraction was originally expected to launch Sept. 16, but in mid-July, Ubisoft announced it was postponing that release until January 2022. Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, with streaming versions on Amazon Luna and Google Stadia.</span>

Welcome to Emergence
 It’s once again time for a new Apex Legends season. While Respawn Entertainment has already teased the season’s new features over the past few weeks, we didn’t get the actual patch notes until Monday, and they show plenty of balance changes to switch things up.
Several Legends got changes in this patch, including Caustic, Horizon, and Fuse, along with some quality-of-life tweaks given to Revenant. Caustic’s adjustments mostly deal with making his gas canisters a little stronger, dealing more damage and giving them a slightly shorter cooldown. 
The other Legend with big changes in season 10 is Fuse, whose Knuckle Cluster Tactical explosion now lasts twice as long. Fuse’s Ultimate ability also now reveals enemies tra…</span>

343 Industries version of a firing range makes trying new weapons extremely easy
 Picking up a weapon in Halo isn’t always as simple as point and shoot. While it’s not the  Ratchet &amp; Clank series, Halo is known for unconventional weapons like the Spartan Laser or the long-standing needler. With all the weapons spawning around the map and not in the player’s hands, it can create a bit of a learning curve. But Halo Infinite’s new weapon drills solve that problem.
Over the last weekend, I spent several hours checking out Halo Infinite in its first technical test. When I loaded up the preview on Friday, the first thing I did was drop into the game’s weapon drills to see the new and changed weapons.

Eric Baptizat left Ubisoft in 2020 after 16 years
 Eric Baptizat, game director on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and many other Ubisoft projects, is the current game director for EA Motive’s recently announced Dead Space remake. Baptizat left Ubisoft after 16 years in 2020 and joined EA to work on an unannounced title. He’s since confirmed via his LinkedIn page that he’s helming the new Dead Space title, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.
While Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was Baptizat’s first gig as game director, he served as lead game designer on several other games, namely Assassin’s Creed Origins, Assassin’s Creed Unity, and Assassin’s Creed Black Flag. 
The Dead Space remake is both a remaster and spiritual successor to the original game. The game will still take place on the USG Ishimura, the mining starship from the original, but will have “an improved story, characters, gameplay mechanics, and more.” The remake was rumored to be in development for months prior to its announcement at EA Play 2021. 
EA Motive has yet to offer a release window for the Dead Space remake, but said the game will eventually come to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.</span>

                    <span>Models of the Apple Watch Series 6 with titanium cases part of the &quot;Apple Watch Edition&quot; collection is currently widely unavailable for pick-up in several of Apple&#x27;s retail stores in the United States and is unavailable entirely for delivery in major markets.





Noted by Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, titanium models of the ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌, which starts at $799, is currently listed as unavailable in the US and other major markets for pick-up in retail stores and delivery. Apple hasn&#x27;t stated the Apple Watch Edition for the Series 6 is being discontinued; however, with less than two months before the Apple Watch Series 7 is released, Gurman hypothesizes what the latest shortage could mean.

Apple hasn&#x27;t said that the Apple Watch Edition is discontinued, so here&#x27;s my theory. With just weeks to go until the next version of the Apple Watch, Apple has nearly run out of the titanium models. Given the high price point, Apple probably only made a small amount expecting they wouldn&#x27;t sell very well. They likely stopped manufacturing them months ago and are finally running out of supply. 



We&#x27;ll see if Apple chooses to keep titanium for the Apple Watch Series 7, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the company ditched the pricier Edition material, as it did in the past with both ceramic and real gold. Seriously, what&#x27;s the point of spending $800 or more on a watch that will be outdated in one year and nonfunctional in under five? 
As Gurman points out, Apple previously sold, then ended the selling of &quot;Apple Watch Edition&quot; models with ceramic and gold. Apple may also decide to end the titanium Apple Watch models later this fall.

                    <span>Shawn King, writing for The Loop:
But I remember having my spidey senses tingle last year with these
awards so I did some digging into it. The first thing I noticed
was you have to “pay to play” — that is, it costs $5.50 to submit
a single image with “discounts” given for multiple image
submissions. Paying to submit images to a contest is not
necessarily a bad thing but it always raises concerns for me.
Next up was the judges — or lack thereof. In an interview
with Input, the founder of the IPPAWARDS Kenan Aktulun
(whose Twitter account is protected) wouldn’t say who the
judges were:
I asked Aktulun to share some details behind the curtains about
the judging process. Though he wouldn’t say specifically who the
panel of judges was for the 2020 winners, he said they were made
up of a diverse cast of visual storytellers including
photographers and designers.
That’s always a red flag for me. Every reputable photo completion,
from Apple on down, lists the names of the people doing the
judging.
The prizes are sort of shitty too.

Grande could be the biggest thing in Fortnite since Travis Scott
 Ariana Grande is the next performer to get a massive Fortnite in-game concert. The popstar will be featured in-game as part of the Rift Tour event in August, Epic Games announced on Sunday with a short teaser video on Twitter. 
The Rift Tour event will be a massive in-game musical spectacular and will add several cosmetic items to the game, including an official Ariana Grande Icon series outfit to the shop — if certain leaks are correct. 
Excuse us, Ariana is coming!

Arc System Works’ long-running fighting game has opened up
 Guilty Gear is one of the longest-running legacy fighting game series out there. Since the first installment in 1998, it’s been held in high regard by fighting game diehards. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean much to the average gamer looking for a new fighting game to play. To attract new players, Guilty Gear needs to learn from other fighting games and change up its formula, something it’s done with great success in the latest entry, Guilty Gear Strive.


There are a set few fight game series that are able to crack that casual consciousness. Games like Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Super Smash Bros., and even Virtua Fighter are among the few that you may be…</span>

                    <span>This week saw an interesting range of Apple news and rumors, including a blockbuster earnings report, rumors about next year&#x27;s &quot;iPhone 14&quot; and Face ID coming to Macs, and more.

Face ID Expected to Come to Mac Within a &#x27;Couple of Years&#x27;


While it has been nearly four years since Face ID debuted on the iPhone X, the facial recognition feature has yet to expand to the Mac. However, that could change in the not too distant future, as Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman …</span>

                    <span>Telegram Messenger has received a major update to its video capabilities, including support for video calls with up to 1,000 viewers. 





Group video calls in Telegram allow up to 30 users to stream video from both their camera and their screen, and now a maximum of 1,000 people can tune into the broadcast. Telegram says it intends to continue increasing this limit &quot;until all humans on Earth can join one group call.&quot;



Meanwhile, video messages now have a higher resolution, and any audio playing on the user&#x27;s device will keep playing when a message is being captured so that it&#x27;s included in the recording. 



In addition, users can now tap on a video message to expand it in the conversation thread. Tapping on an expanded video message initially pauses it, and it&#x27;s also possible to fast-forward and rewind the message.



Elsewhere in this update, the media player now supports multiple video playback speeds, screen sharing has been added to one-on-one calls, the in-app camera supports all zoom levels a device is capable of, and the media editor includes new tools to illustrate photos and videos with drawings, text, and stickers.



Several other smaller tweaks and improvements have made it into this bumper update, and Telegram has further details in its latest blog post. Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>E.J. Dickson, reporting for Rolling Stone:
“I think I had the same reservations that many people had,” Bob, who requested that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, tells Rolling Stone.
Then Bob saw a tweet from Goddess Alexandra Snow, a professional dominatrix and dungeon owner who operates Wicked Eden, a BDSM collective based in Columbus, Ohio. The tweet stated that any submissives who wanted to session with Snow in person would have to show proof of vaccination. Bob had been subscribing to Goddess Snow’s OnlyFans and “tributing” her (giving her money) for almost two years, and he got in touch with her to discuss whether or not he should get the vaccine. “It was less about convincing me and more about her confirming to me that it was the right thing to do,” he says. He got his final shot three weeks ago. “It [feels] good to know that I’m (hopefully) contributing to others not falling seriously ill,” he says. “And of course, it’s gratifying to know I’ve done something that Goddess Snow approves of.”

Our Guardian is facing a never-before-seen challenge: local politics
 Since 2017, Destiny 2 players have had to contend with a game that by and large still silos off the most colorful aspects of its fiction in dense lore books; story moments are relegated to dialogue in the comms channel, the explosive defeat of Big Enemies, and the cameo appearance of NPC models who by and large just stand there, deliver exposition, then transmat out of the game space before we move on to the next weekly space wizard chore.
This is a problem that’s obviously on the minds of Destiny 2’s creators.
In Luke Smith’s 2019 blog post at Bungie.net, “Director’s Cut — Part III,” the Destiny 2 director lays out his vision for an “evolving” game world.

                    <span>Here’s a description of what the machine featured in this video does: “The HD Video Feedback Kinetic Sculpture creates fractals and organic-looking images in real-time, without a computer: this is old-school video feedback.” But just watch the video for the full effect — this thing produces some amazing imagery.
This is part sculpture, part performance art, and may make the most complex video feedback ever created, using three cameras, two video switchers, a sheet of beam-splitter glass, and an HDMI input from a phone or live video feed.
Much like a musical instrument, the operator at the helm of this device plays it, but instead of making sounds, makes entire worlds, spirals within spirals, loops within loops, galaxies, classical fractal imagery and primordial organisms, leaves, trees, and insects. It really is the God machine.

                    <span>Since introducing the unified Find My app, Apple has been working to improve the ‌Find My‌ experience. iOS 15 brings some major new features to ‌Find My‌, including features like live locations and the ability to track an iPhone even after it&#x27;s been erased or powered off.





This guide covers everything that Apple added to the ‌Find My‌ app in ‌iOS 15‌.



Live Locations


When you track a friend or a family member using the ‌Find My‌ app, it now shows continuous streaming updates on their location rather than updating with a new location every few minutes.



Apple says that this feature is designed to provide an immediate sense of speed, direction, and progress when you&#x27;re looking at someone&#x27;s location.

                    <span>&quot;Unicorn Hunters,&quot; a YouTube and Facebook show starring Apple-cofounder Steve Wozniak and singer Lance Bass as judges, is aiming to make its way to television, reports Variety.





The show aims to find &quot;unicorn&quot; companies, which are startups able to reach a $1 billion valuation. A panel of investors called the &quot;Circle of Money&quot; serve as judges on the show, in a format that&#x27;s similar to &quot;Shark Tank.&quot; Circle of Money members include Steve Wozniak, Lance Bass, Moe Vela, Silvina Moschini, Alex Konanykhin, Scott Livingston, and Rosa Rios.
Unicorn is the name given to startup companies with a valuation of over one billion dollars. If you spot one and invest in it at an early stage, you could potentially earn enormous returns on your investment.

                    <span>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter today to criticize Apple&#x27;s App Store fees in a tweet that sides with Epic in the ongoing Epic v. Apple dispute.





&quot;Epic is right,&quot; wrote Musk, before going on to call Apple&#x27;s ‌App Store‌ fees a &quot;de facto global tax on the Internet.&quot;



Musk earlier this week made veiled comments about ‌App Store‌ fees, but today&#x27;s statement is a much more direct criticism.



During Tesla&#x27;s earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was planning to let other companies use its charger network because Tesla does not want to &quot;create a walled garden&quot; and use that to &quot;bludgeon&quot; competitors. Musk said that this is a tactic used by &quot;some companies,&quot; and then he fake coughed and said &quot;Apple.&quot;

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/ipad-shipments-q2-2021-idc/">

                    <span>While the iPad has long been the world&#x27;s most popular tablet, newly published market research helps put Apple&#x27;s lead into perspective.



According to estimates shared by research firm IDC, Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter of 2021. By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.





A big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like Strategy Analytics and Canalys have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn&#x27;t change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.





iPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.



The launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.

                    <span>Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly once demanded that he be made Apple CEO in a brief discussion of a potential acquisition with Apple&#x27;s current CEO, Tim Cook. The claim comes in a new book titled &quot;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk and the Bet of the Century,&quot; as reviewed by The Los Angeles Times.





According to the book, during a 2016 phone call between Musk and Cook that touched on the possibility of Apple purchasing Tesla, Musk told Cook that a purchase of Telsa by Apple could only go forward if he became CEO of the combined company. 
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk are talking on the phone. The 2016 unveiling of the make-it-or-break-it Model 3 is coming soon, but Tesla is in serious financial trouble. Cook has an idea: Apple buys Tesla.

                    <span>A few years ago, Apple announced that it would be revamping its Maps app with more detailed maps, better road coverage, and faster and more accurate navigation. The improvements have since rolled out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and Apple is focusing on Italy next.





According to Apple Maps enthusiast Justin O&#x27;Beirne, Apple recently started testing its revamped Maps experience across the Italian Peninsula, including San Marino and Vatican City. The updated maps appear to be limited to devices with the iOS 15 developer or public betas installed for now, but at WWDC 2021 last month, Apple announced that its revamped Maps experience would be expanded to all users in Italy and Australia later this year.



In early 2020, Apple said it would begin rolling out the revamped Maps experience across Europe in the coming months, so other countries should soon follow. The updated maps provide more comprehensive views of roads, buildings, parks, airports, shopping malls, sports venues like baseball fields and tennis courts, and other details.

Last month, &quot;Legends of Kingdom Rush,&quot; &quot;Game Dev Story+,&quot; &quot;Frenzic: Overtime,&quot; &quot;INKS.+,&quot; and &quot;Leo&#x27;s Fortune+&quot; arrived on Apple Arcade.

The factory, known as &quot;Fab 18,&quot; is TSMC&#x27;s most advanced chipmaking facility. TSMC is Apple&#x27;s sole chip supplier, making all of the processors used in every Apple device with a custom silicon chip.



Industry sources speaking to Nikkei Asia said that all of the processors for Apple&#x27;s upcoming ‌iPhone‌ and Mac devices are produced at this facility.

The acceptance of RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI)  cards means Apple users in India will be able to use the domestic payment systems as alternatives to regular credit/debit card payment methods to add funds to their Apple ID balance. 



They can then use their ‌Apple ID‌ balance to buy apps, games, music, iCloud storage, and more in Apple&#x27;s online stores.



RuPay was launched in India in 2012, and facilitates real-time electronic payments at all Indian banks and financial institutions. The massively popular instant payments network UPI followed in 2016.

 *So now that Chuck is done (ostensibly), we’ve got the long hot August between us and players on the ice. Sigh. Anyhoo, Charlie looks at the last two moves Chuck made this week: Martin Jones and Nate Thompson. [The Athletic]
*If there’s one thing we can take from Chuck’s offseason it’s that he is ready for this team to win now. This isn’t a man building for the future. [NBC Sports Philly]
*But there were some risks taken. Last summer, Chuck bet that his players would repeat their performance from the end of the regular season. He lost that bet. This year, he’s better that a couple of his new players will improve. We’ll see how it goes. [BSH]
*We spoke with Alex from The Cannon to get a little inside information about Cam Atkinson. [BSH]
*Our pal Michael Raffl has found a new home down south. [Defending Big D]
*It seemed like a Vladimir Tarasenko trade was imminent. And it still hasn’t happened. What’s up with that? [ProHockeyTalk]
*If you were worried about Ron Hextall going to the Penguins and making them into a winner again... well, he’s doing Ron Hextall things over there. We’re fine. [Pensburgh]
*And finally, just in time for your ride to the shore today, Steph had a chat with Chuck Fletcher yesterday and we learned some good stuff. Really really good stuff. [BSH]</span>

                    <span>It is a recurring theme in political circles that giant digital platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube engage in bad behavior—distributing disinformation, allowing hate speech, removing conservative opinions, and so on—in part because they are protected from legal liability by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says they aren’t responsible for content […]</span>

Get two weapons and some armor in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Wormhaven
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, Warlock helmet)
5 wins — Sola’s Scar, Solar sword
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps, Gauntlets, Gloves (Hunter, Titan, Warlock arms)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, north of the Hangar, standing on the back stairs.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:
Telesto, Void fusion rifle: 29 Legendary Shards
Lucky Pants, Hunter pants: 23 Legendary Shards
Actium War Rig, Titan chest: 23 Legendary Shards
Claws of Ahamkara, Warlock arms: 23 Legendary Shards

Exotic Cipher quest: free


Xur’s items drop at a similar power level as your character.

If you’re Boomerang X-ing correctly, you’ll never touch the ground
 Boomerang X made me feel like a genius, like I was getting something over on a hard game by circumventing its level design. It wasn’t until I reached the game’s truly difficult sections — the end of the whole thing — that I began to realize I was not a god-tier game-breaking genius, but that developer Dang! spent the entire game teaching me to fly.
What originally felt like an overpowered exploit of Boomerang X’s mechanics turns out to be mandatory if you want to succeed.
What is Boomerang X?

                    <span>This is fantastic: for more than 60 years beginning in 1899, Lora Webb Nichols captured and collected about 24,000 photographs of life in a small copper-mining town in Wyoming.
On October 28, 1899, Lora Webb Nichols was at her family’s homestead, near Encampment, Wyoming, reading “Five Little Peppers Midway,” when her beau, Bert Oldman, came to the door to deliver a birthday present. The sixteen-year-old Nichols would marry the thirty-year-old Oldman the following year, and divorce him a decade later. The gift, however — a Kodak camera — would change the course of her life. Between 1899 and her death, in 1962, Nichols created and collected some twenty-four thousand negatives documenting life in her small Wyoming town, whose fortunes boomed and then busted along with the region’s copper mines. What Nichols left behind might be the largest photographic record of this era and region in existence: thousands of portraits, still-lifes, domestic interiors, and landscapes, all made with an unfussy, straightforward, often humorous eye toward the small textures and gestures of everyday life.


You can browse the collection of her photos at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.

                    <span>This video from Vox takes a look at how Taiwan avoided a Covid-19 outbreak for more than a year (and kept total deaths to just 7 in 2020 in a country of 23.6 million) while residents were mostly able to go about their normal lives. The video features photojournalist Ed Ou, who underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine when he traveled to Taiwan last year. Ou had this to say after spending time in Taiwan, doing normal things without lockdowns or restrictions:
This was an alternate universe of what America, and the rest of the world, had seen all year. The Taiwanese people had been able to just live their lives, as if nothing had happened. Like, to me, that’s freedom.


After more than a year of almost no cases, Taiwan experienced its first Covid-19 outbreak in May (after relaxing their quarantine rules and, presumably, the rise of the delta variant) but has since gotten it under control. Other countries that had been successful in controlling the virus until recently — like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia — are also seeing outbreaks now. When the rest of the world is teeming with the virus, it becomes more likely over time that even the most organized and protected systems are going to be vulnerable.

                    <span>Apple today released watchOS 7.6.1, a minor update to the watchOS 7 operating system that was released in September 2020. watchOS 7.6.1 comes two weeks after the release of watchOS 7.6, an update that brought ECG capabilities to new regions.





‌‌The watchOS 7.6.1 update‌‌ can be downloaded for free through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the ‌iPhone‌ by going to General &gt; Software Update.



To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery, it needs to be placed on a charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, the watchOS 7.6.1 update includes important security updates and it is recommended for all users. An Apple security support document indicates that the update fixes a memory issue that may have been actively exploited in the wild, so Apple Watch users should upgrade as soon as possible. This is the same issue that Apple previously addressed in iOS 14.7.1 and macOS Big Sur 11.5.1.

Apple actually acquired the land for its new North Carolina campus in late 2018, purchasing about 280 acres in Research Triangle Park (RTP) near the state capital of Raleigh for around $50 million, but while Apple announced plans for a new campus in Austin, Texas, around that time, it remained silent on its RTP plans until this year.

                    <span>Apple today released the trailer for the second season of its Apple TV+ original show &quot;See,&quot; which will premiere with one episode on the platform on August 27, with new episodes following every Friday. The second season of the show will run for a total of eight episodes.






&quot;See&quot; was one of the first shows to premiere on ‌Apple TV+‌ in 2019 and features Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, and Alfre Woodard. The show follows the story of humanity losing the ability to see, and according to Apple, the second season will tell the story of Baba Voss, played by Jason Momoa, attempting to be reunited with his family. 

“See” is set in a brutal and primitive future, hundreds of years after humankind has lost the ability to see. In season two, Baba Voss (Momoa) is struggling to reunite his family while protecting them as the threat of war looms between the Kingdom of Paya and the Trivantian Republic. Despite his best efforts, his wife and sighted children are pulled to the forefront of the conflict, where they come to the attention of his estranged brother, Edo Voss (Bautista), a powerful and cunning Trivantian general, whose long-simmering hatred for his brother imperils them all even further.
The show&#x27;s second season premiere joins a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, with the second season of the hit comedy show Ted Lasso having premiered last week, and upcoming shows, such as &quot;The Morning Show&quot; with their second season premiering in September.

                    <span>Apple warned leakers that sharing information about unreleased products could mislead third-party accessory makers and disappoint customers, in cease and desist letters sent by legal firms representing the company.





Vice today highlighted that, in an extensive letter sent to a leaker based in China, Apple warned that leaks could give third-party accessory makers the wrong dimensions and details about unreleased products. It has emerged over the past month that June saw a concerted effort by Apple to curtail information coming from a range of individual leakers outside the United States using cease and desist letters.



Despite being sent by various local law firms representing Apple around the world, the letters appear to have featured identical content. An extract of one of…</span>

                    <span>Earlier this year, Google announced plans to follow in Apple&#x27;s footsteps and roll out privacy labels for apps on the Play Store next year. The new labels, much like Apple&#x27;s App Privacy labels, will inform users on what data an app collects about them, allowing them to make a more informed decision on whether to download a specific app.





Google has now shared additional information regarding the upcoming Play Store &quot;safety section.&quot; In a blog post, Android&#x27;s vice president of security and privacy, Suzanne Frey, laid out the company&#x27;s timeline for when developers will need to adopt the new labels. Android developers will be able to begin adding their app&#x27;s privacy information in October of 2021 and will be required to by April of 2022.

                    <span>Undeterred by Apple&#x27;s recent anti-tracking privacy changes, Facebook continues to rake in billions in advertising revenue, as evidenced by its latest fiscal 2021 second quarter results announced Wednesday.





On the company&#x27;s Q2 earnings call, the social network revealed it had accumulated $28 billion in ad revenue, representing a 56% year-on-year increase. That saw Facebook more than double its profits from the previous year, earning $10.4 billion, up from $5.2 billion in 2020.



Despite the figures for its main revenue stream, Facebook CFO David Wehner did note that the company expects to feel the brunt of Apple&#x27;s App Tracking Transparency rules in the third quarter.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Bang &amp; Olufsen today announced Beoplay EQ, the Danish audio outfit&#x27;s first true wireless headphones with adaptive active noise cancelation.





To achieve maximum noise cancelation, the buds use adaptive ANC that combines active noise cancellation with passive sealing. Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.



The Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they&#x27;re $150 more expensive than Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours&#x27; battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌&#x27;s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.



The compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than AirPods, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They&#x27;re IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. 





Wireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for iPhone licenses.



Beoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang &amp; Olufsen&#x27;s website and in Bang &amp; Olufsen retail stores.

                    <span>Zens today announced the launch of a new 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger that&#x27;s designed to work with Apple&#x27;s latest iPhone 12 models.





The 4-in-1 charger offers a magnetic charging puck that is compatible with the ‌iPhone 12‌. Zens says that it is a 15W magnetic charger, but it&#x27;s worth noting that third-party chargers that are not using Apple&#x27;s official MagSafe solution are limited to 7.5W Qi charging speeds.



The magnetic charger can be used with an iPhone in either portrait or landscape mode, and it places the ‌iPhone‌ at an ideal angle for watching videos, FaceTiming, and more.



In addition to the magnetic charging surface for an ‌iPhone 12‌, there&#x27;s also a 5W charging pad that can be used for a second ‌iPhone‌ or for the AirPods.



For the Apple Watch, there&#x27;s an included (and removable) Apple Watch charging puck, and along with these three charging options, there&#x27;s a built-in USB-A port for charging a fourth device. The 4-in-1 charger comes with a 30W PD power adapter.



The 4-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger can be purchased from the Zens website for 139.99 euros, which is right around $165. Zens offers worldwide shipping.

                    <span>I feel like someone just cracked my head like an egg and what landed in the frying pan was this video for “Amite River” from SPLLIT. Now my brain is bubbling away and getting crispy on the edges and the soundtrack is strange and urgent and disruptive. I love experimental music like this because it’s […]

                    <span>Aubrey Whelan, reporting for The Philadelphia Inquirer:
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia will soon require all its on-site employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as most of their patients are too young to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The hospital did not specify a deadline for employees to receive the vaccine, but said in a statement Thursday that it is “currently preparing for the implementation of a vaccine requirement.”
“We believe that it is our duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves, especially our young patients,” the statement read.

                    <span>Aaron E. Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:
Many may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and
distancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well
enough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did
when we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are
less likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed
by those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be
fought and ignored by those who aren’t.
Hospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because
someone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring
because too many people are not immunized.
This is why I’ve advocated vaccine mandates. I don’t understand
how we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.
Here’s German Lopez, making the same case at Vox:
A year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an
obviously smart decision. Mask mandates work, and for most of
2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread
of Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term
solution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the
world could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.
Now those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of
summer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a
mask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and
federal governments — should consider mandating something else
first: vaccination.
Asking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. The backlash is growing.

That seemed really fucked-up then, and even more fucked-up now.

We get some one on one time with the Flyers General Manager
 We sit down with Flyers General Manager Chuck Fletcher to talk about his time in Philadelphia, the moves he has made so far this offseason, and the general state of the team. This is part of a series we will continue through the season where we talk to Flyers players, coaches, and front office staff.
You can listen to this interview below or on any of the platforms where you listen to podcasts! Here are some of the highlights along with timestamps:
0:19
What have you learned about the Flyers organization that you didn’t know prior to 2018?
2:32
Can you tell me a little more about how you work with Flyers ownership?
5:44

GM Chuck Fletcher is playing a potentially dangerous game with his goaltending situation heading into 2021-22.
 After posting the NHL’s worst save percentage (.880) and allowing the most goals in the league a season ago, the Flyers are once again leaving their goaltending situation to chance in 2021-22.
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher has worked hard this offseason to try and improve his roster — adding defensemen Ryan Ellis and Rasmus Ristolainen via the trade market and dumped the offensive-minded Shayne Gostisbehere for cap space. Heck, he even swapped out a major defensive liability at forward in Jakub Voracek for the more defensively responsible Cam Atkinson. 
But while Fletcher took care of items off his offseason checklist, one of — if n…</span>

In which we get the good and the bad from a Blue Jackets expert. 
 When Jake Voracek was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Cam Atkinson the reaction of most Flyers fans was one of overwhelming positivity. But are we right to be so optimistic about the addition of Atkinson? Are there downsides to be found? We get the ins and the outs, the goods and the bads, from Alex Connor of The Cannon.</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Full disclosure: stole that headline from a Charles O’Connor tweet. Because it would appear that, at least for now, Chuck Fletcher is all done. 
Based on Fletcher&#x27;s availability today, it really does sound like the Flyers are done for now. 
Next is re-upping Hart &amp; Sanheim. After that, sounds like they&#x27;ll reassess their cap, and see if they can do (or have to do) anything else. But this very well could be &quot;pencils down.&quot;
— Charlie O&#x27;Connor (@charlieo_conn) July 28, 2021



*Anyhoo, it was a wild, wild day around the league yesterday, and while the Flyers didn’t do anything extra spicy, the did make some moves. They: 
Brought in Martin Jones to backup Carter Hart. [BSH]
Gave out another contract to... Nate Thompson. For some reason. [BSH]
Made the Keith Yandle deal we’d all heard about officially official. [Flyers]
And then added some AHL/press box depth in the form of Adam Clendening... [BSH]
... and defenseman Nick Seeler. [BSH]
*Speaking of Yandle, Charlie broke down what his impact to the team might be ahead of today’s frenzy. [The Athletic]
*Brian Elliott landed himself in Tampa Bay. Really glad he ended up in a good spot. Best of luck, BAMF. [Raw Charge]
*Around the Metro, the Hurricanes signed Tony DeAngelo. Big yikes. [Canes Country]
*The Devils signed Dougie Hamilton. Even bigger yikes, but a different kind of yikes! [All About The Jersey]
*And finally, as we said, it was a busy kick-off to free agency season. Here’s a handy rundown of every single thing that happened, in case you missed anything. [Sportsnet]</span>

Final Fantasy 14 instantly makes new players shout ‘I need that’ at their monitor
 Starting a new MMO is one of the most daunting things a video game player can do. Games like Final Fantasy 14 have massive, sprawling worlds filled with hundreds of hours worth of quests and more systems than 10 AAA games put together. So shepherding a player through their first 10 hours and reminding them that this game is worth their time is key to a good experience. 
But nothing incentivizes a player to stick with an MMO than seeing all the cool shit you can unlock as you level up, and nothing does that quite as well as Final Fantasy 14.
Like many, I’m a longtime World of Warcraft player who finally decided to give Final Fantasy 14 an honest shot. I started making the jump to F…</span>

The ‘first and only expansion’ for Outer Wilds
 Mobius Digital’s time-looping adventure game Outer Wilds — Polygon’s Game of the Year for 2019, by the way — is getting an expansion. It’s called Echoes of the Eye, and it’s coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox One on Sept. 28.
Echoes of the Eye will “weave directly into the existing world and narrative” of Outer Wilds, said Mobius Digital creative director Alex Beachum. “If you played the game you might be wondering ‘How? And also why?’ And those are very good questions,” Beachum added.
Announced during publisher Annapurna Interactive’s showcase on Thursday, Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye is ... well, like the main game, maybe it’s better if you don’t know too much going into it? That seems to be the developer’s approach to Outer Wilds’ new content, but here’s the official description of what players can expect:
The hearthian space program has detected an anomaly that canʼt be attributed to any known location in the solar system. Grab your flashlight and prepare to illuminate the darkest secrets of the Outer Wilds... 

Beachum calls Echoes of the Eye the “first and only expansion” for Outer Wilds. Watch its “willfully cryptic trailer” above.
The original Outer Wilds is coming to Nintendo Switch this holiday.</span>

An ode to jank
 One of my favorite games this summer is Necromunda: Hired Gun, which is a thrill ride of violence, guts, and gore in the grim darkness of the far future. The game is extremely fun, but also ... kind of sloppy. It isn’t quite broken, but it doesn’t fully work, either. 
In a word, it’s janky — and that’s part of why I love it so much. On one hand, jank breaks immersion and reminds us we’re playing a game, but on the other hand, it’s fun and often endearing. I’m not afraid to say it: I love these awkward baby horse games, and their stumbles only make them more endearing.
“Jank” is when the illusion of a world rips, and you can see the machinery underneath making the game work. Jank can manifest in silly looking animations…</span>

Knock things over, claw up furniture, solve puzzles, and lick your own butt
 A new trailer for Stray, the futuristic cyberpunk adventure game in which you’ll control a cat, offers our best look yet at developer BlueTwelve Studio’s game. The cat-centric gameplay looks impressively authentic; as the titular stray cat, you’ll knock things over to solve puzzles and create new pathways, leap through a strange city with feline grace, and claw up furniture because you despise humans’ material investments.
Most of what you’ll do in Stray draws upon the real-world abilities of a cat. But you also have a helpful companion, a drone named B-12, who offers other gifts. B-12 will helpfully interact with objects in the world and communicate with the city’s robotic inhabitants. The cat will also have to avoid danger from rat-like creatures, but with the help of B-12, it appears the cat can turn the tables and kill them en masse with a purple light.
The cat can also very believably lick its butt, as seen in the GIF below.
Stray is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC sometime in early 2022.</span>

Stylized action-platformer is coming to PC, PS4, and PS5
 Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine will release its next game, the 3D action-platformer Solar Ash, on Oct. 26, publisher Annapurna Interactive announced Thursday. Solar Ash is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.
Heart Machine first revealed Solar Ash in 2019 (as Solar Ash Kingdom). Players take on the role of Rei, a Voidrunner who will journey through a colorful, stylized world as she fights to save her planet from the Ultravoid. The developer promises fluid controls, with rail-grinding, grappling, and cloud surfing. 
“Solar Ash is Heart Machine’s vision of the adventure platformer,” game designer Alx Preston said of Solar Ash earlier this year. “The giant spaces, the feel of movement, the flow of combat, and the high stakes battles atop enormous beasts all come together to bring players something we think is incredibly unique, and more importantly, fun.”
In our review of the developer’s Hyper Light Drifter, we praised the top-down action game for its combination of story and gameplay: “It replaces traditional narrative structures with moods, but punctuates those contemplative, quiet moments with constant scenes of breakneck, pitch-perfect action. Getting those two elements to not only coexist but thrive together is a needle that Hyper Light Drifter confidently threads.”</span>

It also answers the question ‘What if Link had a gun?’
 Watch out Ganon! You have a new hero sneaking up your way! Thanks to a mod created by AaronTheSnob, you can now play The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker as Solid Snake, the protagonist of the Metal Gear series. 
The “Snake” in the mod is done in the style of Wind Waker, so he has big eyes and cute, stubby legs. (The little sausage legs just dangle in the wind as he parachutes down.) He wears his hair up with his recognizable headband and dons the dual-toned tactical espionage suit Snake is known for.

A difficult game with a generous ramp
 A simple screenshot of Death’s Door evokes its Dark Souls influence without you even needing to know it’s the follow-up to Acid Nerve’s previous top-down boss-killer, Titan Souls. Death’s Door captures that FromSoftware gloom in an instant, but it’s a far more forgiving experience than its inspiration.
Where Soulsborne games build seemingly impossible walls for you to break down from the start, Death’s Door carefully ramps up its difficulty to create a fair and completable experience. It’s still a challenge, but Death’s Door reduces the likelihood you’ll hit an impassable wall by slowly pushing your boundaries.
What is Death’s Door?

Check out War for Wakanda in action
 Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is a new expansion coming later this year that will star Black Panther and add the Wakanda biome. Square Enix gave fans a fresh look at the expansion during its E3 2021 livestream on Sunday. 
Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics first announced the War for Wakanda expansion in March of this year. The original trailer was a call to cation from Klaw, the infamous Vibranium thief played by Andy Serkis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Klaw and his minions will invade Wakanda in the new expansion, and the Avengers will team up with the Black Panther to help him save his kingdom.
Black Panther marks the third new hero since Marvel’s Avengers launched last year. Both Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — two different versions of the same hero, Hawkeye — have already made their debut. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics previously revealed that Spider-Man will come to Marvel’s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive hero.
Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda will be free for all players who own Marvel’s Avengers, and it will come to Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. 
Update (July 29): Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics revealed that Black Panther and Marvel’s Avengers War for Wakanda expansion will launch Aug. 17.</span>

Own the game? You won’t lose it.
 Forza Motorsport 7 is a relatively young game, having only been released in 2017. Today, Microsoft announced that the game is about to reach “End of Life” status, which means it’ll be unavailable to purchase on the Microsoft Store or through Xbox Game Pass after Sept. 15. Players who already own the game will be able to download and play the game as normal, including multiplayer and other online services. Microsoft will also continue to run Rivals esports events with partners.
Players who own DLC for the game but access the main game through Xbox Game Pass will not be locked out of the game either. Microsoft explains how these cases will be handled. The post reads, in part:
For any Xbox Game Pass players who previously purchased DLC for the game, but not the game itself, we have good news! You will receive a token for the game through the Xbox Message Center so that you can continue playing Forza Motorsport 7. Token distribution will be through August 2. However, if after that date you have not received your token, please contact Xbox Support here. (Unused tokens will expire on September 15, 2023.)
If you know someone who has yet to play Forza Motorsport 7, we are offering a discount on the game in the Microsoft Store through September 15.
The next game in the series, which is simply called Forza Motorsport, currently has no release date, although it will come to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</span>

                    <span>Using dozens of bot accounts, The Wall Street Journal did an investigation and determined that TikTok’s algorithm needs only one piece of information to determine what you want to watch: the amount of time you spend watching individual videos. Observing your watch time and rewatching is enough for them to fill your “For You” page with recommended videos that are right in your wheelhouse after just an hour or two. That this happens so quickly and completely — 90-95% of what users see on TikTok is algorithmically determined — leads to users going down narrow-interest rabbit holes that can be dangerous, e.g. if someone’s Covid interest turns into anti-vax QAnon crap or sadness turns into video after video about depression or harming yourself.
As someone who built an entire web app that collected people’s social media likes/faves, this focus on a single signal is fascinating. API limitations and rate limits on the number of requests would keep you from building a service with a TikTok-like algorithm for Twitter or Instagram that used likes as the only signal for whether to show someone a piece of content or not, but if you could, I bet it would be amazing.

                    <span>Yesterday, world champion gymnast Simone Biles removed herself from the women’s team final at the Olympics after not doing one of the planned two-and-a-half twists on her vault and stumbling on the landing. Biles said after the final:
I just felt like it would be a little bit better to take a back seat, work on my mindfulness. I didn’t want to risk the team a medal for, kind of, my screw ups, because they’ve worked way too hard for that.


On Twitter, former gymnast and diver Catherine Burns explained that Biles was likely experiencing a case of “the dreaded twisties”.

                    <span>Charles Gaba has been graphing the Covid-19 vaccination rates of the 50 states (and DC) against the percentage of people who voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and there is unsurprisingly a clear correlation between the two:

As one commenter noted, all of the solidly “blue” states are above the vaxxed national average and all the solidly “red” states are below it. The picture is a little more muddy when you look at the rates at the county level:

The “conservatives are unvaxxed” trend is still there, but a lack of access and education around the vaccines in counties with large Black and Latino populations also plays a large role in whether people are vaccinated or not.

                    <span>As I’ve written before, in the history of astronomy and astrophysics, women have made major discoveries and played a significant role in advancing our understanding of the universe but have often not gotten the recognition their male peers enjoy. In 1967, while she was working on her doctoral research with her advisor Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell Burnell (then Jocelyn Bell) discovered a new and unusual kind of object, the pulsar. In this short documentary, Bell Burnell shares her story — how she got interested in radio astronomy, the prejudice with which she was treated as the only woman in her university program, how she discovered the first pulsar and persisted (more than once) through Hewish’s assertions that the object was “interference”, and how she was passed over for the Nobel Prize for her discovery.
In 2018, Bell Burnell was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics “for fundamental contributions to the discovery of pulsars, and a lifetime of inspiring leadership in the scientific community”, joining past honorees like the LIGO team, Stephen Hawking, and the team that discovered the Higgs boson. She donated the entire $3 million prize to the Institute of Physics to help support “PhD physics students from under-represented groups” with their educations.
It’s not justice, but I will note that Bell Burnell’s Wikipedia page is longer and more substantial than Hewish’s, despite his Nobel.

                    <span>There are some major improvements to Siri in iOS 15, with Apple introducing features that iPhone users have long asked for. On devices with an A12 chip or later, ‌Siri‌ can do on-device processing and there&#x27;s support for offline requests.





This guide highlights all of the new ‌Siri‌ features that are available in iOS (and iPadOS) 15.



On-Device Speech Processing and Personalization


Starting in ‌iOS 15‌, speech processing and personalization are done on-device. This makes ‌Siri‌ faster at processing requests, but also more secure. Most audio requests made of ‌Siri‌ are kept entirely on the ‌iPhone‌ and are no longer uploaded to Apple&#x27;s servers for processing.

                    <span>Customers who visit U.S. Apple Stores will once again be required to wear masks at most retail locations, reports Bloomberg.





Apple dropped its mask requirement for vaccinated customers and employees back in June, but earlier this month, Apple began requiring employees in select regions to wear masks and encouraged other employees to do so.



Now both customers and employees in areas where the COVID-19 virus is prevalent will need to wear masks when inside an Apple retail location, and this also pertains to those who are vaccinated. Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.



Apple informed employees about the change in a memo:
&quot;After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they&#x27;re vaccinated.&quot; The company added it is making the change &quot;out of an abundance of caution.&quot;
In addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. &quot;Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it,&quot; reads Apple&#x27;s memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.



Apple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices until October at least. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Nintendo today announced that it is sunsetting Dr. Mario World for iOS, a game that launched just two years ago. According to Nintendo, service for Dr. Mario World is set to end on Monday, November 1.





As of today, diamonds, the game&#x27;s in-app currency, are no longer available for purchase. Starting on November 1, Nintendo says an end-of-service notification will be displayed and the game will not be playable.






Players will be able to look back at their player history in &quot;Dr. Mario World Memories,&quot; a web page that Nintendo plans to launch later this year. This website will use player history, and customers can avoid being included by deleting their save data in the app.



Dr. Mario World is a puzzle game based on the well-known Dr. Mario Nintendo title. Players are tasked with matching capsules with viruses in order to clear out all the viruses on the board, and Nintendo characters like Peach, Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba appear in the game.



Like Nintendo&#x27;s other titles, Dr. Mario World is a free-to-play game that included optional in-app purchases, but apparently the game failed to catch on.



Bloomberg last year said that Nintendo is &quot;retreating&quot; from its mobile game plans, focusing on already-released titles rather than debuting new games. Nintendo has had success with games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, but has not been able to maintain sales momentum.



Nintendo previously discontinued Miitomo, Pokémon Duel, and Pokémon Rumble Rush. Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost, Super Mario Run, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, and Mario Kart Tour continue to be available.

                    <span>Since AirTags were just released earlier this year and are expected to have a year-long battery life, it may be some time yet before AirTag users need a replacement battery, but when the time comes for a refresh, Apple is warning customers not to buy batteries with a bitter coating.





‌AirTags‌ use coin-shaped CR2032 batteries, which happen to be a size that&#x27;s easy to swallow. Some battery makers like Duracell have begun putting a bitter coating on CR2032 batteries to prevent children from eating them.



According to Duracell, hundreds of lithium coin batteries are accidentally swallowed by children each year, and these batteries can cause a harmful chemical reaction. The non-toxic bitter coating reacts with saliva and is meant to deter swallowing.

                    <span>Apple has not decided whether or not it will require vaccines for corporate employees that return to work this October, according to CNBC&#x27;s Josh Lipton.





Cook reportedly told Lipton that Apple is primarily focusing on when to have employees return, but the company is &quot;monitoring things daily&quot; to determine whether a vaccination requirement &quot;is the right answer or not.&quot;




.@tim_cook spoke w/ me yesterday about this same issue at @Apple:

                    <span>Apple today seeded the third public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The third beta comes two weeks after Apple released the second macOS Monterey public beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Apple chip supplier TSMC is planning to manufacture chips with a 2nm fabrication process by 2024, according to Nikkei Asia.





TSMC plans to build a new factory on 50 acres of land for two-nanometer chips in Hsinchu, Taiwan, scheduled to begin manufacturing operations in 2024. Construction has been cleared to begin in early 2022, with equipment being installed in 2023.



For context, if Apple continues with its current naming system for its custom silicon chips, we may tentatively expect the first 2nm Apple chips to be the &quot;A18&quot; or the &quot;M5.&quot; While there have not been any reports of Apple planning to move to a 2nm process yet, it seems inevitable that the company will do so in tandem with TSMC since it is Apple&#x27;s sole processor supplier with an expansive manufacturing capacity.



TSMC&#x27;s manufacturing capabilities are also considerably more advanced than rival companies like Intel, which have been mired by delays and stagnation with older manufacturing processes, enabling Apple, as a major TSMC client, to maintain a competitive edge with its custom silicon chips. Earlier this week, Intel announced plans to make chips for Qualcomm.



The A14 and M1 chip debuted in devices last year and were Apple&#x27;s first chips to be manufactured with a 5nm fabrication process. Apple is believed to have already booked an order with TSMC for 4nm custom silicon chips, which are due to begin production this year, ahead of the supplier offering 3nm chips from 2022. 2nm chips in 2024 would be another progression of this miniaturization process.



TSMC is undergoing a rapid global expansion to meet demand, building a 5nm chip facility in Arizona and expanding its 28nm factory in Nanjing, China, while also weighing up the possibility of opening new factories in Japan and Germany.

“Yes, I’m vaccinated,” says NBA legend Charles Barkley. “Everybody

“The only people who are not vaccinated are just assholes,”
he says.
The 58-year-old NBA Hall-of-Famer says he personally thinks sports
leagues should force players to get vaccinated. “Can you imagine
if one of these guys that are not vaccinated, if they get one of
these players’ kids, wives, girlfriends, moms and dads sick and
they die over some unnecessary conspiracy bullshit,” Barkley says.
“I think that would be tragic.”

Techdirt is one of the very, very, very few truly independent media brands around. Almost none of the independent media brands that existed when we started remain. Some have been sucked up into larger companies or shut down entirely. Others have decided to go behind expensive paywalls. We’ve had to adapt and change over the years in many ways just to stick around, but in the end the reason we do this is because of the community we’ve built up here. For us to stick around, I need to ask the community to help support us as well. We have some cool experiments and projects in the works, so stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, if you can help us out, it would be hugely appreciated.
Techdirt is irreplaceable. There’s no other site like it. And indeed, indie websites that neither run crappy ads nor put their content behind a paywall are a dying breed. You go to an article at Techdirt and you see the article. No annoying popovers begging you to subscribe to a newsletter. You just see the article.

Chuck Fletcher adds a depth defenseman, formerly of the Wild.
 On what has been an incredibly busy day across the NHL, the Flyers evidently aren’t done yet. 




According to the Athletic’s Michael Russo, the Flyers are about to sign a defenseman that Chuck Fletcher will know quite a bit about. 
Per sources, #Flyers are signing physical, mobile former #mnwild and #gophers defenseman Nick Seeler.
One-year, two-way, $750K AAV, $300K minor, $350K guaranteed
— Michael Russo (@RussoHockey) July 28, 2021



Nick Seeler, 28, was drafted in 2011 by the Minnesota Wild (5th round, 131 overall). At 6’2”, 201 lbs, he has a solid frame for a quality NHL defenseman, but after finishing his NCAA career with Nebraska, he took an NCAA transfer year, spending 2015-16 with the University of Minnesota before turning professional. Since then, he’s spent roughly half of his career in the AHL and half in the NHL, with his longest NHL stint being 71 games in 2018-19, where he scored 7 points.
He was eventually waived by Minnesota in 2019-20 and was claimed by Chicago. However, in January of 2021 his contract was terminated after he was waived again. 
Seeler will likely spend most of his time in the AHL, though if needed he could step in at the NHL level, though he has never been particularly effective nor passible.</span>

Chuck Fletcher adds another depth piece.
 Continuing a very busy, yet simultaneously quiet free agency for the Flyers, the Orange &amp; Black have signed former New York Ranger Adam Clendening to a one year, two-way deal, and if the other two-way deals signed today are any indication, his NHL salary will be something in the $700-$750k range. With a few older players on the back end, it’s never a bad idea to have injury insurance, and Clendening can fulfill that role while also being a solid AHL player. At just 28 years old and coming on a flexible deal, this isn’t a bad deal for the Flyers by any means, and if Clendening is the 7th defender for the team in the 2020-21 season he’ll at the very least be an upgrade over Nate Prosser.
Clendening hasn’t played an NHL game since the 2018-19 postseason with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but he’s been productive in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, posting 82 points in 109 games. Clendening was also a solid NHL defender for a three year stretch earlier in his career, having his best season under Alain Vigneault in New York. If the Flyers were seeking a mentor for Yegor Zamula and Cam York while they get some seasoning in Lehigh Valley, they could have done far worse. 
Philadelphia now has just above $8 million in cap space to work with, so barring any trades it’s difficult to see them making any further signings. Stay tuned in case there’s more to come.</span>

A familiar face returns to Philadelphia.
 The Flyers have brought back a name from the 2019-20 season in Nate Thompson to solidify their forward depth. The Alaska native played 23 games in the Orange &amp; Black, including 16 postseason games, prior to his departure in the 2020-21 free agency period for the Winnipeg Jets. He returns on a one year, $800K AAV deal coming off of a season where he played 52 games (eight playoff games) and totaled two goals and five assists with the Jets.
Thompson was a decent enough defensive forward last year, grading out with a strong positive effect by RAPM xGA/60, but his negligible offensive impact, age (36, turns 37 in October), and overall lack of upside makes him a low-impact signing that arguably hurts the team by absorbing further salary space and potentially blocking Morgan Frost or Tanner Laczynski from becoming roster mainstays.
With this, Philadelphia and GM Chuck Fletcher now have just over $8 million in projected cap space (via Capfriendly.com) to work with. There may be more to come. Stay tuned.</span>

Well, there’s your backup goalie.
 After a historically awful season by their goaltending tandem in 2020-21, the Flyers had a clear need at the backup position for a netminder who could help shoulder the load if Carter Hart’s struggles continued. Chuck Fletcher appears to have found his guy in former San Jose Sharks goaltender Martin Jones, signing him to a one year, $2 million AAV contract Wednesday.
Jones was bought out by the Sharks on Tuesday, concluding his time in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old goalie had a successful early career with Team Teal, often coming up big on breakaway stops, but after posting a spectacular Stanley Cup Playoffs performance in 2015-16 and a receiving a new contract (six years at $5.75 million AAV with a modified no-trade clause), he swiftly fell from grace.
Since the 2018-19 season, Jones has graded out amongst the worst starting goalies in the league by GSAx, posting awful numbers each year. Jones was the 6th worst goaltender in the league by this metric in 2020-21, only ahead of guys like Matt Murray and... Carter Hart. The 6’4” goalkeeper has posted an “impressive” three consecutive seasons with an .896 save percentage, which even behind a shaky San Jose team is frightening. The Flyers are likely betting that in a reduced role, Jones will improve, and it’s worth noting that he’ll at the very least be capable of carrying a heavy load of starts; he’s started over 50% of the Shark’s games for each since 2015-16.

 The Flyers traded for Rasmus Ristolainen. They traded a whole lot for him. The whole internet will tell you he’s bad. And maybe he is! But maybe he... isn’t? Joe Yerdon, the guy who knows the Buffalo Sabres better than anyone, gives us the inside scoop on just who we got here.</span>

Will more of the squad join the game too?
 Bloodsport is coming to Fortnite. The Suicide Squad sharpshooter’s appearance in the game was announced on Wednesday by Bloodsport himself, actor Idris Elba. The Suicide Squad director James Gunn originally tweeted a video about the crossover.
In the video, we get a brief glimpse of Bloodsport wreaking havoc on the Fortnite island, taking ziplines, and firing off rocket launchers — which certainly seems to fit his vibe from the trailers. According to Elba, Bloodsport is coming to the island soon; the video ends with a tease saying that we’ll get more information about The Suicide Squad’s tie-in with Fortnite sometime on Thursday. 
Oh yeah. #Fortnite fans prepare to get some dubs. @FortniteGame @idriselba pic.twitter.com/rlNQP0tk1l
— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) July 28, 2021



This isn’t the first time that DC Comics heroes have made their way to the island. Batman and his rogues’ gallery have shown up in the past, along with a few other DC heroes and villains. Hopefully this new Suicide Squad event will include a few more of the upcoming movie’s characters as well. 
This story will be updated when Epic and Warner Bros. reveal more about the collaboration on Thursday. The Suicide Squad will be released in theaters and on HBO Max on Aug. 6.</span>

It’s a start
 Fans don’t like the teeny, tiny font in the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, but that’s not stopping them from fixing it.
On Wednesday Square Enix released the Pixel Remasters of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 2, and Final Fantasy 3 on Android, iOS, and Windows PC. The games include updates like a refreshed look and a newly remastered soundtrack. While many of the changes brought a much-needed face-lift to an old franchise, not all of them were welcome. Namely, people took issue with the font, and now they’re finding crafty ways to fix it.
It started back in late June, when Square Enix first posted screenshots of the remasters. Upon seeing the screenshots, fans immediately scrutinized and criticized the font. Many fans were upset that it was small and complained that it would be hard to read, presenting a possible accessibility issue that could make it difficult for some people to play. The new font also doesn’t preserve the pixelated look of the original games, and it generally looked out of place in a remaster of a retro title. A few fans even made memes to make fun of it. 
Some held out hope that Square Enix would respond before the release in July and fix the font. But then the game came out on Wednesday with the same old font, and fans expressed their disappointment. 
As it turns out, it’ll be relatively easy for fans to change the font — at least in the PC version. As a post from RPG Site points out, the Japanese-language version of the games actually has an English font that’s better than the one that comes with the English version. To fix it, you don’t have to download anything special. It’s just a matter of copying and pasting the files into the right place on your computer.
Polygon reached out to Square Enix for comment, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article as we hear from them.</span>

                    <span>Available in the Item Store on Thursday
 The 1963 Aston Martin DB5 — the most recognizable of all the James Bond cars — crosses over to Rocket League beginning July 29.
Thanks to a deal with MGM (and, one assumes, the carmaker, too), players can get the star of 1964’s Goldfinger for 1,100 Credits from the Item Store on Thursday. Psyonix said in a news release that more of James Bond’s vehicle fleet will be made available later this year. This is all presumably a tie-in with No Time to Die, the latest Bond flick, which was originally due to premiere in 2020 but was delayed repeatedly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film, Daniel Craig’s last as Bond, will be released Sept. 30.
In Rocket League, the Aston Martin DB5 uses the Octane hitbox. It does not come equipped with pop-out machine guns, a rotating license plate, a rear-window bullet shield, or an ejection seat. But it does have a rocket boost, and it drives around with the real DB5’s signature engine note.
The car is part of a bundle that includes 007’s Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, although they can only be equipped on this car. Buyers also get the Reel Life Decal.
Rocket League last crossed over with Hollywood in June with a three-car Fast &amp; Furious bundle, each of which also offered a Reel Life Decal.</span>

Battlefield is built well for competition, and Portal’s opposing approach is something to celebrate
 Battlefield Portal is a new game mode in Battlefield 2042 that lets players mash up their favorite Battlefield time periods into a single game. An army of World War II soldiers against a handful of 2042 grunts; one tank against 100 tiny robots. It’s very ... FPS by way of Looney Tunes. Seemingly taking inspiration from Halo Forge, custom map creators, and other level editors, the mode promises something rare for the 20-year-old franchise: comedy.
But don’t expect Battlefield 2042’s Portal mode to be balanced for competitive play. Its focus is fun — the kind you can’t help but clip and share with friends.
What is Battlefield Portal?

This weekend’s preview is all about bots and education
 Players are just a day away from testing Halo Infinite’s multiplayer themselves, 343 Industries revealed on Twitter. From July 29 to Aug. 1, a group of select players will get the chance to engage in some arena-based combat. The studio will reveal more details and show off some of the preview via its Twitch and YouTube channels this Thursday.
This technical preview doesn’t appear to include any actual PvP, and will instead focus on Arena games featuring four human players against four AI bots in the game’s classic Slayer mode. Players will also be able to test three arenas, some academy weapon drills — which act as individual weapon tutorials — and various menu performance. 343 promises…</span>
