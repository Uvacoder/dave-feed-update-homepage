                    <span>macOS Big Sur 11.4, which was released this morning, addresses a zero-day vulnerability that could allow attackers to piggyback off of apps like Zoom, taking secret screenshots and surrepetiously recording the screen.





Jamf, a mobile device management company, today highlighted a security issue that allowed Privacy preferences to be bypassed, providing an attacker with Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, and other permissions without a user&#x27;s consent.



The bypass was actively exploited in the wild, and was discovered by Jamf when analyzing XCSSET malware. The XCSSET malware has been out in the wild since 2020, but Jamf noticed an uptick in recent activity and discovered a new variant.



Once installed on a victim&#x27;s system, the malware was used specifically for taking screenshots of the user&#x27;s desktop with no additional permissions required. Jamf said that it could be used to bypass other permissions as well, as long as the donor application the malware piggybacked off of had that permission enabled.



Jamf has a full rundown on how the exploit worked, and the company says that Apple addressed the vulnerability in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.4, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that a fix has indeed been enabled in macOS 11.4, so Mac users should update their software as soon as possible.

                    <span>This is a photo of a tiny tiny snippet of the universe, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Every object you see in the photo is a staggeringly massive galaxy that contains hundreds of billions of stars along with all sort of other things.
Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is well over one hundred thousand light years across. We only see a pitiful portion of it. Although it contains several hundred billion stars in its expanse, we can only see a fraction of a fraction of them.
And even that doesn’t fully capture the essence of a galaxy, which also has planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and more. Galaxies are colossal objects, their true nature only becoming apparent to us a century ago.


I know I’ve posted photos like this before, but every time I see something like this, my mind boggles anew at the sheer scale and magnitude of it all and I just have to share it.
P.S. And Earth contains the only sentient life in the entire universe? Lol.

                    <span>Using data from the United States Geological Survey, River Runner visualizes the path taken by a raindrop from its landing spot to its eventual endpoint. Just click on any spot in the US and it maps out the path the drop would take, complete with a satellite fly-through of the route. I spent many happy minutes playing with this, although the endpoint of “Canada” for a raindrop that lands in my Vermont yard was somewhat unsatisfying.

                    <span>Translating sites, search engines, social networks, browsers, ISPs, and other internet entities into geographic features, Martin Vargic has created a map of the internet circa 2021.
It includes several thousand of some of the most popular websites, represented as distinct “countries”, which are grouped together with others of similar type or category, forming dozens of distinct clusters, regions and continents that stretch throughout the map, such as “news sites”, “search engines”, “social networks”, “e-commerce”, “adult entertainment”, “file sharing”, “software companies” and so much more.  In the center of it all can be found ISPs and web browsers, which form the core and backbone of the internet as we know it, while the far south is the domain of the mysterious “dark web”.

                    <span>The three week Epic Games v. Apple trial wrapped up today, with a series of debates that were held in lieu of traditional closing arguments. The wrap up follows Apple CEO Tim Cook&#x27;s testimony last week, which saw him grilled by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Apple&#x27;s App Store policies.





As outlined by Protocol, at the conclusion of the trial, Rogers aimed to get at the heart of the dispute and determine what remedies might ultimately be appropriate.



As she did earlier in the trial, Rogers hinted that she may be leaning toward something of a compromise with a ruling that would see Apple required to allow apps like Fortnite to direct users to make purchases on the web rather than in apps, something that&#x27;s currently forbidden by the ‌App Store‌ rules.

                    <span>New MacBook Pro models are coming at WWDC, according to leaker Jon Prosser who has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple&#x27;s plans.





Prosser provided no additional information, but there are new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the works. The new MacBook Pros will feature the most radical redesign to the MacBook Pro lineup since 2016.



Apple is planning to reintroduce the MagSafe port, and the 2021 MacBook Pro models will feature an HDMI port and an SD card reader in addition to a trio of Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, and multiple color options are a possibility. 



There will be no Touch Bar included, with Apple returning to a traditional row of function keys, and there will be a redesigned thermal system to accommodate the upgraded Apple silicon chips that the machines are expected to include.



Bloomberg recently said that the new MacBook Pro models will feature 10-core Apple silicon chips with eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, along with 16 or 32-core GPU options and support for up to 64GB RAM.



No other sources have indicated that the MacBook Pro models will be coming at WWDC, and it has been atypical for Apple to debut hardware at the event in recent years, but it is not unheard of. The new MacBook Pro models are expected to enter production in the second half of 2021, and reliable sources that include Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have suggested a launch in the second half of the year.

                    <span>Apple last Friday released the first M1 iMac models to customers and began selling them in stores, and iFixit has now started one of its traditional teardowns on the new machines.





iFixit is tearing down the mid-tier purple ‌iMac‌ model with an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and 8GB RAM. It&#x27;s worth noting that the internals of this model will look different than the internals of the base model with a 7-core GPU as the two machines have different cooling systems.



The base ‌iMac‌ has a single cooling fan and a heat sink while the higher-end 8-core GPU models have two fans and a heat pipe along with heat sinks, so expect the internals to look different if you have a 7-core GPU ‌iMac‌.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.6 and iPadOS 14.6 to the public. The iOS 14.6 update isn&#x27;t quite as significant as the iOS 14.5 update that preceded it, but it still introduces a number of notable new features. We&#x27;ve highlighted everything that&#x27;s new in iOS and iPadOS 14.6 below.





Apple Music Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio Support


Apple in May introduced two new Apple Music features, which ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are getting for no additional cost. ‌Apple Music‌ Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos will offer up an immersive, multi-dimensional audio experience that lets artists mix music in a way that makes it sound like the notes are coming from all around you.





Apple is also upgrading its entire music catalog to Lossless Audio, which preserves the details in the origina…</span>

                    <span>Apple alongside the second-generation Apple TV 4K debuted a redesigned version of the Siri Remote, which is now available to customers with new ‌Apple TV‌ orders and as a $60 standalone replacement for the original ‌Siri‌ Remote.

We picked up the updated ‌Siri‌ Remote to see if it&#x27;s worth picking up if you have an original ‌Apple TV‌ 4K or HD and are tired of the first iteration of the remote, which has several shortcomings.



Apple entirely overhauled the ‌Siri‌ Remote&#x27;s design. It has an all-aluminum body that does away with the touchpad interface, instead adopting a touch-based clickpad and several additional buttons for control purposes.

                    <span>Following its announcement last month, Apple today officially flipped the switch to allow parents to share their Apple Card with their teenagers or friends and the ability for spouses to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌ account. However, one notable feature that didn&#x27;t get released today is the ability for two separate ‌Apple Card‌ accounts to be merged into one.





Apple announced the feature last month but didn&#x27;t specifically pin a release date. Now, in a new support document, Apple says that starting later on in July, users will be able to merge two existing ‌Apple Card‌ accounts into one, and in doing so, be able to combine their credit limits. 

Coming July 2021: You will be able to invite another ‌Apple Card‌ owner to combine credit limits and form one co-owned account.1
The ability to share an ‌Apple Card‌ with iCloud Family members above 13 years old and the ability to co-own an ‌Apple Card‌ were released today as part of the iOS 14.6 update.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.6, with it bringing support for Apple Podcasts subscriptions and new support for Apple Card Family. Announced last month, ‌Apple Card‌ Family allows families to share a single ‌Apple Card‌ with users above 13 years old with the ability to set a spending limit.





Following its release, Apple has shared two how-to videos on how exactly to share an Apple Card with your teenager or friend and how to co-own a single Apple Card with your significant other. The process for sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with a friend or teenager is enabled within the Wallet app on iOS 14.6 or later and requires that you be in an iCloud Family with the person you wish to share the card with.  








Last month, Apple also announced the ability for couples to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌, allowing them to build their credit score together. The process is similar to sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with your teenager or friend but requires you to share your spouse&#x27;s annual income. 








‌Apple Card‌ Family is available today with the iOS 14.6 update.

tvOS 14.6, which is a free update, can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the Apple TV by going to System &gt; Software Update. ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates enabled will be upgraded to tvOS 14.5 automatically.



tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing primarily on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than outward-facing changes. tvOS 14.6 lays the groundwork for the new Apple Music Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and Lossless Audio features.



Spatial Audio offers an immersive audio experience that makes it sound like music is coming from all around you, while Lossless Audio will provide higher-quality songs that sound exactly like they do when artists record them in the studio.



At launch in June, thousands of tracks will feature Spatial Audio support, and more than 20,000 songs will support Lossless Audio. By the end of the year, 75 million songs will support it.

                    <span>This past November, the Apple TV app made its debut on Xbox gaming consoles, now, the Apple TV app is gaining support for Dolby Vision on Xbox, offering viewers improved high dynamic range paired with Dolby Atmos for a truly cinematic experience.





Xbox says that to enable Dolby Vision for ‌Apple TV‌ on Xbox, users must first have a compatible TV that supports high dynamic range. With compatible TVs, users will find a new toggle under &quot;TV &amp; display options&quot; in their Xbox settings tab to enable Dolby Vision. Additionally, not all ‌Apple TV‌ content will initially support Dolby Vision. 

To start experiencing it with a Dolby Vision compatible TV, you need to have “Allow Dolby Vision” enabled and checked in Settings &gt; General &gt; TV &amp; display options &gt; Video Modes on your console. You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.
The ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices such as the PS4, and select smart TVs. This is part of Apple&#x27;s recent strategy to expand its services business to more customers.

                    <span>Anker today is introducing a new set of gallium nitride (GaN) USB-C chargers that offer fast charging speeds for mobile devices in a design that&#x27;s smaller than ever. The new Nano II line is available in 30W, 45W, and 65W versions, and Anker says it has improved the chips and internal layout of its chargers to deliver greater efficiency while generating less heat.





The 30-watt charger measures in at just 31.5 mm by 30.4 mm and about 38 mm deep. (The UK versions of all three chargers are about 1.5 mm deeper due to their prong design.) It can fast-charge an iPhone or iPad, and even fully support the latest MacBook Air.



The 45-watt version offers a bit more power to be able to charge a wider variety of notebooks and other gadgets, and it measures 37.7 mm by 35 mm by about 41 mm. It also features foldable prongs to make it less likely to be damaged or to damage other items when tossed in together.



The 65-watt version can fully power devices all the way up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it too features foldable prongs. The charger measures 41.7 mm by 36 mm by about 44 mm.



All three chargers are available for preorder on Amazon and Anker.com for US customers, priced at $29.99, $35.99, and $39.99 respectively. Versions for UK and EU customers will be available at a later date.

                    <span>Some users are noticing more blooming on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&#x27;s Liquid Retina XDR mini-LED display than expected, despite Apple&#x27;s claims that the effect is minimized.





According to recently published Apple Support documents, the ‌iPad Pro‌&#x27;s Liquid Retina XDR display is designed to improve on &quot;the trade-offs of typical local dimming systems, where the extreme brightness of LEDs might cause a slight blooming effect,&quot; suggesting that the effect should be minimized.

                    <span>Apple has filed the unreleased &quot;Beats Studio Buds&quot; in the FCC or Federal Communications Commission database under model numbers A2512 and A2513. The new filings come after the reveal of the new earbuds last week within the release candidates for iOS and tvOS 14.6.





The new earbuds feature a smaller design with no stem, much in line with what we&#x27;re expecting to be a similar design language for the second-generation AirPods Pro. In addition, according to code found within the latest iOS release candidate, the new Beats Studio Buds will feature Active Noise Cancellation, currently a feature exclusive to Apple&#x27;s ‌AirPods Pro‌ and AirPods Max. 





Today&#x27;s new FCC filings reveal nothing new about the design or the feature set of the upcoming earbuds; however, its filing indicates that a release should be imminent.

Launch the Settings app on your Apple TV.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select ClickPad.


Select Click and Touch to allow both clicking and touch surface tracking, or Click Only to turn off touch surface tracking.






Change Siri Remote Tracking Sensitivity



Launch the Settings app on your ‌Apple TV‌.


Select Remotes and Devices.


Select Touch Surface Tracking.


Select Fast to make smaller thumb movements move farther on the ‌Apple TV‌ screen, or Slow to reduce tracking sensitivity.






If you&#x27;re having trouble scrubbing through video when playback is paused, check our mini guide to make sure you&#x27;re using the correct clickpad gesture.

                    <span>Apple is intensely researching all aspects of car engineering and manufacturing, but there are growing questions around what form Apple&#x27;s vehicle project may take, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.





Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Peter Fintl, the director of technology and innovation for Capgemini Engineering Germany, explained that Apple&#x27;s movement in vehicle supply chains is noticeable.
We have seen enough echoes in the supply chain that we know Apple is really looking into every detail of car engineering and car manufacturing. But nobody knows if what Apple creates will be a car or a tech platform or a mobility service.
The report suggests that Apple&#x27;s car project may not actually culminate in a consumer-purchasable complete vehicle. Instead, Apple may …</span>

                    <span>Salvador Rodriguez, reporting for CNBC:
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on Friday said the social media company is
happy to pay Apple’s 30% commission rate on in-app transactions.
“We really feel like Snapchat wouldn’t exist without the iPhone
and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,” Spiegel
said on TechCheck. “In that sense, I’m not sure we have a choice
about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we’re happy to do it in
exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us
in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware
advancements.”
At first blush you might think this is lickspittle-ism. But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap.
But here’s thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. From Investopedia, citing Snap’s 10-K for 2020:
Substantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,
which accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in
revenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.
99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.
Find me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.

                    <span>I love this new ad from Apple. But given that I wrote this a few months ago, that’s probably not surprising. Funny, eye-opening, and true — that’s a good foundation for any ad.

This material was recorded at a secret gig in Amsterdam (back in 2016).

                    <span>I was talking to Jemma recently about what stops people
from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of
specific blog…</span>

Canada still haven’t won a game. 
 On the eve of day four of the IIHF World Championships, taking place in Riga, Latvia, the standings don’t look as many had predicted.
At the top of each group stands Russia in A and Germany in B, par for the course, especially considering the hockey talent Germany has produced in recent years. In particular, Lukas Reichel, a player we were personally high on, has stood out with five points in his first two games. 
However, Canada have not won a game yet (their goal differential sits at -6!) and the USA find themselves in 5th place at 1-1 with a +3 goal difference.

*The first round is going to be over fast; have you selected a bandwagon? A team from the Central Division, perhaps? [BSH]
*As more and more of these guys end up in the NHL, the one-stacked prospect corps will naturally thin out. Right now, who are the best of the bunch? [Inquirer]
*About those top prospects transitioning... Joel Farabee did that pretty nicely eh? We’re going to need him to get even better. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of getting better, we grade out this season’s bottom six forwards. [BSH]
*Kevin Hayes was playing injured this season. Which, frankly, seems obvious. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This weekend’s playoff action continued the excitement we’ve seen from this first round so far. Unfortunately, this weekend also brought us an incredibly scary moment for Leafs’ captain John Tavares. [Pension Plan Puppets]
*This weekend also brought a long suspension for Nazem Kadri. Which we are forced to compare to Tom Wilson. And then think about things. [Mile High Hockey]
*He’s appealing, though. [AP]
*And finally, another decision by the DoPS brings another round of calls for some kind of examination of the NHL’s discipline process. It just plain isn’t working. [The Athletic]</span>

How to start your journey, and where it is all headed
 Biomutant is a role-playing game where your experience tends to be differentiated more by character alignment rather than by their build of attributes and gear. The first two hours of Biomutant onboard the player to the world’s lore; its combat, crafting, and other systems; and then send them off on their first main mission. 
This Biomutant beginner’s guide will help you understand the game’s story, the ethos that informs the choices you have to make, and the initial choices themselves, so that you can shape your character and your story in a sensible way.

                    <span>Not quite Half-Life 3 confirmed, but it is to Victoria fans
 Victoria 3, a sequel so long-awaited by its fans the title has become a meme, is in development and coming soon. The grand strategy title was a keynote reveal of this weekend’s PDXCon, the annual gathering for all things Paradox Interactive.
Paradox’s Victoria series is a “society simulation” set in Great Britain during the time surrounding the industrial revolution. The most recent title was 2010’s Victoria 2 for PC. In the decade since, Victoria fans had beaten news or rumor of a sequel into a meme somewhat like the well-known Half-Life 3 meme. 
This weekend, the meme died. A Paradox Interactive community manager took to the official forums this weekend to start a meme contest for the game, posting this picture of game director Martin Anward (which Anward himself tweeted out on Friday.)

“Victoria 3 is instantly one of the most highly anticipated grand strategy games in Paradox’s history,” the company said in a statement, obliquely acknowledging its meme status. In the game, players take one of “dozens of nations,” not just the U.K., and lead it through a time of societal change, technological innovation, economic turmoil, and geopolitical rivalries.
Paradox’s news release did not say when Victoria 3 would launch, but did say it would be available for Windows PC via Steam, Xbox Game Pass for PC, and the Paradox Store.
As for the meme contest, I don’t know who won, but this was my personal favorite:

Final Fantasy Origin rumored for PS5, PC
 Nioh and Ninja Gaiden developer Team Ninja is developing a new Final Fantasy spinoff action game for Square Enix, according to a report from Fanbyte. That game, reportedly titled Final Fantasy Origin, is expected to be announced in June in conjunction with E3 2021. Square Enix is confirmed to appear at this year’s E3.
Fanbyte’s report follows a series of rumors regarding Final Fantasy Origin, which has been compared to FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The Final Fantasy spinoff is said to be “more accessible [than Nioh] for a wider audience” and set during the events of the first game in the franchise. Origin is reportedly bound for PlayStation 5, with a Windows PC version coming later.
Another component of the rumor surrounding Final Fantasy Origin is that Team Ninja will release a playable demo of the game this summer to solicit feedback from players. The studio similarly released “alpha” demos of Nioh and Nioh 2 ahead of each game’s final product.
Team Ninja and Square Enix already have a close working relationship, thanks to the former’s work on Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, a fighting game featuring characters plucked from the wider Final Fantasy franchise. That game features two characters based on the original Final Fantasy, the Warrior of Light (pictured above) and Garland.
Square Enix previously released a game under the name Final Fantasy Origins. Released for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy Origins compiled the first two games in the franchise in remastered form.</span>

There’s other stuff too, but the bear’s fun
 Crusader Kings 3’s first major expansion is coming soon, and it’s all about your seat of power. Royal Court allows medieval rulers to hang out in a 3D throne room, meet with their courtiers, and hire bards to sing epic tales. 
Royal Court fleshes out one of Crusader Kings 3’s most intriguing elements — managing your home base. Players have to deal with unruly vassals and rebellions, hold feasts, seduce lords, and ferret out secrets. Sometimes, the stories that take place in the player’s own royal hall are far more compelling than anything that happens over foreign borders.
Therefore, it makes sense that Royal Court turns your throne room into a much more tangible place that players can decorate, show off, and fill with fun entertainment like woodworkers or, uh, angry bears.
The Royal Court expansion will also introduce hybrid cultures and new ways for cultures to develop and diverge over the years, allowing rulers to make new ways of life for their kingdoms and empires. A previous, smaller scale expansion in March added winter weather and Norse invasions.
Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court will launch later in 2021.</span>

Raid charts are a universal language in Destiny, and key to taking on its hardest challenges
 Vault of Glass, the original Destiny raid, made its debut in Destiny 2 on Saturday. Bungie gave the old raid a new coat of paint, and many teams — including my own — dove in to conquer the challenge within the first 24 hours. But even though we all knew the fights from the original game, it didn’t stop me and a host of my peers from participating in my favorite Destiny raid-race experience: chart-making.
Destiny raids are like a cooperative puzzle. Players normally need to communicate information about something that only they can see to someone else who has to apply that information. Shouting “the thing to your left” doesn’t usually cut it, especially in a day-one scenario,…</span>

Meet Thunderbird
 Ubisoft is constantly updating Rainbow Six Siege, and a new Operator is coming to the game along with a slew of quality-of-life changes to the meta. Operation North Star is the next big update, and and the star is Mina “Thunderbird” Sky, an Indigenous Nakoda pilot with powerful healing tech.
Thunderbird carries a trio of deployable healing turrets known as the Kona Station.  She’s a flexible, fast Operator who can get around a defense site quickly to drop her Kona Stations. Players who enter a Kona Station’s radius are healed; the Station then goes on cooldown. Her weapon options include a Spear .308 and SPAS-15, as well as a backup Bearing-9 and Q-929.
Ubisoft is also reworking the Favela map, which is similar aesthetically but dramatically changed layout wise. The Operator Melusi is also getting a rework to make her less of a balance headache for players (her Banshee gadget can now be destroyed by a single bullet.) Operation North Star has tons of changes to make the game clearer and more fun, which are explained in detail on Ubisoft’s official site.
Operation North Star is live on Ubisoft’s test servers on May 25; it is slated to launch to all players in mid-June.</span>

                    <span>With the new Apple TV 4K now in customers&#x27; hands, some users are reporting issues when trying to control video with the redesigned Siri Remote. 





Specifically, some users are complaining that using the circular gesture on the new clickpad ring to fast-forward or rewind paused video isn&#x27;t working as expected. Rather than scrubbing through video continually in the direction of the gesture, the video scrubs back and forth in opposite directions.



From what we&#x27;ve been able to work out, the problem seems to relate to a subtle additional gesture that users are missing out, either because it isn&#x27;t very intuitive or Apple doesn&#x27;t demonstrate it particularly well in the marketing material. 





Try following these steps to get it working. We&#x27;ve italicized the crucial gesture …</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

With no dog in the fight, it’s always fun to pick one.
 In the sleepiest days of the Flyers’ offseason, there’s not much to do in terms of leisure activities aside from watching baseball or playoff hockey. The latter might be a bit painful given the status of your favorite team, but fear not; we here at Broad Street Hockey are creating a brief, yet vaguely comprehensive guide to each division and the teams who you might choose to root for in their quest for the Cup. In the interest of hatred of rivals (a primary interest of any Flyers fan) the East division won’t be receiving this treatment, particularly because Philly fans are familiar with the teams included in that category.
Today’s overview will cover the Central division, aka my home turf. A…</span>

Since Season of the Chosen ended and Season of the Splicer began, players have complained about earning less XP from Seasonal Challenges (a new, weekly Challenge system that offers big XP gains for playing Destiny 2’s various activities). Turns out that the XP gain is a bug, but not in the way you might expect. …</span>

Pick up three weapons and some boots
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:

The best parts of Resident Evil Village have little to do with Resident Evil
 The official title of the eighth mainline Resident Evil game, recently released to fawning praise, is Resident Evil Village. Its creators opted to ditch the established numerical naming for the more evocative and stand-alone “Village,” but frankly, they haven’t given a strong justification for the decision.
Having now played the game, I believe I’ve uncovered why this small verbiage tweak marks a grand reimagining …</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, looking over the Hangar on a staircase.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:

A couple of young defensemen had the opportunity to step up, but they instead fell back.
 Earlier this week, Drew took a look at the netminders and graded their seasons in the first part of our 2021 player grades. Today we’ll be looking at the defense, and, like the goaltenders, there aren’t many positives here.
We’ll only be looking at defensemen that appeared in at least ten games this season, but know that in my heart I gave Cam York an “A” for his thr…</span>

 Necromunda: Hired Gun takes place in the Warhammer 40K universe, but it’s far removed from the central high stakes wars of the setting. Instead, you hangout in the criminal hub city of a Necromunda hive city as a bounty hunter, looking for contracts. You also have a dog, so that’s nice.

Lady Dimitrescu, of course, is the big vampire lady from Resident Evil Village, who everyone on the internet is currently enamored with. This mod allows her to face off against Lady Maria of the Clocktower in a best of three combat.

It’s like Goat Simulator, but for boomers
 Just Die Already is a new game from the designers of Goat Simulator, and it’s a similarly wacky sandbox experience. Players take control of an older person who’s been kicked out of their retirement home, and they’re now on the streets. That’s a pretty depressing game premise, but when you look at the concept in action, it’s all about going wild.

The lottery odds for the 2021 NHL Draft have been released, and, well, the Philadelphia Flyers are there.
 As the Philadelphia Flyers are sitting on the outside of the postseason, there is at least one thing to look forward too — an event we did not see ourselves paying attention to 12 months ago. That’s right, it’s the draft lottery.

 Whether it’s wide-scale team evaluation or at the player level, hockey analytics have really begun to claim their stake in the game over the last decade. Teams are continuously growing more accustomed to the use of data, and are willing to use any and all information available to them. The hockey analytics wars are long gone, even if the egg in your Twitter mentions suggests otherwise; they’re here…</span>

 No Man’s Sky players will soon be able to explore the vast reaches of outer space at a smooth frame rate all the way up to 4K resolution, as support for Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology is coming to the game this month, Nvidia and developer Hello Games announced on Tuesday. 
DLSS is a feature exclusive to certain Nvidia graphics cards that aims to bring improved performance and image quality to games. The process takes lowe…</span>

Movie heroes John McClane and John Rambo are the stars of the midseason patch
 Call of Duty’s midseason update is all about action movies and the heroes that make them great. In the first trailer for the Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War ’80s Action Movie update, we got our first glimpse of John McClane and John Rambo in action. 
The trailer itself is styled like a trailer for an ’80s action movie might be. It’s got a cheesy voice-over, lots of film grain, and …</span>

Wait, forget Ethan, what’s up with that Heisenberg line?
 Resident Evil Village is a thrill ride of a game, taking players through a series of rich environments and battles with distinct, memorable bosses. There’s a lot of detail to pick apart and examine in the game, but I’m stuck on one question: Why does Karl Heisenberg, a Lord of a highly cursed Romanian village, know that Chris Redfield punched a boulder while inside an active volcano one time?

 Roblox, a massively popular platform where people go to play and make video games, no longer wants the public to think of it as a platform where people go to play and make video games. As Roblox now tells it, it’s a place to go and enjoy experiences. 
Why does this matter? It all has to do with the ongoing Epic Games’ vs. Apple Computer trial, where the game developer and publisher is suing Apple for allegedly stifling competition…</span>

Six-month ban is for not cooperating with Riot’s investigation
 Valorant developer Riot Games has suspended Jay “sinatraa” Won for six months for his failure to cooperate with a sexual assault investigation. The former Overwatch pro player will also have to complete “professional conduct training,” Riot said in an announcement Monday. The investigation has been turned over to law enforcement, Riot said.

How can one rock band be successful, underrated, hugely influential, and criminally overlooked all at the same time?

                    <span>I’m really enjoying what French label, Antiq Records is doing of late. I first discovered them with 2019s Par le sang versé from Véhémence, which made my 2019 year-end list.

                    <span>Whether it’s a product of conditioning or a reflection of the fighting spirit of humanity, we tend to have a penchant for rooting for the underdog.

You’re right when you say this last LP, because if it’s the last we recorded, it’s also the last we will record.This album is Inhumate seventh and last one. We started an heptalogy (seven album concept) back in 1996 and now, with « Eternal Life » we’re ending it. And I think we don’t stop with a slower stupidly sounding doom album. We tried to end with the most bestail thing we could…</span>

Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Montreal Canadiens

It’s prediction time!
 It’s that time of year again, folks! The playoffs are upon us, and you know what that means: it’s time for us to make our predictions and hope that none of the teams do anything crazy and make us look dumb. 
Washington Capitals vs. Boston Bruins

Maddie: This is a weird one. The Capitals kind of seem like the favorite here, but I also keep looking at the Bruins and thinking “man, I don’t know, I think they’re finally hitting that dow…</span>

                    <span>Walking, cities, Paris, and YouTube are four of my favorite things, so this 5.5-hour, 12-mile video walking tour of Paris is right up my alley. Along the way, they visit the Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, the market on Rue Mouffetard, the Jardins du Luxembourg, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and lots more. If you turn the closed captions on, you can read about the histories of the places as the walk progresses. Hopefully this will tide me over until I can visit again. (via open culture)

                    <span>For the past several years, Annette LeMay Burke has been traveling the American West in search of disguised cell phone towers, collected in a project she calls Fauxliage.
As disguised cell phone towers proliferate, I find it ironic that instead of providing camouflage, their disguises actually unmask their true identities. The towers have an array of creative concealments. They often impersonate trees such as evergreens, palms, and saguaros. Some pillars serve other uses such as flagpoles or iconographic ch…</span>

This theory states, that you can not measure two separate parameters of a particle simultaneously. You can either determine one parameter and ignore the other or vice versa, but you can never know everything at once.
Oefner took this idea from the world of physics  and created an artistic equivalent …</span>

Ever since reading his excellent The Island at the Center of the World, Russell Shorto has been one of those writers. His latest piece, The Woman Who Made van Gogh, tells the story of Jo van Gogh-Bonger who, after both her husband Theo and her brother-in-law Vincent died within a year and a half of each other, worked tirelessly for decades to get Vincent’s work out into the world.

This expansion means that there is a cosmological horizon around us. Everything beyond it, is traveling faster, relative to us, than the speed of light. So everything that passes the horizon, is irretrievably out of reach forever and we will never be able to interact with it again. In a sense it’s li…</span>

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.

When the once burgeoning coal industry in Ruhrgebiet, Germany, began to decline, many of the workers’ apartments were sold off.

                    <span>Worth remembering, amidst all the Republican claims that Facebook’s continuing exile of Donald Trump from its platforms is proof that the company is biased against Republicans, that its algorithms are clearly biased in favor of them because Facebook optimizes for engagement above all else, and angry right-wing partisan misinformation is addictive content for wingnuts.

                    <span>Kara Swisher, writing at The New York Times:
In general, I have considered the case of Mr. Trump to be much
less complex than people seem to think. And it has been made
to appear highly complicated by big tech companies like
Facebook because they want to exhaust us all in a noisy and
intractable debate.
Mr. Trump should be seen as an outlier — a lone, longtime rule
breaker who was coddled and protected on social media platforms
until he wandered into seditious territory. He’s an unrepentant
gamer of Faceboo…</span>

                    <span>Peter Kafka was kind enough to invite me on his podcast this week to talk — a little! — about the Epic-Apple lawsuit that started in court this week. I think I articulated pretty well my takes on what Apple should be allowed to do with the App Store and iOS, and what Apple should do with the App Store and iOS. I’m linking here to Kafka’s story for Recode about our discussion, but here are direct listening links for the episode. I say listen before you read, if you have time:

                    <span>Apple likes to claim that the App Store replaced the system of selling software in physical boxes in stores and over the mail.
But it’s not true.
My experience selling apps before the App Store was not unique or new — it’s only interesting now because people may have forgotten this history, and younger people may never have heard it.
Here’s my story:
We shipped NetNewsWire 1.0, an RSS reader for Mac OS X, in 2003 and sold it over the web for $39.95. There were no boxes and no printed manuals — there was not…</span>

Sleep benefits or not, I do find it more comfortable. Perhaps
BYU’s results differ from previous studies because Night Shift
shifts the colors much less than f.lux or blue light glasses.
I’ve long heard from friends and readers who enjoy Night Shift (and f.lux) simply because they feel it reduces eye strain. Comfort is comfort — if you think Night Shift feels easier on your eyes, go ahead and use it. …</span>

People come to Twitter to talk about what’s happening, and
sometimes conversations about things we care about can get intense

That’s why in 2020, we tested
prompts
that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially

Ice makes similar sounds under other conditions, like if you skip rocks on a frozen lake:

Roku is alleging that Google is using the YouTube TV negotiations
to push it to enforce hardware requirements for future Roku
products that could make Roku devices more expensive. This
allegation bears some extra weight because of Google’s own
Chromecast TV streaming device, which is currently selling for $20
more than the cheapest Roku streamer. […]

device maker treats voice search results. According to…</span>

Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza
cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to
minuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the
public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from
spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in
much the same way as SARS-CoV-2, but they are less effective at
jumping from host to host.
As Scientific American reported last fall, the drop-off in…</span>

There is no government data yet on whether health authorities’
