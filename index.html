C because I find it a little simpler for a toy example and also you can do Terrible
Things in C more easily.

Here’s a simple C program that declares a few variables and reads two strings

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
